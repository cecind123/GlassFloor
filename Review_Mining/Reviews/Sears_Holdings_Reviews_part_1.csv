bad,"Pésima empresa para trabajar, si no tienes otra opción, y fuera la última que tengas en tu vida, mejor trabaja por tu propia cuenta, está empresa es tomadora, te exige mucho, trabajas jornadas extensas hasta de 10 hrs o más sin comer y para colmo no te pagan horas extras ni taxi en sus ventas nocturnas y decembrinas por favor no trabajen ahí."
bad,"If you are new to the call center life then I would say Sears is a good place to just start off to learn the basics of a call center. HOWEVER if you are trying to grow within the company and make decent money with good benefits PLEASE LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. You earn literally 3-4 hours of vacation a month after 1 year of employment. Almost impossible to ever take a good vacation. Health/dental is horrible! You want to make over $35k a year??? Not at Sears. Management sucks, the place is a dump. Bathrooms are filthy and broken down every single day. The call center is full of flies and almost everything is falling apart. Please look else where, trust me you will appreciate my review in the long run :)"
bad,"No supplies"
bad,"no resources were given to us in a timely manner to achieve desired goals, favorites were played with disregard for others in the commission payroll as well as lack of general understanding when dealing with sales numbers on personal reports and customer retention."
bad,"Training was food, overall managers not on same page more about getting sales if not put tou down in front of co workers most of the time no help when needed, to much favoritism allow other workers to review your job and make remarks who is not a manager but manager goes along with them."
bad,This company is in bankruptcy and just about out of business completely.  I'm not sure why I am being asked about it as there is no future nor are they most likely hireing anyone. The atmosphere as far as customer service is subsequently horrible.
bad,"Sears is a sinking ship, they will over-work and under-pay their skeleton staff until they burn out. Salaried managers can expect to work five or six 11-hour days. Burn out and turnover are high, store closings are high, sales and credit card application pressure is unreal for (mostly) minimum wage retail workers. This is not the retail job you want."
bad,"I worked for Sears a few years back, and almost just applied again before reading that things hadn't gotten any better. My manager was focused on selling home warranties, and that was it. If I didn't meet a selling quota for them, I would have to stop everything I'm doing, even if I'm at a customer's house holding a dryer up over my head that I finally fennagled into a workable position, I still had to call management so that they could talk to me for 15 minutes about how I wasn't selling to their expectations. Manager also constantly lied about how he used to work in the field like us, but everything he said contradicted that statement. I liked fixing appliances, but them forcing me to try and sell after gaining the customer's trust from fixing their appliance was the straw that broke the camel's back. You could always see the irritated look on the customer's face when you mention home warranties after a job. Won't work here again."
bad,"Untrustworthy, favouritism and stealing.  Very unprofessional.  Will go in tickets and change them to another employee.  Allows employees to take a long break while holding other employees accountable to the time."
bad,You get fired from the job if you don’t get enough credit for the store... Had many arguments with the managers and the customers were on my side. Please do not work here I will try to make as many reports as I can. The boss of the company in Brooklyn is a big fat hypocrite who doesn’t do anything except sit around and talk bad about the workers. Very strict manager who favors certain workers and will treat you like trash.
bad,My immediate supervisors were amazing however store closures not being able to compete in the market outdated company model and poor upper management had led to the demise of a cultural icon
bad,"Sears does not care about its employees. They do not care if you can fix anything, just as long as you can sell a home warranty. They do not let you advance, they want to keep you in a certain position. They tell you they want you to advance but do nothing to let you. Pay is poor for the work. When you work it is all or nothing.  You are either  swamped with work one day and nothing the next. ( so they tell you to stay home).  The most annoying part of job is being on phone to get approval to repair something. Do not even think about replacing an appliance. They throw good money after bad. I was off for a couple months for a surgery. When i came back, they gave my truck to someone else. They told me to ride with someone else for a while. After two weeks they laid me off because I did not sell home warranties. I was not allowed to put any under my name because I had to ride with someone else. I was a plan to get rid of me. I had more experience at repairing appliances then almost everyone there. That did not matter.  After 6 months being laid off, the manager said they wanted to bring me back. That was fine. Next day he said that they did not want me back, they wanted to give me severance pay. Fine, I took it. They said either accept it or I would get nothing. I got 4 weeks pay. They just covered their butts after all the trouble the company is having with severance and retirement payments to others. "
bad,No es una empresa buena y es mucho tiempo para poca paga
bad,"Run away from this organization, horrible work environment not worth your time move on. Pay is low supervisors more prevalent than employees yet they do nothing."
bad,"The manager were rude and never considerate of my schedule. During Ramadan, I was fasting and I needed a schedule before 8:00 and they were making me work til 9:00 pm and I tried to work till before 8:00. I was light-headed the whole time and someone offered to be in the shift, but the manager ignored that fact and never changed it. It was the worst atmosphere ever."
bad,"I was unimpressed by the treatment of the employees and customers by the store management. I was severely disappointed by what I experienced. My issues were with management, not the product."
bad,"This job has you train for 6 weeks just to get on the phones and not make any money they promise commission when very few people even make it, they threaten your job based on upsales and seasonal promotions for customers. This company is money hungry and penny pinching and if u dont like old people yelling at you dont bother with this job. Good thing was the breaks  and other fellow phone takers."
bad,"people are allowed to speak spanish on the floor and make you feel very uncomfortable.  when it's not a company policy to do so.  The Winter Park location is not diverse at all including managers talking about you in spanish on the floor, unprofessional."
bad,"When you get hired you are put on a training gauntlet. When it’s over you may be put in to continue to train with coworkers who have no reason to want you to succeed    The culture is no one in management cares if you succeed, because they expect and create turnover"
bad,Prometo te la pintan bonito que vqs a ganar mínimo 2000 quincenal después que es x comisión del 4% no te pagan pasajes
bad,This place does not care about their employees.poor work environment. Always understaffed.does not p as y any money. very unprofessional managers. Does not recommend to anyone
bad,"Se basan para la contratación en los exámenes psicométricos, el cuál durán 2 hrs y 30 min. El de matemáticas es el más largo es muy estresante y bobo terminas con bastante jaqueca. Es en vano perder tiempo en esa empresa. La peor a la que e asistido."
bad,"the company went under for a reason, management is terrible. not organized at all. pay was very low. part time at best. nothing to write home about. just dont"
bad,Sears formed A and E service to continue ripping people off  stay away from anyone or anything attached to sears. Even the sears exterior business is a sham. Run don’t walk from sears
bad,I didn't like working at the sears of salinas i work a different store and it was way better in every way. The store of salinas auto part was way dirty the floor everywhere also the management is so bad
bad,"Thankfully this company is closed in my area, they treated us horribly. As a high schooler just looking for a part time job they definitely over worked everyone."
bad,The sears i worked at was horrible and they didn't help you much. Even managers..pay was horrible AND working there isn't worth it at all. You do a bunch of work for nothing. Thats why i quit.
bad,"Empresa donde los gerentes estan solo de nombre. Porqe no tienen poder, sobe sus colaboradores."
bad,"Dying company get out while you can. "
bad,"I worked in Fulfillment online orders. The supervisor was young and only able to relate to youngsters in college or 23-25. The supervisor act the age of the youngster and ran to Management as a child when she wanted her way.  The supervisor took everything personal and could deal with adults 50+. There was a,strong negative/political click. They took advantage of youngsters, disrespectful and not grateful "
bad,"Sears as a company had the very best employees staffed there, However they suffered with the realigning of management. Not enough hours available to cover the demand. The Higher ups wanted miracles with minimum employees."
bad,Local store is going out of business. Poorly run from the top down. Only a matter of time for sears to close forever. Force you to try and sell a credit card with a 29 percent interrest rate that no one needs
bad,"Mala administración por parte de los jefes"
bad,"No opportunity to grow."
bad,None nothing to speak on concerning this job there s nothing I could say about this employer accept the pay is not good the part-time work is not worth the drive
bad,"when i first started with Sears back in 1988 it was a great company to work for but as the years went on it became less of a great place, the company no longer cared about its employees, they only cared about cutting costs and making money for the big wigs."
bad,They are a terrible company to work for. They expect you to put our life on hold  for their bottom line. Management and Human Resources have little respect for their staff.
bad,great place to work until the incompetence of upper management caused company to close.  this took a toll on many employees and families.  people are now relocating and looking for work after a lifetime of dedication to this company.
bad,the manger work over there is faking annoy and is fear by all and if you do one day request he star cut my hours from 38 hours per week to 15 hours and he hiring me by 9.50 per hour.
bad,they could care less about the customer as long as you sold a home service contract that was offered by cross county  sell sell sell washer magic 3 bucks at lowes 15 off the truck
bad,They told me i would be diagnoising problems with appliances.  Not once did they mention selling products.  They wont help you achieve their requirements.  There is no way to report problems about manager.  My manager keeps hitting the back of my chair.  They tell you to do one thing then chew you out for doing it.  Not consistant rules for all
bad,Pésimo empleo a menos de que seas un borreguito que no piensa y no le molesta ser pisoteado
bad,"Didn’t really have much customers and I’ve always caught someone stealing back to back. Others thought that it was easy money, but my problem was not getting enough customers and having to find something else to do."
bad,"Stay away... worst job I’ve ever had, I stared out as an hourly employee and moved into a salaried position. We had mandatory 6 day work weeks with a random week day off. No one cares about this job as employees, look elsewhere"
bad,"Poor management from the top down. My store went from having a store manager to no one in charge in 3 yrs. By far the worst run store in America. They closed my location and every location in mid Michigan. But,I can buy craftsman tools at Lowes and Manards"
bad,"It's soooo boring, the computers are operating on a 1950's system and are so slow. You're literally forced to sell credit cards and the customers get aggravated and say no. I was hired and wasn't put on the schedule for a week. Worst experience for a first time at a retail job. You barely get any hours, and is not worth the pay. Wouldn't recommend!"
bad,"very poor culture you never new what your job was day by day, very poor management. dealing with management they never knew any thing always thronging people under the bus"
bad,No hay liderazgo ni se preocupan por sus empleados
bad,Your hours were constantly slashed if you were getting enough people to sign up for their credit cards. Management was a joke and if you were in the hospital after having surgery they would constantly call you about getting a sick note.
bad,Do not work for them. Worst job ever they are absolutely horrible. Just pass their application up really dont even take the time to read this horrible review!
bad,"I was threatened by the management that if i didn't open any of the credit cards that i would be fired. Even though i asked every customer, even customers that only spoke Spanish and i still couldn't open the credit cards."
bad,"I worked for Sears twice for over 9 years. They were once a great company to be in and I learned so much as a Manager but now it is a joke. Leadership is just trying to survive, everything is knee jerk and you are treated awful."
bad,"Don’t ever work here, management is the worst I’ve ever seen, multiple managers none are ever at the store, you’re left alone  day long. No breaks, no training"
bad,Horrible work environment. Management is non existent and unsupportive. Loss prevention works with management to lay off employees. No breaks no meal time. Managers give hours to friends.
bad,"the job sucked so bad. The best part was clocking out, no support from managers nor co workers. Pay was terrible. Worst company I've ever worked for. Avoid!"
bad,Working for Sears sucks  The amount  Of pay does not justify the amount of work we are given As a service technician we are required to sell a product That is not worth the money they are charging customers as far as the home warranties  Customer service sets up the service technicians for failure and angry customers when we Arrive promising them services we don't offer
bad,the atmosphere is very oppressive and they use employee rivalry to keep you distracted from this. If you get sick and had to miss days - even if you have a written excuse they threaten you with loosing your job.
bad,"7 years with the company in total, just to have your position be eliminated. Less than a year after that, the store closed. Sadly, I was part of an end of an era."
bad,"Everyday was always busy. You barley could've taken a part that how busy the company was. I dispensed eyeglasses, put prescription into the data system. Verify insurance, make appointment and reminder calls to the customer."
bad,This place is horrible. They don’t care about employees and the whole place is screwed up from the top down. Been there a year and the district manager has changed 4 times. That tells me they can’t even get their stuff together on a corporate level so of course the store level is going to be a mess
bad,"Sears is the worst place to work, they don’t care for the employees at all managers from top to bottom are all puppets no support at all on the Field it’s all about selling these home warranty’s which not as what you think all in all the work culture is very disappointing don’t do it"
bad,"All you get in angry customers because all the sear stores are closing so when a customer needs a tech for an appliance repair they have to wait several days, sometimes weeks!"
bad,I'm gald this company is going out of business they do not care about the employees and do not py enough and also management is trash.They do not care
bad,Worked here for about 3 months. The work setting was unpleasant. Management didn't make you feel welcome at all. They would send you on your break at random times even if they already set your break time at the beginning of the week. It takes forever to get them to listen to you. There's literally no point in working here unless you're absolutely desperate for a job.
bad,"This was my first real job out of high school and it was awful. The work itself wasn't bad but the people I worked with and the expectations from management were ridiculous. I was constantly left picking up the slack from at least 4 other workers and had no benefits or raises in doing so. I can honestly say this was the worst job I've ever had. Not to mention the pay was terrible, as were the hours, and limited break time."
bad,"Unorganized and miscommunication. You get to work with what is given to you, training consist of one day on hands, they will leave you to work on your own and when you call for help no one is there to help you. Understaffed and also management sucks, they are unprofessional and lack professional etiquette. Staff tries hard to work with what is given to them but it's understaffed that it comes to a point that the staff no longer cares."
bad,Poor management. HR gossiped about everyone including the manager. Petty behavior. Snide comments from the manager to supervisors and other employees. No training. No raises. No help. Hours cut all the time. Manager comes and goes as she sees fit. Employees are not informed of changes. Until the manager get her butt in trouble by the DM.
bad,company was in a bad place at the time of my employment. Staff was a secondary thought and I cant say anything good about the company. Work life balance was not a thing in their eyes
bad,I only worked at Sears for about a week and they didn't train me or give me a schedule right away after orientation. It took about 3 weeks for them to finally get back to me and make schedule and it took for me to contact them because they forgot about me.
bad,"Se nota mucho favoritismo con las personas que llevan más tiempo, en ventas especiales o nocturnas trabajas horas extra sin paga y los horarios de comida no se respetan así como los descansos."
bad,After 21yrs working as a home repair technical force out over New tech manger.lies.no help from union.business not going well stores closings get rid of top rate tecks.
bad,"If your a great sales man with no ethics. This is the job for you. they dont care if you fix the appliances, they just want you to sell home warranties, so they can get a commission check at the end of the year,"
bad,"Just not the place of employment for me, very unprofessional. Manager needs to know how to talk to customers, never worked with people who are all over the he place."
bad,"Poor management, family members working on same teams...cliques atmosphere...only people that they keep are total Brown Nosers...to keep a job there, you have to kiss butt...terrible employer...no wonder they're going broke."
bad,"You are a warm body,needed to catch shoplifters,,,,Nothing more."
bad,"As stated above, it was awful and i regretted working there, beginning the dirst day and was happy to give my notice. Based on my experience  i know i will never work for sears again"
bad,"Long hours, low pay, threatening work environment no advancement company does not care about its employees only about how much money they can squeeze out of the customers"
bad,"Poor management. Scheduled for work during school hours. The management made me choose between school or work, I was a high school student still so I choose to continue in school."
bad,Not a great place to work not treated fairly as an employee they will make you work almost every one of your days off so they can make up for the people that did not go in.
bad,"Most evil company in History"" for the love of all that is great in the world don't work here. They destroyed my life!!! Absolutely Worthless company. Please don't work here""!!!"
bad,"Sears is a very unethical company to work for, with little to no room for advancement from within, and the pay/commission is ridiculously low. I wouldn't recommend working at Sears to anyone."
bad,"Biased and racist leads and management, the pay is awful considering the amount of work they require of you, always understaffed and high turnover rate. Forced to get customers to apply for their loyalty program and credit card to the point where it felt like harassment as they monitored how many people you've gotten to sign up."
bad,"Poor management, a typical day at work was extremely slow with nothing to do, we were not allowed to leave during a snow storm and got stuck in the building."
bad,"This job provides minimum pay for maximum effort. They are hiring people to help steer a sinking ship. Avoid Sears as much as you can, unless you really just need a temporary job."
bad,"Managers ignore you and are downright rude to new employees, treat you as if you're stupid and only care about how many credit cards you have sold that day."
bad,Very unscrupulous manager. You are required to work strictly on commission which is based on sales figures yet those sales are not usually concluded within one interaction with Client. The manager allows his veteran sales agent to take over your sales and convert it to theirs. They do not have any on the floor training plans yet processes presented on the computer are mostly not  reflected on thethe experiences on the floor.floor.
bad,Manager only cared about metrics and what you did to get them even if it meant making customers unhappy ...then your metrics determined the hours you recieved
bad,I really hated this job. The company is so disorganized and changed hands so many times. Employees are not kept well informed and management shifts all the time. Horrible place to work.
bad,"Management did not give you an opportunity to succeed. All the best clients and areas are given to vets and the poor areas given to new guys. Only one or two people are left out of every new class of 10-15 because of their all commission based pay, most people dont get enough sales to survive while the top dogs are basically handed high paying clients."
bad,No it really sucks..really bad.. The management sucked and the company in general didn't care one bit about the employees. They got rid of employee discounts and other employee stuff they used to have when Sears was actually a viable place to work.
bad,"Company went out of business for so many reasons.  "
bad,It was always extremely hot inside the store almost unbearable to work. I wouldn’t recommend sears to anyone and your schedule will change everyday just about without warning.
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. there is no job security at all, an awful experience with awful leadership  Run, run as fast as you can.  Run as fast as you can in the opposite direction"
bad,"Inconsiderate management, disrespectful peers, stressful."
bad,Worse company on earth 1 step from a beat down management dumps on sales which dumps on warehouse which dumps on delivery everybody says anything if it will keep their jobs and lie to customers and stab you in the back with a smile
bad,Working at Sears was a reality I wish I never knew. It is the messiest co.  In existence. The warranties they make you sell are fraud. All of the customers are misinformed and frustrated. All of the billing is wrong. The training is terrible. Not once did I get an accurate pay check. The same for other coworkers. This place should not be in business.
bad,Look somewhere else for employment. Poor work life balance. Lousy benefits. No career growth. No respect for employees. Way too much overtime. Mandatory Saturdays at times.
bad,"Mala experiencia dentro de la empresa, cuando tienes valores y los aplicas eso no vale. Desafortunadamente protegen a las personas nocivas. Los acusas por las malas acciones y salen premiados. Qué pasa? Hay que robar para crecer y hacerte amante de los jefes? Así es y es aplaudido."
bad,Never will I ever work here again. There's a reason Sear was or is going down hill. The policy's are a joke just like the position's there. Most of the management team is Hispanic and they favor other Hispanics.
bad,The upper management for sears is a complete joke and is only out for one thing there bonus. They do not care about the employee and that’s the reason they are going out of business
bad,It was not a good experience. I quit within the first year. I liked my job I was jewelery lead but the pay was not good and the stress was worse.i would not recommend this job to anyone. Plus they are closed.
bad,I don't think it would matter what I have to say about my time with Sears since they are closing stores all over. I will just say that I am still owed money for my last week of work and it has been 2 years and still waiting.
bad,"No fue lo que esperaba , te dan muy poca comicion el 3% menos todo lo que te rebajan , necesitarías vender miles y miles para poder sacar una quincena agradable ... y no lo que pagan 1800 menos lo que te rebajan te llegan 1300 que es muy poco dinero así sean 6 horas diarias ...."
bad,Needs more education on diversity and culture at sears and better job at taking signs down of old sales so customers don’t freak out at cashiers better management overall
bad,The amount of work they asked you to do on a daily basis (mainly DOING SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB FOR THEM) was ridiculous when my pay was based on commission.
bad,There are a few unprofessional negative members of management that harass employees and get away with it. Negative hostile work environment. Even if you report these people to Human Resources nothing is done.
bad,The 4 years I was with I had to close 3 of them. If you are not full time you don't get enough hours. I started in the cash office and worked my way up to Softlines lead management.
bad,"Unfair, hostile work environment. Training is almost none. Management is deceptive shady. Management would rather ship incorrect merchandise to customers than find out why inventory counts are wrong."
bad,"This warehouse had many downfalls to working for them. For starters they lie in the interview process to get you hired. I was informed i would be a ""material handler 2"" and be trained to run equipment around the warehouse. I had to pester the manager to put me in the system properly. For 2 months i was being paid as material handler 1 and doing the work of material handler 2. Finally had me in the system correctly so i can earn the proper wage or the work that was being done by me, but i kept getting forgotten about for my training. On top of this my department had hired a supervisor that knew absolutely nothing about the warehouse. Anytime questions arose he could not answer them for us and we would have to figure it out on our own and then tell the supervisor how to do it so he would know for later. Countless occasions i caught supervisor taking product and moving it around the warehouse with out doing it through the system so product was getting lost, and he had the gaul to blame his employees. this resulted in multiple people being fired over failed super. Countless complaints were brought to manager of the warehouse and countless times I was told I have no position to say anything about who they hire. Overall this place is a joke and honestly could use some looking into they way they operate"
bad,Worst place ever alot of mental abuse work hours less than 12 hours a week commission + 4.00 hour Went out of business Management Harrassment was the worst and not enough employee
bad,No you do not get overtime or a pay raise . Management are not good at all. You train someone who is hired at more money and they never worked retail.
bad,"Employees were frequently yelled at and humiliated in front of customers.  Promotions were only give to family member, even when others were more qualified."
bad,"No help, no overtime, no advancement, no raises, no time off, customers always get money back no matter what. Managers never took your side. I was there almost 5 years and no time accumulated, this company took money from me, took half my 401k."
bad,"Making layoff March from manger to July 1 after the In May, I was definitively rejected because the work is small and they cannot do without the old technicians Now they demand a refund [  bonus ] I'm working 9 months"
bad,"This was the worst compnay I have ever worked for, manager tried to run shop as her on personal shop, pay was horrible and service advisors didn't know what to sell."
bad,"The culture is toxic, the pay was extremely low, overall a terrible place to work. The management didn't care about its employees or its merchandise, this store had Cameras that didn't work, so much for security."
bad,"You're set up to fail. Loss prevention has a bounty on your head. Their goal is to accuse employees of stealing because they get a $1500 commission if they ""catch"" you stealing."
bad,Focus on selling credit and protection plans more than anything else. Store manager is a micromanger and very difficult to work with. Huge turnover due to management. Was not taught the job that was hired for as store manager didn't think anyone could do the job as well as she did. Only allowed to do parts of the job and on a limited basis as she could get by with this to keep from being red flagged by corporate.
bad,Work your but off cleaning carpet. Management doesn't appreciate anything you do. 100% commission job. Trying to get people to buy more services they don't need so you can build the ticket for the company. Horrible hours 6a.m. until? You never know when your going to get home. Terrible company don't work their.
bad,upper management cares nothing about employees . work you through lunches. makes promises that are not kept. equipment out of date. unwilling to work with you are schedule. pushes extended warranty
bad,"At my time at Sears one of the managers over me tried to be a friend and a boss, didn't work out. She would tell me to do multiple things at once then tried to fire me for no good reason. Making up excuses to cover her butt. Meanwhile I was picking up everyone's slack. When I put my two weeks in they got bitter and crossed me off the schedule. I'm glad they are out of business and not there."
bad,"Management only care about them selfs and not the employees. They have a problem when you use parts out of your truck stock to complete repairs, and they used that against you when it comes time for incentives. They rather you "
bad,This was by far the worst place I’ve ever worked. The customers screamed at you about points. Management refused to help you when you got out of training. The whole work experience was dreadful.
bad,"no recomendable, es muy tedioso trabajar ahi, el ambiente laboral es muy nefasto."
bad,Horrible place . Especially in Newport Mall in Jersey city. Nothing but rats in the back. Infested. Pay was only like 9.10 . Boring no customers cause they’re going out of business and I don’t feel bad the clothes are so ugly and outdated and they wonder why y’all going out of business . Sorry you have to keep up with trends to survive in the business
bad,"Management had favorites that could do whatever they wanted. Working there was a bad experience for a good person. Management was terrible and did not care about their employees, only their ""numbers"". People were cheating the system and when management was informed they rewarded these people with employee of the month parking and gift cards."
bad,"The owner wasn't around much but quick to point the finger at someones mistakes. Wasn't really flexible with school, and didn't give much leeway on installations that took a little more time than it should."
bad,"Mal ambiente, sueldos bajos y sin calidad de vida "
bad,No support for people who are going through issues and who are struggling. No remorse for people who are on public transportation traveling to the location.
bad,"I worked for Sears during the Christmas season of 2015, and I was very stressed out almost all of the time.  The department that I worked in (shoes) was very small and crowded."
bad,This company prides its self on integrity that's a lie I worked here was told to lie to customers sometimes no lunch never offering a 15 minute break kept it's worthless employees and used and abused the good employees the assistant manager was the worst she was fake and one of the biggest liars horrible pay unorganized schedules sometimes only 3 employees for a whole store Sears needs to be put to rest new manager  I had hope but he let me down too don't work there it will be a horrible experience
bad,"First off i was the first one in my department to get best of blue[company over achievement bonus] in ten years. i received a $100 bonus for it, my manager immediately cut my hour she said i did not need the hours because of my bonus. next month came i still made best of blue that month my hours were cut more. that was the last time i did that. I also became very sick during that time and was seeing a doctor for it. I was fired against wa. State labor laws  for missing work with a dr. note. i filed unemployment they fought it . it went to arbitration not only did i win but the manager was told off for what happened. Hind sight i should've gotten an attorney and sued them."
bad,"The worse company to work, one person there was going to be promoted the next day to be one of the managers and the day before she threat me and say “ wait till I’m your boss tomorrow thinks are going to be different”and that’s the way they work there get a little power and they think they got everyone by the hair.....of course I put her in her place but I regret waist 5 years in that disgusting place"
bad,Poor place to work.  Upper management treated like we had no idea how to work or what we actually could do.  Organization was poor and desperately needed help
bad,"Sears was a very stressful job in the warranty group.  A typical day was customers calling in to check on their parts for their appliances.  Customers would cuss you out we had no access to where there parts were at; when they filed bankruptcy the job got worse people were going without refrigerators 2 months because no one would give Sears the parts. Management would not answer your emails, ignored you very bad place to work. It was a contract through Sitel Inc."
bad,"Training is sub-par. Looking back, my wife and I believe this may be intentional as the less you know, the better chance you will write up a job wrong, which increases the chances that they will take your commission. Yes, completely taking away your commissions on the back end is a very common practice. Yeah, it's a real coincidence how the error you made is the exact amount of the commission you were supposed to get...It happened to me and with other other reps.  Ride along's were specifically mentioned in the training but never happened. Since you're new, they're kind of important. Just a little. I asked about it several times but I kept getting excuses as to why these could not happen. On a different occasion, I was flat out lied to that I would be in the car with a trainer all week. On yet another occasion, I also took the initiative to ask a top rep, who was all for me going out with him. The manager's nixed that idea as well. It's beyond comprehension that they would be so opposed to new reps wanting to go out with experienced reps to learn."
bad,worked here for years and didn't get a raise or an opportunity for growth. dead end place hours are not consistent not for someone who needs stable income
bad,After working at Sears it was no surprise that so many of the stores are shutting down. Management blamed us for the lack sales when it was out of our control who chose to buy things and who didn’t. Hours sucked some weeks I got two shifts. Management was continuously breathing down our backs and the people who shopped at Sears were awful human beings. Do yourself a favor and don’t apply.
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The current manager is an incompetent, chauvinistic weasel.  The employees are treated poorly and the equipment they are given to use is outdated.  OSHA could have a field day in that building.   There are unrealistic credit goals and job performance expectations.  The associates are setup to fail from the beginning and paid far less than they deserve."
bad,"The managers were very rude. I explained on my application and in my interview the days/times I would need off due to medical reasons a month in advance, but they did not respect these. I ended up with two UTIs because they would not let me have a water bottle with me. I am disabled and they treated me horribly. I would NOT recommend."
bad,"The company is unorganized and currently backsliding, if you are an experienced sales person Sears outlet would not be a top destination at all!!!!!!!!"
bad,Employee for 13 years management is terrible corporate is terrible benefits are non existent. Rediculous stress. Terrible treatment of employees snd customers.
bad,"The managers at this establishment do not care about how you feel, they care about how many credit cards you can get people to sign up for. Would not reccomend to anyone who like people, as you are demanded to screw people over with these terribly rated cards daily."
bad,"Horrible place to work, the company focused only on forcing associates to sign people up for the sears card. if you didn't they would cut your hours or not put you on the schedule for weeks at a time. Store manager was a liar, she was the worst person I ever worked for. Long hours, 7am to 10pm, because I was a salary manager. no other store did that, but the store manager got away with a lot so it is either do it or quit. the turn over rate is ridiculous."
bad,"If you work for this company, be prepared to be written up for doing your job. I was a sales person for lawn and garden and got written up because I wasnt doing the cashiers job by getting people to sign up for the membership or credit card. I was busy trying to sale and close big ticket items."
bad,Constant pressure everyday to sell Sears Credit Cards. It was not worth it and the cards are trash. No motivation from your managers. Backstabbing and no accountability.
bad,"They never give out raises to an employee even if they work their butts of for yrs. They treat their employees like they aren't any good and your lucky to be there. Management is a joke and doesn't care about staff at all. They over stress their workers and still continue to over work the staff. Everyone quits within a few months because they can't handle the work load they have to do in just one day."
bad,"Sears is in bankruptcy and serious financial trounle. I believe most will be closing with in a year"
bad,The company has went out of business. They closed their doors. There is nothing to say about them anymore. I liked my job but the supervisor was rude.
bad,"It's not a good place to work. You will get enough hours on season's, you will get 40+ hours a week on season's after season they will cut down your hours like 10 to 20 hours a week. Some of my co-workers got 8 hours a week, they never consider u have a family or u have bills. They doesn't deserve 1 star, my rating is a big zero."
bad,"God awful just plain awful so awfully awful. Poor management. Poor benefits. Poor hours. Poor advancement. Poor poor poor poor everything. If you have someone cursing you out, your manager will stare at you telling you to calm them down instead of helping you with the women calling you the c word 100x"
bad,"Es un trabajo de piso, salarios muy bajos, ni a los solteros le alcanza, no hay crecimiento laboral,  no dan oportunidad de obtener empleos para personas preparadas, el salario no aumenta, y solo contratan personas con preparatoria, los trabajos administrativos son para personas de otros Estados. No está bien visto está Empresa para los Tabasqueños."
bad,"Too many Senior employees that got favoritism"
bad,If you apply for cashier you must speak Spanish and you MUST sell credit card and enroll people to the rewards if you don’t you will get 4 hours a week
bad,Working with customers and the friends you make working in the store are a plus.  But They ask too much for what you are expected to do and they do not care about the associates in the store.
bad,"Expect you to do tasks outside of your job description, even for commission based associates. Expect you to be working even when there are no customers and everything is organized. General manager works by micromanaging and is two faced. She will talk behind your back. Assistant managers and leads are very understanding however. No pay increases ever. No overtime for anyone. Part time gets no benefits. Hours fluctuate. Very unstable job. Company could go under any day"
bad,They hire their friends and unprofessional team leads.  The Management does not give positive feedback to the staff when they make there quotas.  No happy positive surroundings.
bad,"Manager was overbearing and intense. Extremely rude to not only his employees but also the customers. He chalked up his horrible personality to being in the army but that's no excuse for his behavior. He'd openly talk about politics and look for people who don't believe the same thing to argue with. He'd expect new hires to know the ins and out of the job in a few days and mock you for having questions or if you need assistance. Overall, just a horrible person to work under. "
bad,Management was always threatening employees to sell extra products and service contracts to every customer   employees would be told they would get written up or fired if enough extra products or contracts were not sold.  They did not care if the appliances were properly repaired just sell extra things to every customer
bad,"worst job ever. did not like it, pay was horrible and having to sale cards no one wanted and got written up for not doing card sales but not my fault bc no one wanted one"
bad,poor quality products and have extremely poor and unreliable support services. Most of their employees are incompetent and have no idea about the goal of their company and why they are doing what they do.
bad,"I was not happy with the process and advancement specs with company. I was promised a promotion and never did recieve it. So, i looked for other jobs where i could apply my skills."
bad,"I 100% dont recommend anyone working for Sears as a technician"
bad,The sales associate and cashiers were fun to be around and they were the ones who made the store fun with customers.  Management didn't seem to worry about what the employees needed
bad,"They never give raises unless u move up but then if u move up and min wage goes up u dont get anymore. So as a supervisor u will make as much as a cashier because min wage went up. Was making 8.25 (min wage where I live) promoted to supervisor so now making 8.75 so Jan 1st 2019 min wage went to 8.75 so now everyone was making what I made as a supervisor. spoke to HR and managers and was told ""I'll see what I can do"" but of course nothing ever happened. U constantly have to worry about rather ull have a job next week. All the registers are falling apart, it's going to H-E-L-L in a hand basket. It's sad. Even the managers are jumping ship b4 it goes under."
bad,While I worked there the managment was awful and sears has supposed to have been going out of business for a long time now so the hours were so poor there were some weeks departments only had enough hours to cover the managements pay and all other associates went weeks without being scheduled.
bad,"It's a good thing sears is gone now, otherwise others would fall victim to this horrible company and their practice. They pushed every cashier to open credit cards that people didn't want in order to get hours."
bad,dont work here its horrible the pay is low and they were sued becuase they didnt pay above minimum wage and everyone there got money from the class action. horrible place
bad,They promised to pay you incentives and they took it away from you after a year of hard work. Sears decided to give us five dollar gift cards rather than to pay us our incentives. They did not care about the employees as much as their image.
bad,Didn’t enjoy working here manger wasn’t understanding of the hours I could and could not work I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone as they are out of business anyway now
bad,"poor leadership with ""will cross that bridge when we get there. communication doesn't happen. treats associates like liabilities. time off is frowned upon."
bad,Our local store closed after I worked there more than 3 decades. I don't feel it's really fair to give them a rating one way or the other. Personally it was good in the beginning.
bad,Once was a decent place to work but the place has gone further down the toilet as the years went on. I was once making a decent wage but the company cut jobs and lost customer support so I was doing more work for minimum wage.
bad,"Sears is gone my dudes. Super duper gone. 100 percent toast. Not sure what else I can say, it's dead. No more Sears. Gone bye bye. It is an ex-store. Deceased."
bad,Did not finish training.  No regard for associates experience or willingness to advance.  Bad union representation.  Never in same department long enough to be proficient.  No regard for safety.  Women were not treated fairly as able to do men's job. Very low Employee morale. Took on contracts from other companies when they knew they were declaring bankruptcy. Gave employees points for snow days when less than 50% showed up.
bad,"Like other jobs lied about flexible hours to fit my class schedule.The supervisors are rude and degrade employees. My supervisor introduced me to a friend of hers, just do make me feel bad telling her my position paid minimum wage and we had no commission. But first she told me her friend made bank at her store in sales. She should have none she can't make me feel less than her because i actually speak English and Spanish and was working on my AA."
bad,Worked here long ago but at the time it was a good place to work and they respected your input. The best part of working at the store i did was that it was a very family feel
bad,When hired I was as an appointment setter it was emphasized they were not looking for sales (which I purposely avoid at all costs). After 3 months they started a new Home Warranty program which set sales requirements. You had to sell a quota. Not only that after your commission for selling a horrible warranty (would take several months for sears to even attempt to honor the warranty that people ended up canceling due to not being honored) you had to pay back the commission you earned from selling it. Additionally they also changed our bonus structure. Due to the fact that we excelled and went above and beyond what they expected they decided to reward us by LOWERING the bonus. Meaning we were now required to set more appointments for less money. Holiday pay was also reduced to $2 more per hour instead of the time and a half we used to receive. I am no stranger to companies that do not reward hard work and dedication but this is the first one that actually punished you for it.
bad,"not secure place to work. unfortunately, this company won't last much longer.  The writing was on the wall a long time ago...and the value of people by corporation is low in any field."
bad,I fell victim to bait and switch. I was told that I would be working 5 days a week and i na few weeks I was forced to work seven days a week. The hours went from eight per day to 10 per day also.
bad,"I was a minor when I started working here and if I had a choice, I wouldn't have been there. It was just the stepping stone to getting somewhere else, so I am grateful to have been able to get the job but glad that the turnover rate was the way it was."
bad,"I would not ever work there again.  no matter what you did today, you had better do 1,000% better tomorrow the customer is always right and so the manager"
bad,"call center environment. A typical day, work in the mornings talking to individuals who purchase Sears appliances and electronics. My job is to ask if they would like to purchase or renew their Sears warranty agreements"
bad,"Employee turnover was huge. I was hired to work 20 hrs a week, this all I wanted., because of employee shortages I was working 30-to35 hrs, with the promise that my hrs would be cut down.  the training was almost none existant."
bad,Was excited about started my job at Sears.. That shorty changed after 2 days when I realize I was nothing to managment. This store was so completely disorganized and completely an unnecessary mess.
bad,"They have file for bankruptcy so everything is in chaos. The only leads they provide you are leads that people on Facebook accidentally click on unknowingly and end up getting a sales rep out of their home. You walk in the door at someone's house and they have no idea why you're there on every single call. I work there for solid month and did not receive one valid lead. some might argue that you should give it more time but after a solid month and not one lead, No."
bad,hostile work environment. office work decent. management needs improved . higher wages would be beneficial to employees. Decent working conditions would be nice.
bad,The managers don't help anyone.   They don't do anything but sit. They just sit and hide. The cashier will call them for help and they will never pick up to help.
bad,Clueless is the only word that I think describes upper management. Company does not care about employees nor customers. Sad to say people spend thousands on merchandise and warranty service was literally nonexistent.
bad,The management is horrible. They dont know what to do. They Blame others for their issues. They also make you loose hours just because you call out sick and use your sick time. They are not honest people and i wouldnt recommend working for this company again.
bad,"Managers act like it’s a hassle and would literally roll their eyes when you’d ask them for help on something they should have trained you to do. Employees scores go down for not having people put in their phone number and for not getting credit cards every shift, definitely not worth minimum wage. Slow and boring with zero benefits and no positive relationships with management."
bad,"customers were very nice to me and I looked forward to helping them on a daily basis.  I was able to fulfill the wishes and services for 99% of my customers, they were always looking forward to seeing me to help them out with their shopping needs."
bad,"The turn around was very high in the 5 years I worked there. I went through 5 different managers in five years. They did provide benefits, but they were way too expensive to afford. Plus they are going out of business"
bad,"The co-workers were cool, but management was trash.Position was commission based. Not enough money made for the task employer was asking. A lot of customer complaints on manager."
bad,Es metira los de medio tiempo no tienen 6 descanzos y el sueldo es menor a lo que dicen porque los que laboran la jornada completa les pagan 3450 al mes por eso tienen mucha rotacion de personal porque te dicen cosas que no son verdad y las solicitudes que tienes que meter si no las haces te sacan a la calle asi haya mal tiempo y si le dices a la de rh que no vas a aalir porque te puede pasar algo te contesta que para eso tienes seguro y que si te pasa algo tu familia cobrara el seguro de vida no tiene poca madre la verdad
bad,"There were not enough employees. Working there was a little tough as they want you to push the Sears Credit Cards. As a cashier had to also help Loss Prevention, re-stock and many other tasks."
bad,"Corporate is up your butt about EVERYTHING. It isn't worth the $12 they pay you. Its going under and they know it, so you're required to do way more than what youre paid for. Everyone who has left has been way happier. Save yourself the time, it isn't worth it here"
bad,"after working for a similar company for five years, I transferred to sears.  I was treated poorly and wasn’t trained on their point of sale system.  Was unappreciated and scolded for lack of training."
bad,a change at the time and different type of retail job. More focus on selling the stocking. Company didn't invest into people and technology and now is going out of business.
bad,"self-started myself  to  help in  my  division talk to  members  worked  from 8 am 10 pm"
bad,Just stay away...repeat process. This company is in the toilet anyways. Horrible work conditions and management is unbearable. Steer clear of this place
bad,Working conditions were bad.   Very low pay with no raises and no benefits.  The only manage that did anything was let go leaving the rest to stand around and talk and didn't make themselves available to employees.
bad,they don't care about there workers there managers physically assaults there workers then they fire said workers for infractions of a very minor state.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of answering phone calls from customer's with order issues. The agents job was to assist the customer in ordering parts, schedule pick ups for wrong parts ordered, issue refunds, track customer's orders."
bad,"They are thieves in the Home repair market. The only reason people buy from them is because of it being a last resort. They offer financing, but usually there cost is 50% higher than the other guys. Consumer's beware! Twenty percent discount if you don't buy the first time."
bad,Very bad work environment with a lot of pressure and disorganization. The benefits and salary was very low. Agressive leadership. No recognition and high expectation.
bad,Not a place to work for. poor management skills. possibly losing the cause of store closing. The business is poorly managed and you with old and outdated equipment.
bad,"I would not recommend working at this store, however it is now one of the store that are closing due to many things that caused the store to close, it was a matter of time"
bad,Don't Believe anything they tell you from Home Services or KMart teams- especially that this organization will make it past 2020 as retail focus and passion were wiped out with massive layoffs and terrible management.
bad,El trabajo estaba bien no me gustó mucho trabajar para este empleador
bad,The Sear’s I worked at was very bad. Managment was not very professional. There are times you worked 5-6 hours by yourself in peak hours. One time I called HR/management if they could send one person to help out because customers were complaining about there being one associate working in the shoe department. Theft was very popular at my location due to lack of people working. I started with $8.25/hour. They expect you to be able to get a list of jobs done while working by yourself. They basically set you up for failure. You did get a $10 discount. Lunch breaks are offered each shift regardless if you worked 4 hours. One time they only gave me 3 hour shifts and this location was a 20 minute drive for me.
bad,"hard demanding work flow, work well with others, did a lot of preventive maintenance .with little or no supervision. got paid time off and holiday pay."
bad,"My store was shut down and the manager didn't find out about this for weeks. "
bad,"Company is going out of business. Management was horrible. "
bad,"didnt like it, management sucked, hours sucked, staff was annoying and stuck up, always had to ask a billion questions cause my training was a joke, whenever id want to do more than what my job entails and what they said i was supposed to do, they never let me"
bad,"sears has bad management, no set rules. managers do not know what they are doing. no training. not enough help. sears do not treat there employees fair"
bad,"This is literally the worst job I have ever had. They barely train you and throw you into the deep end. Once you are in over your head, they blame you for any mistakes that were made. On top of this, they pry into your life. They manipulate you and make you feel like a dog. There is a mandatory training program on their computer that you have to do when the store is dead. And it is not a training program. It is a waste of time that teaches you nothing at all. This job never ends. The more you put into it, the less you get. Management is extremely power hungry. This may not be true for every Sears. But the one in the Coronado Mall is unfathomable. Would not recommend to anyone ever."
bad,"Barely any customers, management did not respond to pages by employees. I often seen them on their cellphones and not working. There was constant theft. A lot of drama and barely any help. Very unprofessional and inconsistent. I am glad I left before the store shut down 3 months later. There were no benefits. Not even a store discount. You had to purchase their credit card which I was not going to do."
bad,Management sucks and hours are worse never lets some do things thwy wanna do and others get screwed out of hours because they want them doing certain jobs and not others with in the store
bad,"This place is horrible to work for, they dont care about their employees and their management sucks so they take it out on customers. Its not fair and you can't speak your mind at all."
bad,"The Sears environment was a decent workplace. Overtime was often available, and on slow days you were able to leave early in case you had something to do."
bad,"Sears used to be the place to go, work, be. Recently the company filed bankruptcy & the CEO has put lots of position & people displaced with their jobs."
bad,Working for Sears not as enthusiastic than it was expressed. I worked in the fine Jewelry Department and depending on business depends on how fast my days went.
bad,"No security in  job , very poor management. I had to do many jobs that were not part of my job and would not always know if I would be sent home due to no work or not be given hours to complete 40 hours a week. Could not continue like that."
bad,Managers and employees were very nice. Store was always a mess because there was not enough employees on the floor. Not enough hours per week. I do not recommend working there.
bad,"This job had maybe one or two gems that were good, the rest wasn't. To start off a typical work day, it was very unpredictable, you either had so much to do with no time, you had days where no one would assist you, and other days where the managers would ride your butt because you weren't ""working"" fast enough to their unreasonable expectations. You would be put it a different department without your knowledge, your schedule would change without notice and some managers will not listen to any feedback whatsoever. This is the current ""Typical Day"" I face. Some of the employees bust their butts to work hard, and no appreciation or praise is given only criticism. Others are so lazy and don't pull their weight, some managers will sit in the break room and be paid to lounge. The hours are very difficult in aspects of working until close one night, then opening the next morning for several days in a row destroying any sleep schedule you may have had. Theft at this store is very bad, we have merchandise stolen hourly, and corporate doesn't care, our neighborhood has some bad crime in it. Another thing to watch for here is gossip, backstabbing, and bias."
bad,Multi million dollar company closed it's doors due to lack of sales and business. This must tell you enough about the company.This employment was a stepping stone for me in my career.
bad,"I was blindsided after 17 years on the job. I loved my job. I was voted employee of the month twice. We only had  those two times. We had an employee of the year once. One time. I got it for full time employee. I was not late ever, and I did not call in sick. I busted my behind working with a sense of urgency to get as much done in 8hours as I could everyday and loved every minute of it. The bosses came and went. Some were jerks, some were wonderful. Then last July, my ""job title"" was terminated. Just like that. I was thrown away like a piece of trash by KMART. Kmart has made me feel worthless, that I do not matter. The GM did tell me I could reapply for a job at minimum wage, part time. I would have to start all over again at the bottom . He did not have my back. He is just a ""yes"" man. It did not matter about the person in the job title. The person is irrelevant.I am not the only employee that had this happen after years of loyalty. This is a horrible way to treat great workers. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Not even my worst enemy. ( I have no enemies. I can get along with anybody.)"
bad,sears sucks. they make you try and sell credit cards to old people knowing that its a set up because who wants a sears mastercard? its ridiculous tsss
bad,"Stressful and full of negativity. Sears is a company that is phasing out, and it is noticable when you are working on the floor. I never enjoyed working there and the managers were always micromanaging every little thing. Training was almost non-existant and they expect you to know where everything is on your own. I was so lost when I worked there. I don not recommend applying."
bad,Management was horrible. They made you feel bad for getting ill or needing to adjust your schedule. Store manager was more focused on making the matrix than on ensuring his associates were happy. Associate moral was extremely low.
bad,"I start in catalog which was very demanding,and I went from there to customer service in the office handing payments,tax returns etc.From there Service manager on Riverside Dr for about six years."
bad,The focus for Sears when I was there was all about what will raise the profit or bottom line. There was little to no focus on customers or quality of service. The workers were expected to do the work of 3 people with little to compensation.
bad,"Working there sucked, I honestly asked for more hours and they never gave me more hours to work. I would never recommend to work at Kmart to any one. It was an alright first job but I’m glad to move on."
bad,"i would never work with this company again in my life. while the work was not hard, you would always hear the talk about the store going out of business and people not having jobs"
bad,no one cares about you or trains you properly. instead of firing you they will just stop calling you in and leave you hanging. working there was absolutey not good.
bad,I was only 16 and my manager talked to my like her little peasant. She would drop things and make me pick them up just cause she could. She was rude to me and sometimes I would miss my breaks and she didn't care even though I was a minor. She didn't care I had bad anxiety due to the fact it was my first Job ever. She was just a cruel woman. Glad the store is shutting down.
bad,"Well seeing now four later than this company is closing many stores isn't to surprising to me. Job was ok, Technology was out of date for cashier process and selling credit cards for discounts on same day transaction was a bad portion of the job experience. I wanted to sell clothes not encourage others to sign up for something I wouldn't of done myself."
bad,"A typical day is 14+ hours, and a massive amount of driving! I learned that every thing that was told to me about working there were total lies! VERY, VERY BAD MANAGEMENT and they will lie to you and about you! None you are in a service van 14+ hour a day! The very long hours, massive amount of driving in all conditions, that you are expected to be a sales person not a technician! There was no enjoyable part of this job!"
bad,"Basic job to pay for college. Management was, on average, not good while I was employed. I worked two separate positions at the same time for them at 39.5 hours per week (minimum wage) while attending college and was never given a raise."
bad,Filed for Bankruptcy due to not being able to pay their vendors. This made selling very difficult due to items not being available immediately. There was usually 60- 90 days wait for new products.
bad,The E-commerce department was one of the best I've ever worked with. The level of professionalism and can-do attitude in the face of a hectic and unpredictable workload was second to none.
bad,"This work enviorment was very toxic and I had a bad experience, I felt that I was not appreciated in what I did for te company. Managers are also rude and inconsiderate"
bad,"muy mala empresa"
bad,Clock in and do go backs for most of the day and help minimal amount of customers. Management was not helpful the only thing I enjoyed was the cool people.
bad,No comments they are going Bankrupt that about explains everything.   This company was a great place to work once upon a time--then they threw it all away.
bad,"Working the backroom is difficult and busy work. Regularly i was pushed to my physical limits without assistance, then expected to keep inventory perfect while keeping the stockroom safe and functionally organized."
bad,"I got a job at sears during the holidays because I was desperate, and while it provided me with enough to get by it was a terrible experience. Awful management and they would regularly schedule people 15 hour days. Don't work for them."
bad,they shut down my store and laid everyone off with no notice. Despite years of service there was little severance package and it took a ling time to get back on my feet.
bad,Stressful work environment. Lack of workers added stress to the people that were actually working. This was caused by lack of hours provided to the store in order to run business reliably.
bad,I had 10m different managers over the course of 3 years. Terrible treatment of management by other management. Zero support from corporate. The company is a joke after it merged
bad,"Most of my time was training. Like I mentioned, I didn't stay at Sears for too long. I found a better offer elsewhere. I can't really judge on anyone or how the job is."
bad,not much to say about it as business been shut down for the time I was student it was Ok to work there part time ans shortly after i've got promoted to a manger
bad,"Working at Sears was very stressful, although it taught me a lot of patience , I cannot stand being there. I was treated unfairly and they didn't care about the employees."
bad,i load an unload washers an dryers deliver clothes to residents fold an hung clothes an linen. cleaned the dinning room. i learn that they don't treat their employees fair and they seem to want to keep workers that don't work. hardest part was putting up with bad management. i love my residents and getting to know them an their family.
bad,"Management need to be more about the people"
bad,Getting hired here is easy now after you’re hired they care nothing about you . The team managers are never there haves on to assist their team and you’re graded daily by your manager
bad,"Broken Promises"
bad,"El tiempo que estuve en la tienda, 0% compañerismo, Mala actitud del personal de Gerencia, Pésimos guardias de seguridad, 0% cultura laboral. La peor tienda para trabajar."
bad,Part time employment. So I didnt expect alot out of it. It is a job. stocking pricing cleaning disccounts hardest part was unloading the freight truck
bad,"staff"
bad,I hated working at Sears in Hayward Mall they wormin the management was always late they were all over the place they wasn't coordinated they use me for inventory reasons only when I was told I was going to be there permanently full-time they have me in all departments running all around and heels also I called numerous times to get my schedule I was then told after 3 days of calling them that I no longer had a job they didn't need my services I was there for inventory reasons only and come pick up my last check.
bad,"I've worked for the company for 4 years now and the work condition just got worse. When I first started, I worked late/closing shifts and didn't get to work early. Time passed, I was able to work some early shifts. But given the current situation (as of this review) I've been working to close 4 days a week, despite being able to work at any hour."
bad,"Right off the bat the manager cussed me out for only having afternoon and evening availability. If you have another part time job or going to school don't even apply, they will get upset at you for having a life and a limited schedule."
bad,"Awful management, terrible hours, overbearing policies. The cutthroat way to get people to open up credit cards was absolutely awful. Management still expected you to get them while no customers wanted to."
bad,"dirty work area, management looks like they just rolled out of bed, management did not take supervisor calls and lots of age discrimination. ok if you need a paycheck"
bad,Absolutely no communication by upper management resulting in increased workload and customer complaints. Company closing 142 stores with no regard to employees.
bad,"Management horrible, store manager & New Hr is worse. Only one management person was great, others were lazy. Got no hours because of a school schedule. Management always played favoritism. Im glad I left! Horrible experience."
bad,"Supervisors were never around when needed and then they didn’t follow policy with returns. Pretended they didn’t see the cashiers that got in trouble for identity fraud, running credit."
bad,"terrible place to work no hours people quitting every week, no employee discount or raises, slow paced paced job gets bust towards the weekend , management don't care,"
bad,Part -time. Worked there will going  to college. Advancement for only friends and family at store in my area. No future for people of color during the time period I was there.
bad,I'm sure that Sears at one time was on top.  It's been living a slow death with no management.  Expectations were as if we were still on an upward movement in sales..  I was laid off one of the stores that closed.
bad,"The training was awful. There really wasn't any training,you were working weekly plus commission and everyone was always fighting for the sales. My boss was not very helpful we did not get along."
bad,"If you're planning to work here, goodluck. During my time working here management were always coming up to me and complaining about every little mistake I made. One day I came into work without the proper dress attire ""black pants"" and HR told me to go home and change while I already clocked in. Basically I had to spend money during work hours to buy black pants to change into that day. Another thing that was bad experience working at Kmart was the tasks that were given out. One day all the associates had to work at a fast pace to get everything in order, so HR decides to assign me in multiple departments. Only having experience at Men's apparel, HR places me at Auto, Pantry, and Seasonal. Trying to work as hard as I can, HR comes up yelling at me and saying that I am not taking my work seriously and not providing sufficiency to the assigned departments. I was placed in an uknown department and I did not deserve to be poorly treated."
bad,Absolute trash. This was the worst place I have ever worked at. The management doesn’t know how to run a retail store and do whatever they want to benefit themselves
bad,Bunch of lazy workers and lack of working equipment such as hand jacks and electric jacks...No paid vacation hours..No type of advancement for stock associates..
bad,"I was trained to fix appliances and not send out trucks for repairs for the elderly that had warranties on their appliances they purchased, I thought this was wrong.  The customers were rude and cursed you out.  This was my first job as a Customer Service Representative at a Call Center.  Way different from processing Sales and Use Taxes.  I hated this job and would never work for Sears again in their Customer Service Center."
bad,"Never got any time off, my manager wasn't a manager in my eyes because she didn't treat me with respect and dignity. Never got a raise and never got lots of hours while i worked there. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a job."
bad,"The worse job I e ever had. No raises, management never did anything but gossip about other employees, no chance for advancement. I almost didn't get hired because my little sister worked there years before me and the store manager at the time didn't like her so she delayed my application for months."
bad,They really push getting credit applications to the point of rudeness.  Cashier is expected to get a certain number of credit apps. per day.  You are told not to take no for an answer.  personally i think this is being rude.  Manager at my store was not a good one at all.
bad,"it sucks don't do it"
bad,"Company is closing don't bother with your time. They treat their workers badly, management is mostly horrid and you will never see a raise in your life time."
bad,"If only I could give 0 stars. They wonder why Sears is going down like a burning ship, but the company can't even be bothered to treat their employees right."
bad,"My experience with Sears in the last 5 years before I resigned were critical. As a Family the company was divided. It spent more money on hiring people to come in, but not stick around. They broke what they once called ""Customer Satisfaction."""
bad,"Bust your rear end for minimum wage while managers do nothing and get yours hours cut in half for being so sick that you can not breathe or talk, Its so lovely."
bad,Nome services is where they make their money-but this may eventually move overseas. So company is very unstable. Don't care about store closing because internet orders are what's in now.
bad,"count money and count drawers from previous night, make deposits to bank, made sure bank picked up deposits, supplied monies to co-workers drawers when requested."
bad,"place was poor to work for"
bad,"The only thing this specific Sears location is good for is helping you get experience when you're new to working. That's it."
bad,"You go to your assign area and do what the manager ask of you, you learn nothing there, the management there sucks, the workplace there is dead, it's easy and it's not enjoyable."
bad,"A really stressful place. A lot of people and not eniugh cashiers, not much help from management. Not paid enough for all you do. is part time but sometimes you work 4 days 8 hours and one day 4 so you dont get benefits"
bad,"The managers are the reason why I would not recommed SEARS as a place to work for. The maagers will work you to death, not care about your personal safety."
bad,"Poormanagementnoraisesduetothecompanysalesweredownceowassellingoffshares,stocsandwhateerelsetheypromotedsustandardemp,oyeesandmanagementdidnthaenodecentemployees"
bad,"Was not my favorite job. long days, short breaks. No pay. more work and no pay for it. making the schedule 3 weeks early. Had to make changes. poor training."
bad,"Terrible employee support, especially after a work injury. Poor Management communication. All around work environment is very negative and poor attitudes cause low work morale."
bad,Everyone is so rude and very unprofessional. They fight with each other on the call floor and management will not stop it from happening. Everyone sleeps with each other there and gossips so much
bad,The store I worked t is now out of business and now is a different store  Sears was terrible with the way they managed their company.  I would not recommend to anyone
bad,"One manager (at the time, 2016) for sure did not like Asians. I noticed she would be very crude, nag/yell, and be just purely negative to all the Asians. Very obvious when she spoke in Spanish, and she would bicker or mock her staff. Was very unprofessional."
bad,Company is set in their ways that are driving it down.  Dont bother applying. This company sadly will not survive once the dust settles of a brand being sold.
bad,stressful and low pay . too much expectation for job when training lacks. updating the electronic use in store yet the network is super slow and hold back from serving customers properly.
bad,sears wasnt bad its going out of business so there hiring more part time and tempory workers and seasonal workers so they dont have to pay as much................................................................................
bad,"None stop phones of agree hateful people, having to endure name calling , being cussed and hung up on. Belittled..just beyond ridiculous and treated horrible. You are expected to set up all these appointments to fix there appliances over and over when its clear, this cutomer has gotten a lemon."
bad,"I really have nothing great to say at all. Company has been going downhill for about 10+ years. Closing a lot of stores and putting a lot of people out of a job, who have been loyal to the company for years."
bad,"i mainly had to fill the floor, restock items, find web orders and put items in bins. i learned how to unlock trucks and retrieve items from belt. the management was inadequate but mostly unfair.The work culture was very individualistic, finding web orders most enjoyable part was scanning items to the floor."
bad,They had me working sales making 2$ an hour plus commission but never allowed me to sell because they didn't want to take away from their tenured reps. So I was making 2$ to stock the store and do the managers jobs for them as well while they walked around and talked and played on their phones. I also regularly worked 14-16 hour shifts 5-7 days a week just to try to make some money since I couldn't sell.
bad,No training! Horrible management! Unrealistic goals! Terrible pay! Hope they go out of business soon! Terrible company as a whole.  You shoulf apply elsewhere.
bad,"I know Sears is having a hard time right now, but that is no excuse for the mean nasty way they treat me and my team. There is so much to be done as a store support lead and despite all the extra work load they still cut my crews hours and expect everything in a timely manner. I have to sign write-ups all the time because I and my whole crew don't perform to their outrageous requirements. I and my team can even take our breaks or lunches because of the work load. All in all i wish i could find a place that could really use me and my team for what its worth."
bad,Management did not treat staff fairly. Employees could not work together. This was a very unorganized store where managers played favorites and never cared about real situations.
bad,Many new CEO'S over the last few years. Direction changes with every CEO change with the same poor result. Company has a very tarnished reputation which has continued with more and more store closures.
bad,"No base salary.  Commission only earnings IF you are lucky enough to make a sale.  Most sales associates are kept on draw, then let go when they cannot reimburse Sears.  Bad publicity wiped out customer base for the store.  It was a ghost town."
bad,sinking ship horrible place to work managers suck. Favoritism and sexism. Unless your Hispanic you will not be getting a promotion or raise even when it is deserved.
bad,The pay was not equal to the work load placed upon the employees. The manager was not willing to work with my other work schedule. Management was always issuing out faulty equipment with which to work with.
bad,"No recomendable, ni aunque sea de temporada, mal trato del personal y altos mandos del lugar"
bad,"I had to educate myself Sears system in working because they didn't train me. There was nothing enjoyable about working at Sears. Instead, it was highly stressful."
bad,"There is no structure or feeling of job security. There was a lack of leadership. Best part of the job was helping the customers, but I would get written up for it since technically it wasn't my job, so it was considered to be off task."
bad,"This Job is good if it is your very first work experience, not in the long term. There is little room for advancement and the company does not offer enough hours for employees."
bad,I worked at Sears in Orland Park mall in Illinois and it was terrible. Pay was little to nothing. All they care about is getting you to make customers sign up for credit cards but nobody even shops at Sears!!!
bad,The star rating I provided will speak for itself. One major flaw was the benefits provided by the company. Another was the overall environment at the site I worked at did not feel safe and was very out dated.
bad,There are many great retail clothing companies out there. Sears is going out of business for a reason. I believe the culture of the company is what is driving it down. They really push you to sell their credit card to customers.
bad,"When I did work there is was a commission job it was 18/20 years ago part time I did ok.   Did not know ceo and as for managers ,  back then it was who you knew not sure any of them were really managers just needed us to sell."
bad,"working for sears for the time being was a decent job, however sears is going out of bussiniss and i would advise not working for them in the furutre!"
bad,This is a once proud company that has fallen on hard times and failed to adjust to the changing retailing landscape. Soon to be on the scrap heap of history.
bad,"Clock in and bust your butt for 8 to 10 hours a day, or sit there for 8 to 10 hours a day. Sears was a feast or famine shop when I was there. There was ether to much work or there was no work."
bad,"poor company, poor working conditions, poor management, not able to pay associates more than min wage, unable to compete with other companies for qualified workforce."
bad,"I worked as the Store Supervisor for the Sears Parts and Repair Center in Fenton, MO since August of 2016. I just finally quit on July 13th, 2018. And here is why.. This is a terrible company. They dont give raises or anything else they promise you. They throw you into a position and expect you to just train yourself, which is what i personally had to do. Then you get in trouble if you dont do something correctly, even though they never trained you. Upper management is horrible. They make decisions that do not directly effect them without consulting the employees that it does effect for feedback before making the final decision. When they close your store you get no notice of it until the day it happens and then they expect you to stay and close your store, pack it up, and ship it out. If you dont stay then they threaten to take your last paycheck. The District Manager does not at all care about his employees and other staffs needs or wants or suggestions like he acted like when he first took the position. I honestly have nothing positive to say about this company. I quit a few days ago, without a back up job so im now unemployed (i know dumb, right?) But it was actually the best decision i have ever made. Im happy now after that company dragged me down for 2 years. Honestly the only reason I stayed was because of my regular customers who were soo awesome!!"
bad,"The Sears Call center was a horrible place to work. they're closing most of their stores and call centers, and I understand why. management was poor. they didn't stand by their employees @ all. the products they carry are subpar @ best."
bad,"This is a notoriously failing company.  The hours are long, the job stressful, high expectations, very low pay. It is predicted each year that the company will go bankrupt."
bad,i cannot recommend sears at this time.  there is no typical day.  you come each day with something.   it is very difficult to take off even with a crisis.
bad,"Not the best work environment.. Not that clean of a store... They had a gnat problem while I worked there, but I didn't complain because I was in need of a job."
bad,"Terrible company. They will be out of business in a few years anyway, so your job security is nothing. You couldn't pay me enough to come back to work there."
bad,I won't go back to cudahy store. Fam n friends wont shop there any more. The employees there are so rude to customers. They all need to be replaced. They are too busy visiting with each other and mocking customers amongst themselves. No time to help anyone out.
bad,No job advancement. Low pay. Horrible Managers. Hope they close all sears and Kmarts . No team players. No vacations . No training. Everything in the store is so outdated . Registers kept freezing and always has to reboot everything.
bad,this job was not a good place to work. They would use you only when they feel like they could afford hours. They where majorly understaffed and did not like to hire people.
bad,"Working at Sears wasn't fun nor enjoyable. The customer service sucked just because the job was so terrible no one really cared. I wasn't treated very nicely by some customers, and sometimes management would force me to sign people up for a Sears card, which went against my morals, I couldn't think about getting someone into debt with terrible interest rates."
bad,"This organization, had it been run better, with a focus on staying dynamic would have been a great company to work for however, their lack of vision has caused them to close multiple locations."
bad,"Sears management only cares about selling the sears cards. They lack appreciation for the associates if you cannot get credit your hours will be cut. They promise raises to only those who receive credit “"
bad,"Sears now pays only minimum wage with zero benefits for employees. You never do just one job...I was a cashier, and MCA, the phone operator...and management is always too busy to respond to problems or issues in a timely manner. As an employee your primary goal is to sign up customers for the SYW program and get them to apply for one of the credit cards. You have a goal of 2-4 applications per shift and go through unproductive DAILY 'coaching' when you don't meet that goal - which is almost never. You actually have to fill out a sheet daily tracking how many SYW members you had, how many were NOT members, who paid with a Sears CC and who didn't...customer service is terrible by design and never counts in  your favor regardless of how well you handle transactions or people. It's just a stressful, demeaning and extremely unsatisfying place to work. No one ever goes home in a good mood."
bad,"This place is horrible and has too much favoritism. lack of communication, organization and planning. no teamwork or cohesion here at all the morale here is  horrible"
bad,"Less pay needs to have Hours Mon-Fri, instead of work 7 days a week. Need to provide more job opportunity to individuals, and I think shouldn't be allowed to work holidays you should be off."
bad,"I felt very consistently unloved and unappreciated. My pension was stolen, and I feel cheated out of many hours of my life for little pay. I wish I had a different job."
bad,What can you say about Sears. It's dying and closing stores left and right. It's only half what is was a few years ago. If they had taken their main catalog and put it on the internet they would have been the Amazon of today. They missed a great opportunity and now they are paying for it.
bad,To many sales people working at the same time. The pay was base on commission so it was hard to make a living because there were not enough customer visiting the store.
bad,I left this job because the hours sucked and the pay was the bare minimum. If you couldn't get people to apply for credit cards you weren't good enough. They tried to retrain me after about a month because I wouldn't push credit cards for a store no one shops in. I wouldn't even step in this store ever again even as a customer.
bad,"The only thing Sears cares about is money. I get that they are not doing well in the market, but they do not care about their employees. You get in trouble if you don't sell their credit cards or if you don't get customers in their rewards program."
bad,it was a place to make money and work. its not really busy like it used to be and there arent much stores left to really work at in orlando. however it did pick up on holidays
bad,"pay was well below what you would need to live on, didnt get many hours, training wasnt done very well, supervisor didnt even know i was coming in that day"
bad,The company no longer exists in Canada. It went bankrupt and I worked through until the very end when we were selling off everything that wasn't structurally attached.
bad,"they require you to force credit cards on the customer, even going so far as to do it without the customer's knowledge. if you don't meet the requirement for credit cards they cut your hours or fire you. it is a horrible place to work and I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
bad,the place was bad I was so stressed working there I just wonted to go home after working and try to find something to do differently. I hated my boss he was a very mean man that needed help.
bad,"No son muy profecionales, obligan a los laboradores a trabajar horas extras sin ser pagadas ni reponer días si son bastantes horas extras las que los hacen laborar"
bad,"You are lied to by the company by upper management, they close with hardly any notice they treat staff as if they are nothing. The worst job and position i have ever had. A waste of time and energy"
bad,The company is toxic to its employees and they are treated like garbage 5 different management changes in 5 years was not an ideal working environment
bad,i quit sears because of the unfair management. they weren't paying nearly enough for all the work the associates had to do everyday. overtime they made the work schedule inflexible
bad,Save your life and run in the opposite direction. Retention rate is 2 to 3 pc. Employees leave either out of utter frustration or they get sacked. Not for career minded people
bad,I did not really like working there beacuse they always wanted you to sell the customers on applying for the srars credit cards and the cards have such a high rate
bad,"Again, I needed a job and that was all I could find at the time.  I really liked my supervisor and most of my co-workers.  The insurance was barely worth having and the pay was low but I had a job and I survived. The few times I have been there recently it is very empty.  Most of the people I worked with are no longer there."
bad,"Didn’t like the environment it was too stressed and they made you bother people about applying for a sears Grand credit card and I️ didnt feel"
bad,"I worked as a Backroom Associate, which is a physically taxing position. Unloading and loading trucks as well as maintaining inventory and organizing the warehouse. Replenishing big items to sales floor. Broke my back working for this undeserving company. Would not recommend."
bad,This review is for Sears Outlet. They don't follow equal employment laws or labor laws. Management is disrespectful to customers and associates. I liked working for this company the first few years but now that we are under new management things are going down hill.
bad,I worked for the photo studio and it closed without notice. It did not let the employees have time to call the clients to let them know what was going on.
bad,"Terrible place to work. They do not compensate you well, it is disorganized. Unprofessional, it is no wonder it is going out of business. They promise raises and you never receive them."
bad,"I was drawn to work at the White Oak Sears location, because of their policies on work place environment. The majority of those policies are just written on paper and not upheld. The work environment can be hostile. The highlight of my day would be assisting customers. Managers would ask for availability from workers and still schedule not according to their availability, making it difficult to work around prior commitments and work. I started off with a great schedule, but as time went on, I would either get full-time hours (while being part-time) or little to no hours at all. Hopefully things have changed at this location."
bad,Fired me for reporting time fraud sears outlet milpitas dont work there unless you dont want to get paid I was always scheduled to close alone I didnt have support in the store I wasnt even trained right and was held accountable for it when I was the only one who even knew anything
bad,A typical day was to greet customers and offer help
bad,"Extremely slow paced, management does not believe in advertising, so no traffic is brought to the store.  Lots of demands from management, no traffic or tools to get to those goals on behalf of store employees.  Too many hand written advertised sheets all over the store, looks tacky and old fashioned."
bad,I disliked working here the pay was terrible and the hours available were even worse. The commute there and back was a hassle. The managers didn’t care if you had children or not they always wanted you at work.
bad,"Sears is not a good company to work for. The store I previously worked at is now closed due to poor management. The store had been located in my hometown for YEARS, but when new management took over they ran it into the ground."
bad,This company has very poor upper management and they have no idea what they are doing. Company is almost out the door. CEO is making himself rich every day and selling off company piece by piece. I wish there was a federal law that what a CEO is allow to do. CEO needs to go to a management school to learn how to manage a multi million company. Thousands of people are losing jobs as Sears going out of business.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible treatment of employees and customers alike.  The core business still has value, but they can not get out of their own way."
bad,Store was too focused on credit applications and signing customers up for rewards instead of being focused on delivering great customer service and having items in stock - not having to order online.
bad,Is was a good job while it lasted the company went down hill in the last few years. Sears went bankrupt  last year so this company no longer exists...
bad,This was my first job and the only good thing about this job is that it makes every other job so much better because there is is so much wrong with this job and the management at sears is also terrible.
bad,"In all honesty this job was the most stressful I have ever had. This company puts way to much pressure on associates to do things like ""get 3 credit card applications a day"" which is not feasible in a low income city. Also the work-load does not match the pay, and there's no growth in pay unless you go from associate to a manager. Overall I would not recommend working at Sears to anyone due to the facts of low pay and that the company stresses things that should not be as big of a deal as they are."
bad,"low pay to basically break your back while working in the warehouse center, with little to no staffing, would not reccomend working here, management was good though"
bad,"While being a Point of Sale employee is not something you'd characterize as glamorous at any company, they made sure it was misery. Management was terrible, incompetent, and half the time did not know how to function."
bad,company that had no clue what direction it was going in. weirdest customers possible and some of the most uneducated workers to be in one job that should never be working in retail
bad,"at first i did like working there. when i realized they gave you hours based on how many credit apps you get. i became annoyed, then they were trying to pay me for 1 week when we got paid every 2 weeks"
bad,aucun respect pour leur employee meme ceux qui travail depuis plusieur annee
bad,"The pay and benefits were ok, but you do not want to rely on this job to pay bills, but to help out with bills.  I did enjoy using my creativity to help arrange displays to make them appealing to the customer."
bad,Leaders are responsible for the culture of the store and they missed the mark in this environment. There was harassment involved daily by one of the managers.
bad,Wasnt the greatest place to work. They didnt give hours out and the shifts were short. The location i worked at it was mandatory to take a hour non paid break even if only working for four hours.
bad,It was a stressful work working with the employee and some customers.  The hardest part of the job is the manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working one of the managers.
bad,"this was a job I had in high school and because of it I will never work another retail job again, some of the poorest management I have ever seen and no room for growth within the company, again because of poor management."
bad,Very busy and stressful place to work. How not to let people treat you. Super bad management. Workplace culture some fun but stressful for everyone. Threatening employees jobs. Was the cash office
bad,Difficult place to work. Long hours with little pay. Store manager was great but managers above that level were overly demanding and never gave positive feedback. Tough to staff stores because of company's financial situation.
bad,I learned a lot when I first started. Its a good first job I suppose but after a while its best to find another place to work. The hours are horribly inconsistent and management isn't willing to work with you if you need to work 2 jobs.
bad,"You do not have phone access , no food , can't go on anything on the computer other than sears, managers constantly hounding agents and walking up and down the hall waiting for you to do something wrong. You can't get any days off the spanish people are so racist towards the black employees constantly talking spanish blatantly in front of everyones face avoiding taking sup calls"
bad,I worked and sears for three years and never had a raise never was promoted. They cross trained me only to have me do other people jobs and get paid less doing it. Also when a new manager was hired he fired everyone and brought in his own people.
bad,"This store is fast paced and high energy. The crowd changes form day to night, and you will be involved in both table serving and hosting parties that are set up by staff. There are, if I remember right, 28 signature drinks on top of the regular, well known drinks to the public. Food and drink menus are constantly changing, and the menus are very big. Fun to play games with the guests and a great culture over all as a company"
bad,Never had a chance to grow with the company. Paid $7.25 an hour and there were no chances of getting a raise. There was no way that you could make any type of living working there.
bad,management based on time served rather than knowledge. this lead to a lack of knowledge of products and warranty info regarding products. pay was low for work expected
bad,"Very poor atmosphere and culture to work in. Employees and management obviously did not want to be there. Employees were treated as if they are expendable, which reflected in the high turn-around rates. Misleading information during the interview process which focused on customer service but primary responsibilities were actually centered around making sales."
bad,Forced employees to shill out credit cards like candy to people who didn't want or need them. Even after a person had said no employees are required to push the card onto the customer. An employee was observed push a customer about the card to the point that a manager was called and then when the customer was dealt with and gone the employee was praised for her persistence
bad,I’m a people person. I love people- and my ideal work environment would be one filled with diverse and bright folks.I did not always see this at Sears
bad,"Noth worth working there. Managers there have their ""favorites"", you have to argue to get what you want from the company. The companies policies are so horrible that you are the front line to always have to argue with customers."
bad,"Sears is a company that learned from its CEO, everyone and everything is replaceable. Management does NOT work at all. Either in the office talking to each other or outside smoking by the front door. Management only wants results regardless if there are no customers. Managers will stand by register talking without helping cashiering when theres a line. If you call for one and by chance they actually answer you they will call to avoid actually having to come down to talk with customers."
bad,Poor management experience and no growth opportunities. Poor pay. No flexibility with hours. Horrible location. No pay raises at all and unfair policy.
bad,"I will never work at a retail store again especially this one, from favoritism, to lack of team support and lack of hours no thank you. Management is stressed and places anger-stress attitude on the hourly worker."
bad,"Shipping and receiving, restocking and clean up."
bad,"leads were primarily bad, high pressure sales techniques, management went out of there way to reduce commissions as much as possible, high turnover culture."
bad,Sears does not exist. This place will not exist in the next year. I do not believe this place is a thing anymore. Why would it? Well that is because Amazon is taking them out.
bad,do not work here plain and simply the management doesn't care about you whatsoever and they train very poorly. After being bad mouthed by this place after a recent job interview I just stopped showing up.
bad,"Sears could not care less about its employees. Credit cards are pushed on to customers and if a customer is having difficulty understanding that you are trying to sell them a credit card then it is encouraged to take advantage of that. This is the job I had while I was in high school at 16 and it gave me so much stress working there that I eventually had to quit. Also the management is awful, calling for assistance could take more than 15 minutes for a response and meanwhile you are left with an angry customer you cannot help. The return policy is garbage and if you work here you will have to be continuously yelled at for how awful it is."
bad,"Not a good place to work at all "
bad,"overall learned a lot about loading and unloading of trailers, developed some good skills, just found it to have been one of the dustiest and dirty place to work at."
bad,"the worse place to work here. Management is a joke.  Assistant manager who just came out of school with no prior knowledge of how to manage people, managing people.  Just a joke"
bad,"L'entreprise est maintenant fermée, cela ne sert donc à rien"
bad,If you’re looking for a job that’ll eventually upset you to the highest point of pistivity this job is for you. Store manager didn’t care about employees AT ALL.
bad,"While working at SEARS management was frustrating as the department manager would often tell you to do something one way, but the store manager would tell you differently. Management never seemed to be on the same page."
bad,"Lack of Advancement, Cutthroat environment. Lack of integrity and appalling antics, The Customer(Members) are treated unfairly, Employees are written up for bogus reasons to hinder career advancement."
bad,Regardless what subsidiary of Sears your working for. Still a dying company. Long Hours with no pay increase or incentive. Daily fire drills. Sears is no longer a corporation but a franchise
bad,closed do to poor management.  Sears travel is ok company to work for. High targets low walk in and head office not very supportive.  Wants you to work on your own time to market and not pay you for it.
bad,"You had to stand on your feet 8 hrs no break . you could not get full time.They never give you raises, management talks about everyone.Coworkers hatted what they did."
bad,"Overall management makes working at Sears stressful. Management does not care about it's staff & makes the job absolutely miserable  for anyone who voices concerns. The job itself is not horrible or horribly difficult but the managers make it so. In general the managers are vindictive and belittle employees, they do not inspire loyalty. After working for Sears I won't shop there, their treatment of employees makes it so you feel they deserve to close permanently.The managers have no consideration for anyone except themselves. DO NOT APPLY."
bad,"There was too much pressure oput on the emplotyees for credit apps. wven when a customer obviously didn't want the sears credit card, our job depended on getting a yes."
bad,most employees were unhappy with the manager at this location.  It was a chaotic office.  I did not like getting 2 hour shifts only to cover dinner time for employees.
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. Almost constantly short staffed, you often had to do much more work than one person should handle such as being the only one at a 4 register cash wrap."
bad,"I love people, loved the sales aspect, loved the inventory and the opportunity to sell jewelry to people, as well as manage a marvelous staff. Hardest part of the job is the process of Sears downsizing and ongoing Sears closings throughout the country and how that affects your ability to continue to positively promote the service and products."
bad,"When i first started it was a good job, but in due time the moral and overall job started declining. Management was terrible, the coworkers were great though"
bad,Worked technicians like dogs overbooked alot of driving miles that effect productivity that was never taken into consideration at the time of performance reviews
bad,This job will teach you how to be patient with a variety of consumers. Learning about the technologies within the apparel of sears is something that contributes to the overall satisfaction of the customers
bad,This store closed down since I worked there however; the positive during the christmas time it kept me busy.  However since I had a job that was only seasonal.
bad,A typical day at sears consisted of greeting customers and answering any questions that they had with our electronics. I would also restock our shelves and make sure everything looked nice and neat.
bad,Sears Home town are not owned by sears Corp. The owners of Sears  Hometown can be good if they are willing to work themselves. Make sure you have a good owner.
bad,Contact their HR I left a full review. Very unprofessional atmosphere. Would not recommend. They give all close selling leads to their veteran guys and give terrible leads to new employees with 2-3hr drive times. Commission only. Also borderline dangerous. Didn't stay long.
bad,My time working for this company was a test in attrition. Like with most retail jobs you are only put on schedule when needed. People spent more time brown nosing than actually working. The only positive was not working on weekends but only because of the merchandise delivery schedule.
bad,"I learned nothing"
bad,"I have been in management for over 30 years and have NEVER worked for a worse company. District management is no help and is always fearful of losing their jobs. The main focus (other than pushing appliances) is getting customers to sign up for credit cards. If there are issues with the sold product, it is almost impossible to provide a satisfactory solution for the customer. All of the customer resolution staff are outsourced overseas and communication for store employees as well as customers is very difficult. Ultimately, they are no help. Constant conference calls (as many as 5 a day) are simply a forum to beat up store management and repeated fire drills to address perceived issues in the stores. You are asked to work a minimum of 55 hours, but due to payroll cuts, you will be forced to work 60+ to cover departments with little or no available payroll hours. Hiring good employees is VERY difficult as the pay structure is minimum wage with no chance at giving raises. Sales associates are paid $4.50 hr. plus 1% commission. The commission is pulled back if the appliance is returned. This happens more than you would think. Most stores run 12-15% return rates. If you find a good candidate, they will leave when they realize they can do less work for more money almost anywhere else."
bad,"This is not a good place to work. The hours were inconsistent. The management was incompetent. Corporate was completely out of touch with the actual retail aspect of the store. The prices are so low that the store attracts the worst type of clientele. The policies do not protect the employees, and the turn-over rate is outrageous."
bad,A typical day consist of ringing peoples merchandise up or giving refunds. I learn that the management was not helpful. I enjoyed working with people and helping the customer.
bad,i have nothing to say about a business that is no longer open. it was just decent experience for customer service and having a job in general. this was pointless
bad,"My experience was short-lived, I moved to another province but the most part was creating friendships. "
bad,i didnt like working here. the staff was rude and always gossiping about store closings. days would go by with no one walking through my department.so sad.
bad,Worked for Sears for 10 years prior to the buy out. The team was not encouraged to work together. They were pitted against one another. Hours were long and pay was low. Not many opportunities for advancement.
bad,this company may have been a great place to work at in its prime. however. the way that they treat their employees and other business practices make it a very difficult place to work at.
bad,Was really bad and going out of business i wouldn't apply unless you had no other choice. There are no more full time employee positions every position is part time. You never make 40hrs a week much less maintain 30. Benefits are expensive for no reason. Managers are over worked and stressed out and often take out there frustrations on employees.
bad,"N/A"
bad,Sears as a whole is a dying company. They keep closing stores and I think the company will be gone by the end of next year. ..........................
bad,Sears is an organized company and the workers there are very nice it was just the pay wasn't good enough for me to have to drive fron bastrop to monroe everyday for a little of nothing and i had to stop because i was not satisfied.
bad,Poor job placement and unstable work environment. No direction or communication between employees and management. Bad work schedule and just not flexible.
bad,"Management is horrible at this place.  Cut throat environment.  No new merchandise to sell, only old stock from previous years.  Long hours, low pay, lazy managers who push their responsibilities off of the Leads (Department Managers).  You work weeknights, weekends, and every holiday.  This job will cause stress, destroy family and social life, and leave you working alot of hours for very very low pay."
bad,"Having worked here for years, the holiday season was the worst. All they cared about was making money and did not care how they treated their employees."
bad,"Sears used to be the place to work, good salary, great benefits, stock options, but as time went on and the internet is taking over, more and more brick and mortar companies are falling by the waste side.  I saw the writing on the wall years ago and decided to move on."
bad,worked as a credit analyst authorizer. The people were good however the system needed improvement. Minorities were judged on a separate rating system which is ultimately why i left.
bad,"Overall, its a job that pays and is not meant for sustainability. Management were poorly selected and corporate are no better, it would always be stressful during the days they would come to pay visit."
bad,"Sears has to decide whether they're going out of business.  If they're staying open, they need to fix all the falling apart cash registers, display hardware and cabinet lighting.  The managers need training.  The turnover of new emmplyees is very migh. The temperature of the building is kept very warm to save money.  In the winter, there is no airflow and in summer the place is a sweat box.  The customers complain about the heat and leave. There is no water fountain for customers to use and the customer bathrooms are not serviced often enough. There are times when all of the upper management is gone at the same time and there isn't even someone too give change for the register or authorize a transaction which needs approval.  Lay-offs have occurred in key positions and there are no longer enough empoyees on board to keep the store running.."
bad,"Sears was a great company to work for at first, very welcoming, friendly environment. They were many during the holidays but after January was when things went downhill, new management was terrible and unfair, working environment was dangerous, if you were lucky you'll get to work one day out of the week. horrible work place."
bad,"The company is failing and now just tossing things in the air and hoping it works. Management is the other killer of the company without the knowledge of retail operations. Advancement is impossible, no raises ever. Sears is just an revolving door for employees"
bad,don't work here it's super stressful and very tideous. In the store however the Auto center was great and efficient on timely manners for the customer's experience
bad,"Company lacks direction, little room for advancement, probably won't be in business for long. The company has no benefits, and the treatment of its people leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,Extremely high turn over rate.  I saw THREE people get fired in just one day in the same department.  Having job fairs to hire new people but yet they are sending people home early (mandantory). I worked 40 hours in two weeks and I'm full time.  You can never get a day off when you want and you don't start accruing any vacation time until after you've been with the company for a year.
bad,"Doing the job of more than three people. If you had questions, no one could answer them because no one was knowledgeable in jewelry. Never approved for a raise because Sears is bankrupt. Manager called me over the phone to tell me I was out of a job; very unprofessional."
bad,"My store manager will lie about any changes that are coming, and will do nothing when presented with a problem. The technicians are over worked and the compensation does not meet or exceed expectations."
bad,Sears is no longer around it closed it doors January 14 2018.Many years ago it was a good place to work. But you could see it changing over the years.It is a shame
bad,They is loosing so Much money don't do it. Its only a matter of time before they file bankruptcy. They continue to layoff more and more people. They close down stores all the time its just a matter of time before they close down the doors for good
bad,the store I worked at is no longer in business. But when I worked there it was fun but the pay was no good. No room for advancements because the company has no money
bad,"Terrible hours, the store is almost always empty, it's boring, there's hardly ever anything to do, there's a lot of sitting around, and you get an employee discount card that doesn't even give you an employee discount. It's just if you were to move up and become a manager to override things which never happens at Sears."
bad,"The job was fine, but due to the mismanagement of the company by supervisors (at all levels) and shareholder greed, they are no longer a viable company"
bad,close to home work location.  But as Sears went under via court findings or took the Usa way out and did not look into the best interest of the Canadian people who worked for them. All employees
bad,"I hated every minune working with sears, everyone was mean or rude.  Especilaaly the customers.  The only saving grace was how close it was to my house"
bad,"Every day is the same at sears. You sit in a chair dialing out to customers to schedual a appt. with them. Honestly their really isnt much to learn but typing on the computer. The hardest part of the job is pay and lack of management.Every day is something , The pay changes everyday. so many people leave the job. Their Bonus structure always changes , its never the same."
bad,It was chaotic and nothing was ever organized. Management was never happy with anything. People didn't progress through the company or get raises. They're having financial problems.
bad,Working for the management at Sears when I was employed was extremely frustrating. Being partial to particular employees was often a daily habit. I would not recommend.
bad,"Was loyal to Sears for almost ten years working full time, under staffed, stayed over to clean before visits from corporate, management is clueless. Sears isn't loyal to it's associates you work one day and the next they have restructured and your position is terminated period. Don't work for this company ever!"
bad,I was told I was no longer employed with Sears over the phone on my day off by someone I had never met after 22 years.  That is not how you treat your employees
bad,I hated this job more than any job I ever had in my life I would rather cut off a body part and chew on it rather working for this garbage p shoot company i
bad,"the job started out fine but became more difficult due to the manager and my supervisor. The department I worked in ,I gained a lot more experience and knowledge, the hours were not steady so I quit."
bad,"no one makes very much money, their benefits are really non exitent, your schedule changes on a moment's notice and my district manager routinely yelled at my entire staff like we were being hazed in a fraternity"
bad,"It's a joke, most of the good employees leave after they see how management works. They expect to much and no praise just money making no matter if you lie. Just get the sale."
bad,"Management is not supportive. Staff is consistently overworked, forced to do others' jobs for no pay. Locked in the building, yelled at in front of customers. Poor business practices.Constantly taking money away from the workers, the store is on it's way to close."
bad,management is the worst... don't care about customer just want their money and will lie to get it... so glad I'm not there any more... if you have morals don't work for this company... it's a BIG joke!!!
bad,"I work very  hard on a daily bases.  Right now there is to much uncertain within the company .  The over all structure to me needs to change, I think if a company is to grow it needs to listen to its employees some time. The average starting pay is totally unfair to base on the other stores."
bad,"If you decide to work at sears do yourself a favor and look another job. It's very unorganized and unrealistic. No one in management know what their doing. A key phrase they like to spit out is ""we're just spit balling ideas"" when it comes time to organize the backroom for future supply truck there's no room. Every project present to us by management seem like it was thought up with no vision. Also information that should be important is not told clearly. In the end it seem like a waste of time."
bad,"Most days if felt like we all were running around with no idea what was going on. Managers spent most time walking around or in the back. Alot of work, and very little incentives, or recognition."
bad,"Not enough leads, always taking money out of your paychecks, lot of travelling using your own transportation minimal coverage. only commission based. so no paid vacation or anything."
bad,I worked here for a week when they tell you about they don't tell you you are only going to get paid 6.50 per hour. They tell you you will be making 14 an hour that is a lie
bad,"Terrible place to work. I don't enjoy the atmosphere, customers are always angry. Co workers are frustrated with the company as well as current managers. I can't wait to get out."
bad,"I hate it,,, the employees are all liars & big hypocrites.  The pay is terrible.  Expect alot but pays so little. I hate it there but it will have to do for now til I get another better paying, benefit giving job"
bad,A company that will eliminate your job from under after eating crow for three years to appease them. Do not work for sears or its K-Mart affiliates. You will not be compensated for your effort you will consistently be overworked and then they will decide to no longer need your job in the company. This is a terrible company and I look forward to its closing for the sake of those unfortunate enough to still be employed there.
bad,Most all of the stores are closing due to performance. The company does not want to make the changes needed to make the stores successful. Kmart and Sears are both a part of the Culture of our country and it is sad to see them shut down. Changes could be made to turn around the company.
bad,During my short time at this company I experienced friendships but also poor management. The stress put on management trickled down to employees which often caused reason for unhappy staff.
bad,You could tell the company wasn't going down when they started pulling things out losing vendors inside the store along with some of their long time standing employees retiring and getting no benefits for that retirement
bad,"never got anywhere with them, could never do anything right when it came to work. never got breakes on time or somthings at all, no sick days always, said that i was last when i never was"
bad,Back to back calls. Company is garbage and not making any money. It Sears so there is not much to talk about company will be gone by 2030. They did it to themselves its not 1956 anymore...
bad,"75 hr weeks , ripped off at leasr 15k worth of pay per year.....crooks! Train you to lie and steal from customers fraud desperate cheap company drive 1000 miles per week even steal from paid miles"
bad,"You really couldn't plan anything because schedules changed weekly and often weren't posted until Thursday, Friday, or sometimes Saturday. The new schedule started on Sunday. Management did not support associates and they encouraged devious sales tactics."
bad,"Étant donné que je m'occupais de mes parents en fin de vie, j'ai pris cet emploi pour sortir un peu de chez moi mais j'adorais le service à la clientèle,tâches diversifiées, je n'arrêtais jamais. C'est ce que j'aime, le personnel était très gentil, les patrons aussi mais le salaire médiocre."
bad,"not willing to work with schedules, minimal pay, incentives are minimal as well. only recommended as part time job or a stepping stone to something else"
bad,"they don't look out for there employee's , they don't care if there is a crisis with family or not, they reprimand you when you have an emergency and can't come in"
bad,The company is falling apart. Stores are closing left and right and as a result there is very little chances for advancement. While I worked there (over a year) all non-management and non-commissioned employees were not allowed to get raises ever.
bad,No good working here sears is going down. They are scratching in who ever they can for upper management and they are not doing a good job keeping to there word for regular associates doing the bait and switch
bad,"This is a company that really has no care for their employees, they also leave no room for advancement only movement between departments. Would no recommend outside of a first job kind of experience."
bad,was just not a good working place did have good insurance and other than that most the employee acted if the were in the wild west only stayed for the insurance
bad,The culture is one of gloom and doom.  You are constantly looking over your shoulder.  We were closing stores monthly.  Associates feared for their jobs.
bad,"Im not sure all sears operate this way, but this one set the ""never work for again"" taste on my tongue. Employees stole money from drawers. Other employees would steal ticks from other associates to get the pay. Manager never showed up to work and let the lead sales make the schedule. giving him ad his friend all the hours."
bad,"Will not review Sears. It is far not fair to the company it once was. My time there was a learning experience of a declining iconic retailer that was a epic disappointing experience.. While I adored my team, and my location, and career, the unfortunate ending was that of a decline in higher paid staffing."
bad,"Hated working here. They didn’t care about the associates, just the ones that got good credit numbers. if you didn’t, they’d write you up . Management obviously favors the person who brings in the most credit ."
bad,"This Sears was closed down years later after I left. Everyday was just another day of someone treating me like an idiot because I was always learning something new about tools and lawn/garden products. "
bad,"Believe me, this is the last place you want to work. There is no help by management, you do what you can to get the job done. Very unorganized, the employees rarely work together to accomplish anything."
bad,"I came into the store when the manager was feuding with a couple of employees, then she went on maternity leave. so the manager who took over while she left, trained me completely wrong and quit along with the other team members who didn't like the other manager. that left myself(new girl) and another co-worker working 50+ hours while being 6 months pregnant. they had me traveling to naples during that time."
bad,A typical day consisted of going to a meeting with the Management staff that was intended to be a pep rally. It was 15 minutes of nonsense while they attempted to glorify achievements and still press you to make quotas. People at checkout and sales staff were expected to have a set number of shop your way rewards sign ups per day and credit card applications filed. Support staff were to have surveys filled out as well.
bad,The worst company Ive ever worked for. Sears did not offer any benefits for the owners of their franchises. Sears used the owners for their profit and offered very little profit margins for store owners.
bad,Management phases me out by not scheduling me and remain an active employee.  Wrong doing on their part.  No one should be treated this way.  No write up's on my part or wrong doing.
bad,"Nobody cared since the stores were dropping like flies. No raises, no advancement, low wages, unrealistic goals. Horrible and I gave them 10 years . The only reason I stayed so long was I loved my coworkers. When they started to leave with stores going out it was time. HARD TO BELIEVE ANY STORES ARE STILL OPEN!"
bad,The management at the Fort Wayne store was atrocious. They treated employees like trash and expected them to give 100% when  they did nothing. Unreal expectations for a dying company.
bad,This is a terrible place to work. They have unrealistic expectations for workers and are very unprofessional. I would never recommend this job to anyone
bad,Retail is no fun at all. You have to greet every customer and if you do not you get in trouble. There is always missing stock and a lot of the people there did not take it seriously.
bad,they didn't teach me anything the first day i work the manager just told me to go in a certain section and fold clothing. she never thought me how to fold it or how it was posted to go.
bad,All ABout MOney. If you dont perform they are constantly on you.  Have  a point system that makes it impossible to have a life.  Would not recommend if you have kids wife or any other reponsibility.
bad,"It was a very nepotistic company where if you did not know anyone, you would not move up. Most people that were in the management area were family members and even if you had the credentials, it was hard to move up."
bad,Sears cannot figure out how to save itself so it does so by punishing the employees by taking away benefits and getting rid of raises/bonuses while always tempting you by saying there are bonuses if you work this hard next month.
bad,Everything about the sear’s in Wilmington sucked. Don’t work here!!!!! They are have since of respect for the customers or employees just don’t do it at all.
bad,Bad place to work. Low pay and lack of advancement opportunity. The management was terrible and was run inefficiently. I would not recommend working there.
bad,"It sucks. I worked full time hours, but never got full time benefits. The management was HORRIBLE! The only really good thing about the job were my coworkers."
bad,"If you want to lose your soul, go work at the dying behemoth that is Sears. Bad management, bad computer systems, worthless membership program. Bad products."
bad,"The store manager was horriable, she was out to get me. They wouldn't allow you to talk to other associates, they wacthed you from the camera room. they also slashed your hours when it was not even your fault."
bad,"Have been there for over three years. Excellent reviews, they do not and have never given pay raises. Was hired as a  sales consultant, and they took away commission from us permanently about 9 months ago. Sears is in a downhill spiral, but Corporate doesn't seem to care. In the last three years have seen numerous Corporate Employees let go. Corporate has not reinvested money into the stores, thus resulting in old, outdated and poorly running cash registers, CTT's and computers. Many of the employees that were there when I started have either left for better pay or were just fed up with how they were treated by Management.  Customers are short of patience due to lack of employees to cash them out."
bad,"hard manual labor,pushing large carts loaded with merchandise onto sales floor. place merchandise on racks and or shelves."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working here to anyone unless you absolutely need a job. The store was constantly filthy, management was weak, and pre negotiated schedules were treated like suggestions rather than your available hours."
bad,"Sears does not offer a good environment to work at. They don't treat the employees with respect. Too many bosses, One tell you thing, and the other tell you something else."
bad,Managers lacked want or enthusiasm to help associates or customers. If there was an issue I was told to say I was the manager to avoid bothering my manager.
bad,"When I worked for corporate store, it was an excellent company to work for, Good pay and benefits. Now working for hometown store it has nothing to offer except low pay and bad hours,"
bad,"Sears is nasty place to work."
bad,Management has changed over the years and it shows. They require you to make unimaginable quotas and misinform customers. They do not honor bonuses if you do not keep even when your numbers are good.
bad,"excellent customer service, to handling the critical transaction. satisfaction of the customer received lots of positive customer survey multiple credit application."
bad,Highly competitive group of people that have found a way to channel their energies into driving success for the whole team. Everyone is hungry and you feel as if you are a part of something much larger than yourself.
bad,"Sears wasn't such a great job. The equipment that we had to use was usually messed up. I did get hurt working with sears once. The location I was working at, had tones of issues."
bad,"They will use you and never consider acknowledging your worth."
bad,"Poor management, poor compensation, poor work environment, poor coworkers. it seems really that the only good thing about this place is it is more than likely closing. I have personally heard the appliances manager lie to customers, and the store manager is so confrontational and rude to customers that getting him involved is a sure fire way to lose a sale. Impossible to achieve metrics, with no customer base, and you are forced to try to rope customers into paying extra for a warranty, that in all honesty, is a 100 percent scam. you are punished for not signing customers up for the bad credit card that they offer in store, you really have to do some very immoral, borderline criminal things if you work at the Wasilla store."
bad,"This was probably the worst job ever. Typical day included cleaning up after messy co-workers that were there before your shift. Also, standing around because there was literally nothing to do because the store was so dead. Managers only cared about if you sold credit cards or not and if you didn't, don't expect to get many hours. The hardest part was probably dealing with customers who wanted even more of a discount than they already had. The most enjoyable part was meeting the other co-workers that agreed that it was a terrible place to work."
bad,"you do this for me, I do something for you and own you. in other words you could never not be in debt with them. mangers sleeping with employees. being mentally abused and  physically pushed by my manger."
bad,Paid was not great! I would love to have the opportunity to advanced with the company but it seems like a dead end. I think Sears is just going into a hole.
bad,"at sears i started in December and you have no benefits for part time, but only if you work 30 hour or more. no discounts, bad security bad management"
bad,Horrible place to work don’t apply management is horrible Human Resources is horrible low pay and you do everything just horrible always pressured and never tecognozed
bad,"Sears was a terrible place to work mainly because the company was already in freefall even way back then, and demanded employees sell as many rip-off maintenance agreements and extended warranties as possible. Don't work for Sears."
bad,"worst place to work, the coworkers are great, but the top management is terrible starting with the CEO, sears is destroy because of them. the CEO is a fool i think a monkey could do a better job running a company. I loved sears but it seems that everyone in the corporate office wants to destroy it."
bad,It was horrible. The management was incompetent at the best of times and the pay was lousy. When working sails commissions were cut to half a present.
bad,I did not like the lack of hours that was given per week. There were too many office associates for the job where the time had to be split multiple days. Was not able to work nowhere else in the store to get hours.
bad,its an ok place to start off an automotive career. you will learn the basics and if they have at least one good upper level technician you might learn a little more.
bad,Sears was a nice place to work when I started with nice people to work with. But as the years went on and the CEO's changed to was clear the company was moving in the wrong direction. They would step over dollars to pick up pennies and that is know way to run a business.
bad,"Make on average minimum wage.  Other co-workers shady.  Stressful, especially holidays.  No benefits.  Can't trust manager or DM.  High turn over.  Don't miss it."
bad,Company is losing buisiness because of the way they treat customers and associates. They are letting people go and having associates do there workbplus there own. They are constantly taking pay away from associates bevause of less customers. If anything goes wrong it is akways associates fault. Culture and moral is the worst. And you dont want to say anything or you will get punished.
bad,"Expected you to do - but not rewarded for what you do, cut throat, stressful place!  Would not ever work there again and  would not recommend anyone work there!"
bad,This company will be bankrupt in a year. Don't apply. They are over extended and almost out of mone. Closures continue. Selling off brands and ending relationships.
bad,Again you would need to work there in order to get a feel for how something is. No one can tell you how it is really until you work there you must find these things our for yourself.
bad,because of mismanagement the whole chain of stores has been now closed not much else to be said. feel sorry for the long time employees that have lost so much
bad,This place is not a very friendly place to work at if your over the age of 30. Most of the kids get that work there get away with  everything. Would never recommend this place.
bad,"Where to begin, the management was absolutely terrible, harassing customers   and workers. Absolutely no  off time. Not many workers will come and help if the lines get too long."
bad,"Managers were micromanaging very heavily for credits every day. even on slow days, you would get sent home if you do not make the required amount of credit card applications.Getting a member to apply for the credit card involves harassing them for it, you have to ask them multiple times throughout the transaction and sometimes they get angry. You don't get proper training either, the managers were very lazy and talk to you however they want, they'll also give you fewer hours if you don't make enough credits. the job pays $10 an hour with $2 commission for every credit card application.  One of the worst things about working at Sears was my schedule, it was very inconsistent and it was impossible to schedule your life around. it changed every week. One other thing is that you get sent an employee discount card in the mail but you are unable to use it because the company does not do employee discounts... why send the card? Sears is going in the direction its meant to go IMHO. The company does not value employees or customers."
bad,"company in trouble, poor benefits, low pay, high churn of managers, bad work environment, negative customers always asking questions about media and press articles, lack of direction, information."
bad,"difficult to work when you do not trust your supervisor, sending you to multiple locations to cover at the same time.  Low pay and no advancement and no benefits"
bad,"This place was horrible. Management sucks, they cannot answer customer questions they come over and approve just about anything without thoroughly reviewing. In the jewelry and behind cashier wraps there are small bugs because they dont clean well. In the winter the heat doesnt work well and in the summer the air is barely on. Those so called managers only want you to do is get credit card applications, thats all they care about and security is totally pathetic, useless and  incompetent!!!!!"
bad,"fast pace, have to get credit cards applications everyday. Customer are priority always convince them into getting the credit card and giving them money off the purchase."
bad,"Management was terrible, pay sucks and there's no benefits. They require you to scam people into getting store credit cards. They don't care about customer satisfaction."
bad,"Horrible, they will pay you $7.25 Hr. And tell you you’re going to start off at $8.00.  Slow store sales. Hard on credit apps that’s what keeps the store open honestly. Employee Discount is shop your way rewards no percentage off your purchases."
bad,The management at this company is not up to par it needs to be replenished the workers here or not treated with any type of respect we work very hard long hours with close to no break at all if possible I would not recommend Anyone working at this job
bad,Never sure from day to day what is expected of the technician to do. Currently hiring technicians who are not capable of repairing anything but can sell add on junk to customer taking advantage of customer trust
bad,"Don't waste your time,  the company will probably be bankrupt within six months. The CEO is a brilliant property manager who is simply managing Sear's decline. All he cares about is protecting his investments in Sears Holding."
bad,"The CEO of the company came to visit our store just before my last holiday with the company. I went to shake his hand and he fist bumped me. I appreciate what he was trying to do and make himself seem like one of the guys but I felt that he didn't respect any of us enough as people to shake my hand like a man."
bad,Stress filled work environment that took advantage of younger people trying to make pocket money and those who desperately needed a job alike. Absolutely not worth the effort they bully you in to.
bad,"Sears is more like High School not a Career "
bad,miserable unhappy unprofessional disorganized demoralizing pathetic hopeless deliberately sabotaged by the  evil CEO who is strip mining the company for its assets
bad,"Unfortunately, the fate of the company was written on the wall.  Since the time I started there, is was in difficulty......it did not have a chance no matter how hard you worked or how loyal you were."
bad,Need more time to complete projects according to standards. Only get extra hours for Christmas. Over worked and under paid. Do not pay well. Flexible for hours is according to the needs of the company not the employee.
bad,I worked as both a service writer and a sale rep.  The customers half the time never understood what we were selling.  Also they paid you on commision.
bad,"aside from getting sales and customer service experience, this was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. The managers would not work with you, pay was terrible, and the hours were terrible."
bad,"I would never recommend someone work there. The hours was very little, the pay was even lower and all they cared about was getting everyone to sign up for a credit card."
bad,"its really slow, managers don't really care about your needs and you are underpaid and will never give you a raise. that's why nobody really lasts working here"
bad,El ambiente de trabajo malo en sucursal Mazatlán desde gerencia mala comunicación y muy malas desusii es Terán a los empleados de ratero y te hacen pagar hasta lo que sw roba los clientes te vigilan hasta cuándo van al baño y  no tienen nada de humanidad ante los empleados .
bad,"Worst job I have ever had.  If you want to stressed out, over worked and underpaid...  then it is the job for you.  Health benefits are too expensive, every process is micromanaged, and they don't pay for anything.  you have to put up with it for a year before you even get vacation.  I think monkeys run it."
bad,"Sear is good only for over time. Now, if you are lucky, barely 40 hrs a week.. No benefits other than a pay vacation after you hit your 2nd year. Sear does offer health benefits but the cost is more. As far as getting a raise, there have been none in 8 years."
bad,I worked at sears once and it was the most horrible job ever in my life. The managers were all so rude and annoying and sometimes they force you to stay over time.
bad,"hours are very inconsistent, get sent home when it is slow, it is quite frequently slow! management was stealing money from the shop, no one is left in the shop that knows what they are doing after i quit."
bad,The company does not focus on employees....they would rather fire seasoned employees so that they can hire new ones so they can pay them less.  The benefits are horrible as well.  And no raises.
bad,I would never work at sears again... it was very boring.. I barley got breaks.. the pay was way to low.. I was on my feet all day during my shift.. I wouldn't recommend this job to a friend.
bad,"This is what happens when you have a hedge fund lunatic take over an iconic retailer. Poor management, poor delivery, very bad service, many customer problems."
bad,Sears Canada is closing and twelve thousand people will be loosing their jobs without any severance and even after multiple years of service we all walk away with nothing
bad,"Sears Holdings Corporation has no job stability and longevity right now. Think about it before you accept a job offer. The company is going down and laying off employees left and right. Do not make the same mistake I did and accept an offer out of desperation, you will have to find another job within the first month because you will not like it there, trust me."
bad,"sold service agreements for appliances which was very expensive,management kept changing and so did our compensation of sales after awhile it was difficult to reach quota"
bad,"If you want to work for free while providing excellent customer service then this is the place to be"
bad,"It's down the drain now as it was a foreseen tragedy leading by the CEO. Plans are implemented poorly by the management to cause the 12,000 employees unemployed and whoever the business was involved with them."
bad,This job pays $7. 25/hr and its 2017. They do not communicate and they do things behind your back. They are bullies and do not know how to handle business. Neither does corporates. Disgusting place to work.
bad,This job was horrible. If you were not in the click of people you have no chance of advancements. There is no support to help you succeed in your position. This is not a place I would suggest anyone to work at.
bad,"Not a good company to work for at this time. Sears time has passed with their lack of advancement in the new world of retail. Unfortunately with a declining customer base the company is in trouble. Most items are on the Internet which prevents a lot of customers from buying since most are older and don't use computers. "
bad,I was sexually harrast by a co-worker and my managers didn't do anything about it. I told my managers not to let me work with him but they did anyways.
bad,It was the most stressful job ever but i did learn important task while working there. My patience and people's skills were built at that company. Hardest part of the job was not having training.
bad,A typical day at work started with a morning meeting on the daily goals followed by small conversation amongst the mixed crowd of employees as we prep our  workstations for the customers. Knowledge of our sale items both 1st and 3rd party products was always important so you would find some employees at this time going over sale points for some of the items. Upon opening there would be a subtle race to acquire as many sales as possible in order to pad your check and this led to several issues. Salary workers wouldn't work as hard as the commission employees and commission employees would be upset if there hard labor amounted to less then anticipated based on the income per item. This generally created a uniquely hostile environment and indeed a definite learning experience as management did nothing to fix any of those issues and soon after that particular branch of a historical company was closed. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply giving the customer exactly what they were looking for and sometimes something better. Then worst thing about the job was the lack of team effort in anything. It seemed that employees would have performed efficiently if they management considered the staff issues seriously.
bad,The new manager has a very negative outlook on everything in the store including her employees. The reason I left was because she lowered my morale through various team lectures and her severe negativity. It wasn't her job to make schedules as well so she can have her hand in everyone. Her rallies consisted of how we are as workers and most of her views on us were awful. She yells at customers as well as employees through the intercom through various rants. Our hours get cut as well for some people not being scheduled for weeks on end. While us employees would work like ants and still get shunned upon. My supervisors and my co workers were a pleasure to work with and I wish them well in everything. I would recommend to stay away from Sears Jersey City as much as you can.
bad,"Worst place ever to work at. no money , no traffic, oblivious management.   if you want a job where you work by yourself and have no customers then this would be the job for you."
bad,You become a con-artist and manipulate the customers or else your job is in danger even if you have thousand dollar sells doesn't matter to the management. The worst job I have.
bad,"Underpaid job, where too much is expected for little pay. Poor managers with no management training. Morale is brought down every morning prior to shift, and there isn't enough foot traffic for consultative sales to make commission."
bad,"store closed was a decent place to work and had a lot of fun dealing with customers. sometimes going out of way to please customers, fun time during holidays"
bad,My coworkers were a mixed batch but the management was completely out of touch. Everybody was so stressed all the time for seemingly no reason. I would never work here again.
bad,As a supervisor i felt like an associate. The workload was too much for one person to handle. I had training i never finished cause my manager wouldn't give me the time.
bad,"Appointments at customer home to display flooring. Measured the floor space and applied cost by computer to the customer selections, "
bad,Poor corporate structure. CEO has no pulse on current retail trends. Constant reduction of processes and procedures. High turnover rate in upper and middle management
bad,They make you ask 3 times in a transaction if someone wants credit cards and the managers are either not around when need them or just not helpful.  The managers had were inappropriate
bad,Crazy part I loved working at Sears no lie. It was a great place to work until they took away commission brought in people who had no idea of how to run a company. Moved the best managers that the former store I use to work at away. Brought in managers who never managed a store before. Company constantly going bankrupt and had a manager come and clean house. The pay was awesome (at one point). You had time to spend with your fam.
bad,"I had a terrible experience while working it.  The call center was very dated and caused a lot of health problems.  It was shut down several times due to contaminated water, plumbing concerns, leaking pipes, and power outages.  My manager never offered any feedback so I never knew how I was performing.  The culture was very depressing and unprofessional.  I could go on and on about this location.  I am suprised that they are still open."
bad,"This company has become far too complacent over the years.  They have not updated Point of sales systems, or market strategies and it is because the continue to hire outside people into their executive management.  These people do not care about the longevity of the company.  They used to be an American name, but have become more of a third party distributor.  This company will most likely fail."
bad,"unhealthy environment, cut throat, commission pay, no care for fellow employees, over worked under paid, bad area, falling apart, bad service, no dedication"
bad,Worst Place to work ! The managers in there takes avange of there workers especially their good workers they have no respect for you what's so ever!!!
bad,No thanks to this job doesn't get treated fairly if you don't sell a certain amount of credit cards they cut your hours shows favoritism was very pleasant.
bad,"The Sears that I worked at was a mess from the management all the way down to my position. If you asked for less hours because of school, they wouldn't give that to you because they were low on workers. The job environment also wasn't the best."
bad,"Rude co-workers, managers treated workers poorly, inconsistent schedules. There was poor communication from Management to Cashiers. I felt very stressed at work and hated every moment."
bad,"Management here was very poor, employees were not treated well. I had multiple employees quit during my short time of working here, I was never scheduled to work in one spot and was constantly changing locations,"
bad,I will say that some of the managers are not all bad but for the most part if you are not in their circle you get no respect at all no matter how hard you work.
bad,Content I do not work there. Overworked and not enough pay. SEARS is going out of business and there is no advancement. Management does not know what they are doing 100% of the time.
bad,Some employees were helpful and nice. Enjoyed helping customers. Like working in the morning before store opens. We received discounts. Some Supervisors weren't helpful.
bad,This was the job title I help before my current title. I leaned the basic management duties to provide the best customer service per SHC . The culture at the time was much better then it was to date . The hardest part about the job was the inconsistency of the management .
bad,Horrible benefits for the amount of employees.  Management is not helpful.  They do not like to give out two days off in a row.  You have to know someone to get anywhere in the company.
bad,"As someone who starred out as a cashier then moved to hardlines, I got to see the store from two different points of view. It was not so much the customers but upper management. They looked down on you as though you were pawns in their game, and you had no say in the matter. to go against them was a one way ticket to losing your job. The inner circle they have created between themselves held numerous secrets and foul play. For example the assistant store manager was having relations with the loss prevention manager, too powerhouses that should never be trifled with, and when a question of concern was brought to the store manager he simply brushed it letting us know that he knew of the issue. Once again out of personal example when I found the two in a dark room together I was verbally assaulted and told if and I quote ""Listen you f**king didn't see anything we weren't here"" and at the time I was mortified having told no one except a close friend I kept quiet. But now that I left and the assistant store manager is on her way to being promoted I felt as though I should voice my opinion. Not only should she not be promoted but fired."
bad,Understaffed and Poorly managed created a toxic work environment and with the constant threat of closure it was a difficult company to work for as it goes under.
bad,"Didnt like the job"
bad,worked over 50 hours was told to work until I hit 50 but the amount of calls you got you could never finish them  had to call customers and tell them our self that we couldn't make our appointments that they scheduled  lame excuse for a company `and was forced to sell repair insurance policy or you were terminated never work there again
bad,Everyone started jumping ship 10 years ago.  They have been taking commissions down for a long time.  Employee's are not happy and always worried when the end is.
bad,"I was a very stressful job, I didn't enjoy working there they over worked you for the amount of money you were paid, the staff was ok but not worth the pay"
bad,"sears was a horrible place to work. The company is failing, also they don't focus on the employees or customers. Management across the board are not trained probably. They throw you out on the floor without cross training you for different departments."
bad,The worst place to work. Unorganized and no benefits what so ever.I spent three years at this place and got no benefits and no discount. Stay away!!!!
bad,"In over thirty years in being in business, this was the worst run company that I have been a part of.  I guess that is why they are closing stores at a rate of which they will be gone in five years."
bad,"nothing at all positive to say, well, except a number of the people I worked with were good people. The place just didn't function in a way that made much business sense and it continues to be reflected at this point in time."
bad,"Poor management large over turn of staff."
bad,"Sears is a failing company for a reason..."
bad,bad management would never recommend this job for anyone. random schedule bad communication very unprofessional place to work and i would never return
bad,Work encounter wasn't good. Manager we're horrible. They don't really train you. They tell you about all the hours you will get. It's not true. They should close.
bad,"This place sucks to work at "
bad,They have certain managers and employee who are allowed to do whatever they want whenever they want and there are no consequences to there actions. If you speak up about it then you are targeted by the people.
bad,"Poor work environment, long harsh hours, long drives, low pay, management sucks, trucks are old, equipment is old, employees get drunk, most don't know what they're doing, customers always complain"
bad,"It took forever for me to start, and once I started it was hard to get hours. Most hours I worked were because someone called in. The management was not great."
bad,They really don't care bout their employees. You can be there all day have no sales and get yelled at because you made no money. You don't get trained properly and then they expect you to know everything and do everything right. you have no room for advancement.
bad,I was hired on at Sears Automotive and was made to deal with a lewd manager who was constantly sexually harassing me. I was given less hours due to a now former employee's demanding more hours so I gave my two weeks and quit. It was a very stressful place to be stuck at.
bad,"If you value your time and energy, look elsewhere. Sears was a horrible place to work in a building that was seriously outdated (No working air conditioning upstairs is one thing, but lack of airflow made working unbearable in the summer months, maintenance was also poor) and a company out of touch with 'today'. "
bad,Sears sucks the management sucks the labor sucks I would never recommend ANYONE EVER to work there after what they put me through with those Sears credit cards that was out rageous how can you put this pressure on these kids like that and ask them to produce it makes no sense at all.
bad,No raises for employees and benefits are to expensive. It's closing stores and wanting employees to do more and corporate took away employees discounts.theres no job security and store managers don't care about employees they looked at them as bodies. I worked there for 3 years and every year am told by management it will get better well it didn't it got worse. I won't recommend anyone to work for sears you will regret it.
bad,"management forces commission based employees to do labor, thereby missing sales and essentially working for free. there are no benefits. no set schedule. treats customers and employees very poorly. management does not want to help you in anyway. the company is on its way out, so everyone still working for sears, including management is just riding it out"
bad,I worked in two different stores with two different vibes. The team you work with and on makes all the difference. Some great DMs some not so great. Find consistency and advocate for your teams as much as possible. Give them the tools to provide good customer service.
bad,"I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with remotely, but the local culture was toxic. The vast majority of upper management was  unimaginative and pedantic, openly discounting any new ideas other than those from their inner circle, even if they had been field tested. I would not recommend anyone get involved with this organization."
bad,Management is often combative about time off. No one in the company has had a raise in over 5 years. Employee's often seem miserable at their jobs and the atmosphere is depressing.
bad,The training they give you is very very poor. The managers are very rude and extremely unhelpful and dont do anything at all that pertains to their job or anything in that manner. The pay is bare minimum and they lie about you making extra money when taking a lead or opening a credit card. If a mistake happens they blame you even though they dont even train you. Dont work here the managers here are terrible.
bad,I worked in the portrait studio that went bankrupt while i was employed for them. I cant review sears the store its self as i didnt work for them directly.
bad,"They made it difficult to plan your life outside of Sears. You are lucky to get the schedule maybe 3 days before you work. The schedule will be for one week ONLY. Instead of 2 weeks in advance like most companies. They will call or text you almost every day to come in and interrupt whatever life your trying to have. Instead of just putting you on the schedule to begin with, so you know when your going to work. And since they do under staff, expect to work twice as hard to get the job done. You will cover multiple departments. They shut the A/C on and off while your working and as soon as they close to cut costs I assume. The last hour is unbearably HOT & MUSTY. The building is always filthy dusty. I often felt sick when I worked there."
bad,Mangers do not posses the proper skills to mentor or lead work force and excessive work load placed on employees that can't not reasonably be achieved.
bad,...involved in a nationwide lay off after 8 months of employment with four day notice before lay off. then they called me back to work for  temporary assignment for Samsung repairs only. the company or job was not as secure as they made it seem in interview
bad,I worked in the portrait studio as a photographer and sales during busy season. Worked 8 hours with little breaks and short lunch on a weekend. Parents could be overly critical if child did'nt smile correctly.
bad,"Hated working here never felt like i was part of the team."
bad,"very unprofessional, and no security on job hours. do a good job, and it is never taken into consideration. you give an unwanted comment, and you are fired.pathetic."
bad,"Very slow paced environment, a lot of really young people worked there so it was very hard to work together as a team. Sales goals were outrageous and the management didn't really care."
bad,"Company had no vision and poor communication."
bad,Didnt like how i was treated. No one treated anyone with respect. Some of the people were worked like crazy. If anyone does work there keep to yourself
bad,"Obviously these people aren't with Sears now and aren't on commission sales. First of all there is no income your working on a draw so owing money back to the company for over $100,000 in sales cancelled because of no stock. Home stores getting in left over stock like toys, cribs things we don't even sell because it's furniture and appliances. Corporate not telling employees what's going on or what are they ding to make up for all the money employees made and lost on cancelled orders. You call this a good place just walk in to a home store and see what I mean!"
bad,"The company closed the store in the area, was fun to work for great working experience before they closed.learned a lot at this job before they took it out of the area"
bad,Management requires you to give up your life for the needs of the business.  Only work for 1 day every 2 weeks.  They do not care about their employees haven't had a pay raise in 4 years.  Only making $13 an hour.
bad,This company isn't worthy of working at because they don't pay the employees enough for all the work we did. They didn't give us great breaks on time. Employees would be on the floor for more than 5 hours with no breaks.
bad,would come in at 7 start up computers and clock in get show room ready and wait till techs got there. customers would start rolling in. oil changes new tires fixing flats and doing annual matenince on most vehicles.
bad,"The management has no care for employees, are not allowed to talk to other associates and speaking about what you think is correct will get you in trouble. You cannot be friendly with your managers as I quote, ""we are your managers, not your friends. You have to listen and do your job"". Work is doubled because no manager knows what they are doing and you will end up doing the same thing twice because the first time will definitely be wrong."
bad,If every you need to work for this Retailer just do it for the money. Way too much training and way too many changes in less then 6 months.  Unorganized and pressure more on training rather then revenue.
bad,This store management was falling apart when I applied because the store was going out of business. The hardest part was working with people who did not care and were paid the minimum wages possible by the company.
bad,We have closed over 700 stores in the past 5 years along with hours cut to our associates. Associates have not been given raises since 2008. Just cut HR out of distribution center.
bad,Didn't understand what a school schedule meant. Learned how to work independently. Not much direction. Managers were fair but sat in their office too much.
bad,"The management team has too many members and that causes a lot of room for miscommunication. Work place culture was very much like a high school, different departments weren't willing to help out other departments when help was needed."
bad,You can work 40+ hours and if you don't have the commissions (which means good customer traffic) youre paycheck doesn't pay the bills. Management asks a lot from you with no advancement opportunities regardless if youre the best associate. No raises either for the last 5 years or so. Raise freeze except for management.
bad,This company is a closing stores left and right and will never recover.  This is failing and not worth any time being employed unless you need an immediate stop gap employment prior to finding another job.
bad,The job had ridiculous requirements. Location was not busy. Typical day did not consist of much unless it was holidays. I did get to learn the computer system which i hope will help me in future jobs.
bad,If you are getting back in the work force. Sears is willing to provide a start. It was a nice way for me to remove the long gap in employment. I moved on to something that would allow me to provide for my family.
bad,"The pay wages were ""frozen"" were a number of years, Management was miserable and customers were not as friendly. I appreciate the experiences I had but Im better off without Sears in my life."
bad,Enjoyed meeting people as cashier. Your can lose your job if you don't get 1 or more credit card applications. Very pushy towards customers.  Never work there again. I would ask every customer if they wanted to apply and if they said no then I would not push it.  I got released because I did not meet goal of 1 or more per day. Turn over rate very high because of CC apps and smart plans.  If you did not meet one per day your future is short lived.
bad,"The call center I worked at has closed at this point I believe and I am not surprised. The company was much more concerned about moving the call centers offshore than paying people over here a living wage. They claimed you could ""write your own paycheck, but the reality was they continued to increase the expectations and decrease any commission earned."
bad,"Yo trabaje es un abuso lo que hacen con el vendedor aparte de que no pagan horas extras y tienen much falta de respeto, de verdad no entiendo como hay gente que la defiende, si el salario es de muerte."
bad,I hated working there. They push you like crazy for credit. No customer wants to open any credit cards and they want you to lie to customer about them credit. Worst job ever. Low pay bad management
bad,This sears location is a retail enviroment. this particular location has been closed for a few years. Management and constantly changing environments created an unstable work culture.
bad,Alot of promises made and never acted upon is the norm of what I remember from sears. Was not the greatest company to work for. Lots of long driving for money that isnt guaranteed.
bad,"Very hard to move up withon company. No job security, stores keep closing. Managers only care about protection agreements and credit applications, instead of sales."
bad,There was never enough hours to give to employees. To many employees so they didn't have to make employees full time or benefits. Another store only looking out for themselves. And they wonder why so many stores are closing.
bad,"Didnt like it very much, No moral, managers shouldnt have the roles they hve they are letting comp tank. Didnt learn much. Hardest park are the customers. Signage is missleding"
bad,"Absolutely horrible work place. Management could care less about respecting their employees and cares solely on making profit. Always blames all customer complaints on the workers but doesn't bother to schedule enough employees during each shift in order to help customers. Everything in the store is overpriced and they use outdated systems which takes extremely long to ring people through. Two people on average are on cash which makes it even more frustrating when there's a line up of people and management refuses to come out of their offices to help out. Store is always a mess which comes from the understaffing problem, and manager overall is just terrible to associate with and extremely judgemental.  With such poor management and respect for its employees this store will be lucky if it even lasts into the new year. Don't bother applying here, plenty of better paying jobs that prioritize their staff's wellbeing."
bad,id rather not its not that great of a company better used as a stepping stone to meet other companies and a good company to get your feet in the door and get good hands on training
bad,"Low pay, bad management, no work flexibility or a good schedule. They don't care about senority,  they make you take online courses about their culture the same they don't honor"
bad,"There was no enjoyable part of the job. It sucked, I really hated that job. A lot of people steals from also, I mean people steal period but when they stole things from there you never really know until it's too late."
bad,"This place is ok, but they are not professional, and there is no trust in this company. The leadership is in much need of improvement, the building needs to be renovated."
bad,They pay the minimum they can and want you to do everything on top info your own duties they expect you to help the cashiers but complain if your helping them for too long. The air conditioner was constantly breaking and since I was constantly moving and on the go organizing clothes and stocking the floor it was miserable.
bad,This was not my type of work. Confined to a headset for low wages getting berated and abused by customers was not fun. The jobs eventually were moved to the Phillipines.
bad,"Only received a few shifts a week at barely minimum wage. Hardly ever had any help, no real structure, employer was not reasonable, constant unnecessary work, and most importantly noone was happy."
bad,Work was easy enough but the place is falling apart- the management is overworked and underpaid. Uncomfortable work environment. Not my favorite place to work.
bad,I have worked here for over a year now and some of the managers not all but some are terrible at doing there Job. You want a certain Schedule but they won't give it to you. They will cut your hours without telling you. I'll admit there are some good employees and managers but a lot of them are not good. I am still working here but I am trying to find a new job. Key word: TRYING!! Sears has god clothing. Good stuff. It's just not the best place to work at. They need to update their technology and their registers.
bad,Quick staff turn around make for a unreliable staff. Mostly young kids. Performance is based only on credit card sales that has a 26% interest rate :/
bad,The only good thing about me working here was that it made me realize that I needed to stay in school and get my degree because this isn't the life for me.
bad,My experience working with Kmart at Bay Plaza was horrific and i would never recommend anyone to work in that establishment.The staff is unappreciated underpaid and overworked.
bad,"Appliance Sales sucks here, because they steal your customers, and your not there to stop it from happening. Long days with no sales sometimes, it really does suck."
bad,Management is a mess they will only pay minimum wage and expect you to make any raises yourself via commissions or credit card sales. you will never sell a credit card without lying to customers face.
bad,"I worked for the company in Hawaii. The management is the bad thing, They do not invest in there employees."
bad,I made the decision to go and work in management with Sears and it was the worse thing I have ever done. I highly recommend never to work there. Horrible. No respect.
bad,Its not a good place to work. I met one or two friendly people that's about it the business is very slow at the sears I worked at. I only worked one or two days a week.
bad,The management was shady. There was no chance of earning a raise or promotion. It felt like the job was dead end with no real chance of having any kind of stability.
bad,"The building has no air conditioning or heating. When you sell something and it gets returned ( delivery destroyed it, customer changed mind, it didn't work) for any reason you lose your commission. I make $4.50 salary per hour. Store is open all holidays & you work every holiday. The registers are very old and break down often. The floor is cement, the roof is wood and has leaks during the rain."
bad,you might as well work for free. The store can get very busy and stressful. They dont provide adequate help nor do they value their employees. very disappointed as a former employee.
bad,Sears was not the best company to work for. Only stayed working there because they were a little fleabke while my kids were young. Management was not helpful when you needed them.
bad,"Sears is not a good place for a job. Unless you only need 15 hours a week. They will cut hours for no reason. Store manager is terrible and homophobic. Managers play favorites. No matter what you do, your job is not secure. Do not work here long."
bad,"Manager forces you to push credit and cuts your hours if you can't force customers to open credit card. Horrible place to work, low morale because of management."
bad,"- Unprofessional Supervisors"
bad,It's a sinking ship and everybody just seems to be taking orders from somebody else. I've been there 8 years and the morale is dropping. I feel no reason to come to work anymore.
bad,"The work is easy, but the pay is low and the insurance isn't affordable. $360 every 2 weeks for family coverage that includes a $9000 deductible. The job would be ok for a 2nd income, but definitely not adequate for a one income family."
bad,"First off, you get underpaid for your job. You go busting your butt for the company, and you get treated like nothing. They promote you to management then a month later they got rid of your position and you find out you cant get your old job back so now you are out of a job. I would never recommend anyone work for this company."
bad,Does not provide good customer service for the work environment it promises.  Frequent shift cuts and poor management was a only a few of the problems I encountered; others included cleanliness and health hazards.
bad,"Horrible company. They have a lot of associates and are given maybe 8-12 hours per week of work. Many new hires leave within the first 45 days."
bad,"Unorganized, while the pay is very little compared to the actual work you have to put in.  Lunch is 30 minutes. Lots of micromanaging. Supervisors care less about their employees. Very high turn over rate."
bad,"Poor excuse for a Company "
bad,Work you to the bone and make you do other people's jobs that are not stated in your job description. They do not let you leave at the time you are scheduled off and they find reasons to give you points. And managers are extremely rude.
bad,"The store I had applied for lost my paperwork, was repeatedly told by my department manager they were searching for it.  Worked there for over a month and never received a paycheck."
bad,"Sears  has a liquidator of assets. Edward lampert ceo has a plan to sell off all sears and kmart buildings. Sell off sears craftsman,kenmore brands for filling his pockets. My message to any who is looking for a real job to support your family and life is look elsewhere.( No matter how desperate for work you are look elsewhere)my message to those working now for sears and kmart is leave before your frustration with them continues to progress."
bad,always under staffed lazy managers that want you to do their jobs for them without getting their pay they always have attitude and make the day a long rough tiring day for everyone working
bad,"The typical day at work was pretty stressful.  No one seemed to know what they were doing, management, regional, employees, no one knew.  We were forced into asking questions like your phone number, address, ect. which most customers were older and didn't understand why we wanted that information.  They wanted it for tracking purposes but we called it ""Shop Your Way."""
bad,There is nothing good about this company. They put you down and expect you to do well after that. The pay is awful and the people who you work with are not helpful at all.
bad,"Always dead so you just sat there and folded the whole store over and over again until your shift ended and you came in the next day to do the same. my coworkers treated me very poorly and it got to be very cliquey and they would all bad mouth everyone who wasn't working. half the time my managers weren't there and were not a big help and gave me one day notice that seasonal would be ending and i would be losing my job. my manager didn't even tell my other managers i was leaving so no one even knew. awful place to work. you will also only make $9 an hour and will never earn more no matter how long you will work there for- a girl was there for seven years and made the exact same as me (someone who just started). also very hard to earn more if you are making commission in a completely dead store and most sears are shutting down, so don't work there."
bad,"Just...no!"
bad,Sears is a good place to work for part time associates who have other jobs and/or school. They will work around your schedule to make sure you can make it to your primary oblegations
bad,"I feel I would work well providing detailed customer service, ability to work well under pressure. Able to take the immediate initiative when i see a problem occur, look to find the best way to solve a problem with little to no error in a timely fashion. Good self-management, very strict on time sensitive projects and getting task assigned to me complete smoothly. Lastly I am a team player that understand the functions of team effort that can make the work place an enjoyable place."
bad,Nothing really good to say. Cut throat company where everyone is out for themselves. Company has been a sinking ship for too many years. No stability.
bad,Do not work at this location! I have worked at this location for two days any my manager has been very disrespectful and rude towards me especially in front of customers. You are forced to sell credit cards and are penalized if you don't sell at least five a day. Training is very unorganized my manager was getting angry at me during my training because I was not doing things correctly and because I did not know how to sell the credit cards. I was put down by my manager in front of another employee as well because I did not know information on the credit card. Sears is not a good company to work for. Do not work at this location!
bad,manager was very rude and wasnt nice it was in woodbine centre mall costumers were nice i learned that never to work for this company i only worked there for 2 months
bad,"Surprisingly I stuck around for three months, I should have left sooner.  The store management was horrible and the culture of how the other employees would steal sales out from under you for the commission is pathetic."
bad,The company give continual focus on tasks that won't really matter in the end. Trying to implement ipads and customer reviews which most managers just have friends and family fill out.
bad,"The company has been slowly sliding downhill and will eventually be gone. The management is constantly changing due to not willing to pay for work. They promote a ""family friendly"" lifestyle but expect 90 hour work weeks."
bad,"Sears is a very hostile work environment. Management is part of the problem. There is a very significant problem with hostile Black females in the Sacramento Region, many of whom discriminate, and are hostile towards either coworkers or customers. And who are protected by Anglos, especially Anglo women, for their acts of hostility, and as typical of hostile workers especially hostile female workers, they blame their victims, instead of accepting responsibility for their actions or being held responsible. And typical hostility and discrimination by females from India. Thankfully, the media has reported that it is a common behavioral disorder problem amongst such people in not only this environment, but across other jobs as well. I would assess that such people account for the significant problems in the job industry. Unfortunately, some of the Latinos that work at this mall also join in on the discrimination towards an innocent victim of prohibited discrimination and hostility. Which is also common in the Sacramento Region."
bad,I will not go into specifics but the management was terrible after blowing through so many of them. they fired people for any reason they could give regardless of what they told staff about making sure you keep your numbers up.  So whatever sale you made you had to attach things to boost your sale and they would say whatever you can do to get the sale do it but then go ahead and say you were stealing from the company like you made any kind of commission on a bed frame. I refuse to even walk through the store til this very day.
bad,"Otra empresa parecida que te conviene infinitamente más que Sears es Liverpool. "
bad,Based on were i was located i wouldnt recommend working there the managers are rude the customers steal too much and the pay really doesnt help with paying bills that are needed for humans to survive.. please get the feel of your location before working there or even considering putting an application in
bad,"no growth, very little training and expected to provide customer service one on one with customers, I felt the company should at least provide product information"
bad,Worked here during high school. Was not a good company to work for. If you did not get people credit cards they would fire you. This location closed 3 summers ago.
bad,"Sears is not what it used to be.  If you are commissioned, they will cut the commission rates down over and over, so that even if you are really good with sales, you won't make much above minimum.  There is not really room for advancement, and even if you do manage to get a job with more responsibility, your pay will still be very close to minimum wage.  "
bad,"Management was terrible and very inconsistent. Managers quitting, sales reps quitting. Overall, a terrible work place. The store manager was rude. Pay was BAD."
bad,"This job is horrible and the mangers are rude and unprofessional"
bad,You will not get a good lead if danny b. is still there! How does the selling manager get to hand out the leads? Upper management looked the other way?
bad,Picture this. You do well in sales and someone is continuously harassing you about getting people to sign up for high interest rate credit cards at a place that is about become bankrupt.
bad,"Working here is a nightmare. If you do or say anything wrong, managers take away your hours. Everything has to me done one specific way or else you get lectured and made to redo it over and over again. You also get very little pay for an extreme amount of work. I dreaded coming to work everyday."
bad,my manager was so rude because of someones sexuality and judged them. she wouldnt give nobody days off especially if they had a family emergency. the pay was terrible which was 6.50. she also never wanted to do anything was rude to the customers as well.
bad,They don't stand behind their merchandise.I hated having to explain to a customer that without all paperwork there is nothing I can do. Plus salary was dependent on sales. I did not like pushing daled to make my paycheck.
bad,The company has changed over the last 10+years.  They used to care for their employees but that changed in 2005.  I would'nt recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Went to work there, first week I had no employee number got sent home after 3 hours everyday. next week got my number but manager was walking work orders to the other mechanic, when there is little work this is a big problem. This place has below base pay salaries and no customers to get your commissions. They mainly do oil changes and tires if your trying to make a living go some were different."
bad,"This place is not a good place to work. There is little to no opportunity for advancement. You will never get a raise and the customers are all rude. You will often hear, ""This is why you work at Sears"" used as an insult to you when things are not going the customer's way."
bad,"I was a phone sales clerk. I answered phone calls, took orders, and tallied the results. I also was eligible for complaints. There were also meetings to attend."
bad,Kmart is a place where the better you work the more work you will have to do The company is poorly managed and the low level employees are required to do the work of management.
bad,"Customers are beaten down to get credit cards, buy protection agreements, and a"
bad,I always hated this job because I always did the same thing every Tues/Thurs. Never any changes schedule never changed hours never changed lunch hours never changed
bad,"This company is DONE! Me and other professionals in the LP world are trying to figure out why are they still hiring?? Lol. If you are entering this field, you will get better experience elsewhere."
bad,"there are no benefits for working at Sears. no dscounts, and no insurance . if you work there long enough you accumuate  vacation hourss not days. you are expected to push credit applications , the reward program and sel lprotection plans. as a cashier you are based on all the criterea except protection plans . if you dont reach goal you are let go.you are expected to be flexable in hours and the only day Sears closes is Christmas day. management is non existance when it comes to customer problems. theyll talk to you over the phone but hesitate to come out. the future of Sears is bleak so no hope for advancement. all sounds negative but thats the way they operate"
bad,very stressful job and very angry customer. I would not refer this job to anyone. Very busy job with answering the phones and listening to customers complain alday.
bad,"The managers there are rude and only care about how they look and thus will take credit for all the worker's work. Anyone could be fired at any moment if the position is not needed at the store and then will open the position back up. I have seen coworkers with 30+ years of work, just fired for the position being ""useless"". There is never enough workers so the work is that of 3+ people. There is no appreciation there so work morale is very low. I have come to hate that job but I sadly love my coworkers."
bad,"Been their 15 years. Have had no hours for the past two weeks. No hours to give. When they hire you they don't tell you that from Jan-May you will have no hours or very few. Therefor is a seasonal job at best. Fourth quarter from June/July-Dec you will have more hours than you can handle. Then nothing. They use the few people they have to multi task many jobs to make up for the employees they give no hours to. Their is NO SENIORITY in as far as whether you get hours or not which I find very disrespectful. Yet, they continue to hire people."
bad,The first month was good but then they would forget to give me days and hours I would always need to call and never get ahold of the main boss poor service poor support.  They closed in April due to the fact they close the 3d floor and everything was still being ship to them like we has 3 floors when we only had 2. There was no room for anything and then they would hire these kids who didn't care for there jobs .. making those who really need it have less hours also before they closed I was needing my w2s and I had to go through so much trouble getting them becouse they close me out of the sears account I had to look up my w2s. I had to go to the irs twice and then call a few places also sears network is a joke. No one answers you.
bad,Pay is mostly commissioned based and despite being one of the top sales persons in the area rarely received above minimum wage. Poor management. Do not recommend working there
bad,"Management expectations are really high for sales goals. Pay is minimal. Expect you to stay past closing to clean or help with other departments. only one break, constantly on your feet. No room for growth. Unexpected scheduling. Drama, like high school everyone in everyone business rather than doing work."
bad,employees stop caring about company ethics and now no one cares how you do your job. I would say this company is about to resign and the only people who care are the ones who opened the business years ago.
bad,"a typical discriminating and corrupt retail environment"
bad,"i worked there for about 7 months and i got a lot of customer complaints and disrespect from my managers. i was also ""pushed"" to exceed standards that were impossible to achieve and to do jobs that were not shown in the form filled out prior to employment. i learned a lot from the workplace, but store policies were always changing in a negative manner, which made it hard to properly stay on task. The manager was always unprepared and rude towards me. the hardest part of the job was to clean the cash register. it would take hours to do and when i worked commission, time is money. the most enjoyable part was the training. It taught me a lot about marketing, credit cards, stocking, and how to engage in a productive conversation with customers."
bad,"No two managers were ever on the same page. You were quite often told by one to do project A, and then manager two would come and tell you you have to do project B instead, neither of the communicating to each other what they had you working on. You could advance to a management position, like I did. There is 0 manager training unless you get into the GEM program, which is hard to do. For the most part, you get one days overview of what you need to do then your kinda thrown to the wolfs. Sears is a dying company no matter what they say, I would not seek a career there."
bad,"After working there for 3months, I still had no idea who my actual manager was. Department manager was extremely melodramatic and too gossipy to be professional. Hours were extremely low (four per week for a whole month). Also pushing credit apps and financing programs was a bit too much and probably scared off many customers. Bonuses were easy to achieve through sales and credit apps. Store is in much need of new carpet and possibly a complete remodel. Extremely outdated. If you request a day off, count on being scheduled for that day, but probably not the next."
bad,"I worked here for my first seasonal job. I worked in back stocking shoes it was the easiest job i have ever had. Management was good, and it was a good experience."
bad,If you ever worked seasonal they  try to make you  do all the work  while there permanent employees do no work  they stand  there watching you  look a here I'm just temporary  not you people slave made us work on thanksgiving day all day well I will never ever do  it again I'll be at home on thanksgiving day from now on no retail work for me
bad,They had very bad management. Not enough people or hours in that Reno location. For closing shift they did not consider the employees that had to endure the bus routes
bad,There was no room for growth within the company.  you are hired as a phone rep and thats where you stayed.  My attendance was great and so was my stats.. I would like the opportunity to more up in a company that I like and enjoyed.
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. long hours, only advancement is if you are cool with the RM or any person from corporate . long hours, and working holidays."
bad,"Es una pena que una empresa tan prestigiosa y valiosa como lo era ,haya terminado como lo que es ahora , que en lugar de sentirse privilegiado de haber laborado para ella , ahora de vergüenza y lastima de perder el tiempo de trabajar ahí ."
bad,The franchise owner was an illeterate douchebag. He gave my job to his drinking buddy who couldnt cut it in sales. My chimney dept was closed a month later as he sucked. I worked hard to run all that stuff and was paid minimum wage and given maximum disrespect!
bad,"My co workers were what made the job for me. "
bad,"It is difficult working there when they do not value customers. Customer satisfaction very low.CEO wants online store, is closing all Sears and Kmarts"
bad,A company who is quickly going out of style.  Will be gone soon as a company.  Did not know how to treat its workers very well.  Lots of internal issues.
bad,too much work for how they paid. rude CEO. never again. way too many hours. employees re not  trained correctly. they were never true to their word so no thanks
bad,"Do not go work there, can not trust management, auto service tech break things on cars more than fixing it. Most of time you are left hanging  by your self, answer 95% of phone calls and will receive 95% of oil changes. Worst place I have ever worked and I am in auto business over 20 years."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. You come in one day and you can be laid off without notice. No raises, no praises. Management sucks. Do not waste your time working here. this is the round rock , location. if you apply here and they hire you the next round of lay-offs you will probably be one of the ones getting laid off."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, I was misinformed several times in my interview as well as in training. There is no advancement here and  little incentives."
bad,"Managers are not trained to do their job. So there is no way to advance or be trained right for the job you would like to advance in."
bad,"I was a sales associate who would work with customers, fold clothes, and sometimes help out with the cash register as needed. this was a slow paced job."
bad,ive worked for this company for a year and i proven myself time and time again i can do the job that is given to me when thy are given out Sears forgets that its works are the back bone of the company not the 20+ vps they have
bad,It's a good place to get hands on experience after hvac school but that's about all.  Get experience and leave.  All the company cares about is number of completed jobs per day and if you sold any thing. They're pushing the sears home warranty for $70/month plus a deductible. If you can't meet their quota they put you on a sales help program.  They over schedule you then it's your job to tell the customer you will not be there because of being overbooked. That's more time on the phone and less time you have to actually do your job.  You will have multiple appliances that are junk with numerous parts replaced.  Call center tells Custer they need the tech to say it's unrepairable to be replaced. Guess what... tech is not allowed to do that.  That adds to you recalls that take away from your completed calls.  If you don't meet quota of completed calls they drastically shorten the hours you're allowed to work.  I was there a little over 2 years and never received a raise.  Medical insurance for just me not including my family was over $600/month. I asked for a raise I was told that wasn't going to happen. We're working for a failing company.  The only real training I received there was how to sell warranties and vast items at a 2 week training class in Chicago.   I will admit that was fun.  It was basically an all expense paid vacation.  If you have just finished hvac school it's a good job to get experience when every one else wants experienced techs.
bad,Pay was very low and the amount of work was overwhelming. High expectation for almost little pay. Management was careless and ignored a hectic environment.
bad,I found myself standing around waiting to do things on a regular basis. It doesn't help that a lot of customers thought the mall was shutting down so they didn't want to show up to Sears. Overall this job isn't worth it. Severely underpaid and not enough consistency.
bad,"SEARS Canada removed all there customer service call Centre jobs to outside Canada, Before the move it office was a good place to work, people are nice and you are treated well"
bad,This place is a terrible place to work the manager aren't organized and don't know what they are doing at all and the store just sucks in general. I hate it
bad,The job was my first job and I stayed and understood the concept of customer service. I worked as appliance sales person. My day was to wait around to see if customers had any questions on product. If they decided to buy then my challenge is to sell them a 5 year warranty with the product.
bad,"A lot of employees are looking else work for work, sears doesn't have culture. I have been gone and hear the negative stories. New management. Bounuses"
bad,"Poor workplace culture. Low morale. Dirty. Little organization. "
bad,"The expectation of the job is accurate. Trainings are long and high turn-over rate due to the inflow of calls. Sales bonuses are a joke! One day you can be doing really well, by the second day you are down. Team environment is non-existent."
bad,Does not care about hourly Associates no opportunity to grow within company stores are consistently closing too many people at corporate office overlapping job that has same responsibilities
bad,"This company is the worst ran, mis communicated place I've ever worked at.. I spend a few years in various departments, I was always treated like a number.. never a person.."
bad,i learned to always be on time it was hard work but the people i worked with always made it tolerable. i learned good time management and how to work together as a team.
bad,"Very unhappy,.laid off after 22 years after dedicating my life and time. And was treated horribly the entire time. I understand business , but there is no loyalty from this company to it's employees."
bad,I was hired for seasonal help. I never knew my schedule and then when I did try getting something to accommodate my school and schedule as a mom I could never hear back from them. I tried calling and would never hear back. I ended up just showing up to work one day to get my 1st check to find out I was fired because I didn't fit the needs of a seasonal worker. I absolutely hated that job. I only worked about 4 hours a day maybe 3 times a week.
bad,"a typical day at work for Sears is to always greet people with a smile no matter if a coworker or customer. I always make my floor nice and neat looking if its not that way I get it in order.I stock what may be overflow in the back area and report to my supervisor for any feedback on a job that may be needed done. Usually I will get special projects assigned to me."
bad,will never work here a day in my life its honestly a dead end job no room for opportunity or to grow or move up the ladder of success. so  yeah  never again .
bad,What can I say. Declining company. Very few opportunities and even fewer customers. For a commission employee that is a death sentence. When I started in 2009 in the appliance department things went well. After three years I had moved my hourly wage to twenty dollars an hour. As time went on business started to fall off. My final year our store was down to only two mangers from a high of ten. Sales people in my department fell to four from a high of thirteen It's sad to see a onetime great place  turn into a crumbling company.
bad,"I worked here when it was bought by Kmart and there was no training program I had no boss for months and was thrown into being a buyer, when I finally got a boss I had already put my two weeks in.  I think now they have a training program so things may have changed."
bad,"There is a serious lack of support for employees in this company. Management are generally good people, but are more concerned about losing their own jobs than helping customers and employees. Training is non-existent, new employee's are thrown out to the floor and are expected to learn as they go, and are fired if they do not pick it up fast enough. Hours are given based on ""performance"", but if you get full time hours one week, prepare to have your hours cut back for the next two."
bad,"a good experiece for anyone looking for a first job, a good team to become apart of, and good sales and associate are treated fairly well."
bad,"The only good thing about this company is I was able to work and attend school as a full time student. This company values workers who will kiss up instead of those who will work hard and earn promotions. There are no benefits for part timers, no guaranteed hours, and the associates discounts were taking away. Overall, sears is one of the worse companies to work for."
bad,it was very hard some time and i really want top be on the floor to help people out and everything but they wouldnt let me at all so i want to different job and i was happy they was rude
bad,I would go in be stuck on register all day. I wasn't trained to the best ability. I would get in trouble for doing what I was suppose to. They would cute hours really bad all of a sudden and the commission thing wasn't fair.
bad,it's a horrible place to work blah blah blah blah blah they want you to do everything in your power to make them look good but when you need help they leave you to figure it out.
bad,Not worthed! A couple of Managers use their authority in the worst way. This place will probably close down soon due to the way they treat their employees. Most employees tell their friends and family how they were treated. Appliance Manager has a very bad attitude. Another manager got her position taken away for yelling at whoever she don't like and treating younger girls better. The company are for their rude managers!
bad,"Getting there to late on Saturdays (BART 40-50 min,) I did not like the breaks very poor time (15 min) always doing the same tasks (to strict) always getting in trouble with the Supervisor"
bad,"Hated it working at sears! HORRIBLE place i worked at the one in pasadena mall. "
bad,provide a sanitized environment to patients visitors physicians and employees.remove soiled linens cleaned and sanitize vacuumed carpets and rugs
bad,Expect cashiers to get 15 credits a shift when its dead. Hours are based on credits. Not a lot of credits no hours. Co workers are nice . Management expect too much. Expect one cashier to close the upper floor with no back up. Call for back up no one shows up.
bad,"I would put out stock, run cash register, and help customers. The hardest part was the terrible management and not knowing if I was doing the right thing or not. One manager would tell me to do something and then I would see another manager and they would yell at me for doing the thing that I was told to do. However, I did enjoy the other employees that I worked with and I learned a lot about working in retail."
bad,the attitude of the customers due to multiple people in the company nto caring about this or that is appalling. The pay was medium but the attitude was the worst
bad,"A typical day at work was coming in and taking calls from members who needed assistance. This company is very dishonest, unstable, and I would not recommend them to anyone."
bad,The pay was nice but they have to pay because everybody knows it is a sinking ship.   While some employees and leaders truly want to succeed the rest are riding out until they can retire
bad,"They are a horrible place to work for. They offer benefits and commission but do not go through with it. They were supposed to give me a raise, but never did. Instead they kept me on as a manager only making what the rest of the employees made. Their store is hazardous and they are not good to the customer."
bad,"Terrible management, little to no incentive for success, heavy penalties for mistakes in new employees.  Would not recommend this company, even among competitive retail environment."
bad,"The Call Center Management team of Tucson, Az. Is horrible at best, VERY unprofessional. The only thing I really enjoyed was my customers and trying to fix whatever issues that this/ counter parts call centers caused"
bad,"associates do all the work and are not rewarded. management is terrible and LP is rude."
bad,"Sears is a failing company. They just moved all Sears IT employees to a contract company. This contract company is randomly selecting people to leave, with the intentions of getting rid of all IT and outsourcing all to India (no surprise there). So, applying is just wasting your time, unless you like working in an environment that is anti anything/anyone not from India, and enjoy working in an environment that you never know when you will be let go (and you will because that is the companies direction)."
bad,"not the best vcompany I worked for. bottom line is getting worse each day with more store closers"
bad,Terrible company for work for. The pay was terrible and they did not give any raises. The managers were not very helpful and it was very hard to talk to them. They were very stand offish.
bad,"Severely over worked, under appreciated work environment. No clear direction, with NO communication or collaboration between other business areas."
bad,"The building is falling apart. It is filled with asbestos and leaky roofs. It is one week away from developing black mold."
bad,Sears auto center is not a good place to work at. They over work their workers and expect to much from them. Open 7 days a week and schedule you 12 hour shifts with minimum wage pay.
bad,This place is no longer in business but was a good job when I had it as long as you had techitions that wanted to work and go out to houses.
bad,"They don't care about their employees safety or health at all.Unsafe and unfair workplace environment."
bad,buenas prestaciones buen sueldo  la direccion no tiene idea de como mnejar una empresa  disponen de descansos y de tiempo de la gente abusan de las mujeres embarazadas  horarios extremadamente largos ast de 16 horas al dia.
bad,i worked at the london location in ontario and it was a horrible experience. only met a few people that were respectful. just a bad experience. not great management
bad,If you work at the Concord store in jewelry you will have to deal with a very rude co-worker with a service dog.  Nothing at all nice to say animal lovers stay away.
bad,I do not wish to review this company more than to say that it made an ok place to work when I had no prior work experience. The schedule was whacky and the HR department was garbage.
bad,"You can not trust to work management.They fire you at any time they wish "
bad,People work long and hard days with little break.  Compensation is extremely low and schedule changes without notice.  Management only cares about them selves.
bad,"in my opinion the management is not friendly, difficult to talk to and not good at problem solving. My co-workers  were young and unexperienced"
bad,"Having experienced what I did, this company really plays up to having favorites, and the people who are just there to make them look good.  Not a positive environment."
bad,this site was horrible. managers where never where they were supposed to be. People got written up because the managers failed to follow up with certain aspects of the jobs and passed the blame onto the employees to save themselves
bad,"There is a lack of management and staffing, so the employees that do work there have to do the job of six people causing it to be exstreamly stressful place to work."
bad,"This is absolutely the worst job I have ever had.  I was a cashier for 3 months and that is the shortest amount of time for me to have worked at any job. I tried to find anything positive about working for this place and could find none.  Our job was all about how many credit card applications we could get the customer to try to apply for and the practices we were encouraged to use to get them to sign were shady at best.  You were pressured to repeatedly ask them if they ""were sure"" they didn't want to at least try and by the time you were done asking more often than not, you had an angry customer leaving the store.  The store manager called our cashier station every hour to see how many we had and if you replied ""none"" you were threatened with either being sent home early or fired.  Shop Your Way, the Sears rewards program was another big push.  It wasn't about helping the customer or getting through the line quickly or even keeping your area clean.  It was all about credit apps and SYW sign ups.  Upper management truly believes these products will save the company but the major appeal of Sears - its core products and customer service - are gone.  They no longer care about customer service.  Eddie Lambert is hammering the final nail into the coffin of this company. I regret I spent even a minute there.  My overall experience was a nightmare"
bad,i never felt like i was appreciated or compensated fairly.. also the hours and holidays that were mandatory to work and blacked out vacation dates were discouraging
bad,Not a good place to work. All they care about is money. If you are sick you must go into work no matter what. Management is not professional. Just overall not a good environment to be around
bad,"not worth the time anymore everything has changed "
bad,A terrible company to work for with bad managers/ management. I would never work for this company ever again period. No room for advancement none what so ever. This company sucks..
bad,"Sears will cheat you of full time benefits,i worked part time yet worked 38 hours a week,theres no raises whatsoever,managers are okay. They will over work Minors and keep them past 11pm sometimes.Credit cards are the only way this company survives. Cashiers get the most talks about pushing sears cards and if you dont get a certain amount,they WILL FIRE YOU regardless of how good you may work."
bad,"I was working 6 days in a week, 1 day off. And the store when I was hiring my pays per hours gonna be 12.50 when I saw my check was 8.38. When I went to the office notboday know nothing about it. I try to speak with human resource and notbody answer the email and never answer the phone bad company really bad. I worked 1 month and never pay me that he said."
bad,"Sears is not a secure company and do not think of their employees."
bad,Working for sears outlet was like working in a high school Drama everywhere. the mangers favor people your sales can be taken by them and they will never tell you. the hardest part of the job was the people you worked with. The job could have been great it is wasn't like a high school.
bad,"The associates I worked with were great. The company is all about metrics, namely credit apps. That's it Credit apps, if you don't reach the required amount you're fired I still don't know how many but fired anyways. Was told that if you couldn't take your lunch by a certain time clock out and work anyways, was told to create fake emails for customers to sign them up for rewards program. Called for a member of management to handle an irate customer after ten minutes no one came customer was extremely upset issue wasn't resolved. Under staffed skeleton crew and you're expected to answer phones help customers on the floor and not supposed to leave your area, a little hard to do when you are the only one there.  Do not recommend working here. I unfortunately took this job over another offer, got fired 2 weeks before Christmas"
bad,"Most of the management there is horrible. There is only about 2% of management you can truly trust and depend on to get you the help you need. The HR department is the biggest joke ever. If you are harassed by a manager do not count on them to have your back. The managers there if you do not kiss their butt or be buddy, buddy with them you will not succeed. Also if you have computer issues you might wanna be scared. Just saying."
bad,Sears is not a company you will have an oppurtunity for advancement none this isnt anything im interested in so thisbis it
bad,As a current employee.... the management is so poor... the structure and employees are too few/untrained. The store is messy.... etc. Not a good place to work or shop!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,At the time I was there the company was going through a difficult transition starting with a new CEO all the way to the renovation of its stores nationwide. It's was very stressful and very cut throat during these times.
bad,"Worked for sears for almost 3 years. Never got full-time, never got a raise. Minimum wage but they continuously added work for us to do. Had to mostly work alone doing customer pick-ups Where you had to load washers and dryers, riding mowers, treadmills and other items. You only had 5 mins to load each customer if not they get a 20% off coupon and management will  complain but you are working alone. 3 or 4 customers will come at once how are you suppose to load all of them in 5 mins alone. Management will nit pick about the appearance of the warehouse but you're alone. Would have to climb on top on the forklift and high shelves to get products because of no help. No respect, no appreciation management use to say be glad you have a job."
bad,"This place had very little hours to give, and a lot of work. They like to cram your work in small amount of time, with a lot of running around. They do give opportunities to those workers who want more hours."
bad,"This store is so desperate to hire people, they are hiring just about anyone.  As long as they pass a drug test.  Management is a joke; a bunch of racist bigots.  Good luck trying to get working SNICKS/IPADS!!   They never work and never charged.  "
bad,"Sears has taken a century of good work and ruined it in ten years. The problem here is the middle management. I'd tell you why but Sears wont read this, so who cares right?"
bad,"Lack of planning and outside of the box thinking has held Sears back for decades.  Talent comes and goes yet they can seem to change, as the senior management refuses to adopt to 21st century consumer expectations. Growth, culture... no more words necessary.  Even with their more recent revamps on the brand, it's still not enough in the eyes of the consumer as the store experience remains constant."
bad,"This job is should only be meant for high school students who need a summer job. Pay is as low as you can get, no benefits, no learning what-so-ever. Can't take management seriously."
bad,"This store closed years ago without any warning. Work was distributed through Staff Management, which made getting hours a hit or miss proposition. R.I.P."
bad,"The management lied about the pay and benefits.  There is good reason why Sears SUCKS and is on it's way out of business.  The stores are empty, pay is low, scheduled hours are unreliable, benefits suck, management is the worst.  Run away from this job as fast as you can!"
bad,"awful place to work, very stressful and no support from management. as soon as you get to work the drama begins, co-workers are hit and miss some are really good and some are really bad. I don't enjoy anything about sears, wait maybe the discount."
bad,this job is a joke ! just completely terrible ! the boss use to sniff crack in the back office and the office was so unorganized and so unprofessional ! I would never recommend this job to anyone ! the pay checks took forever to clear and it was just a mess !
bad,My day would start of with participating in the early morning employee huddle to discuss our previous and whats going on in the Company.After which i would walk the sales floor and make sure there was not any known safety issues.
bad,The company is being grossly mismanaged.  Zero opportunities for growth.  Zero liquidity.  Stores closing.  Layoffs and constant restructuring.  Don't walk...RUN!
bad,"They hire so many young people, which causes a lot of conflict with everyone. There's is no room for growth and they don't pay well at all."
bad,"I enjoyed being in customer service. I learned to sell credit card very fast/ The management on the other hand was, unorganized, unprofessional, prejudice and rude."
bad,They treated their employees with no respect in the end by laying everyone off without a word of notice. The company sucks
bad,"if you're looking for a place where you get hours regularly and the management & employees respect you, this is most definitely not the place for you."
bad,dont ever work here so not worth the pay you have to do everything in the store for no money at all. you basically run the whole store by yourself cause they only have one person scheduled tgo work a shift
bad,The most unorganized company I have worked for.  The management has no glue on what it takes to successfully have a company that people would love to come to.  It starts with your employees who is the face of the company. Keep the employees happy and its free advertising for you. You work hard give your all and slap in the face at the same time. I no longer shop at Sears because I know how they operate. I recommend that people spend their money where people still appreciate your patronage.
bad,"First job. Manager was not good with promoting, or giving extra hours or training. other employees that were working at the job were not very helpful either."
bad,They treat their employees poorly ....and let you go. I got hurt on the job didn't want to file it for workman's comp i got the surgery and then they fired me.
bad,Store 1355 is one of the worst stores ever being so ill managed and failing ever since January of this year. The store manager is incompetent and does not take his employees recommendations or personal overview and insight to make the store a more enjoyable place. Plus the pay was horrendous workingf on <1% commision rate and getting $6.25 an hour. This was the worst place I have ever worked for and worst company. And literally the Store Manager I had had so many complaints against him that it was amazing how he was still there.
bad,"Management always changing. a unfair bonus structure. Unrealistic call volume per day. Dispatcher alway Quitting ,have no idea how to  route technicians in the city. Lack of parts to complete calls to make Bonus."
bad,"Outdated policies, processes and lack of of any type of operational controls make it extremely hard for Store Management to be successful. Basically set up for failure.............."
bad,"Worked here for about a year and a half. It started out okay but dwindled down a lot with management. Moving from one position in the store to another can sometimes be easy and sometimes its all about what manager likes you. Managers should be a lot nice. The softline s managers were horrible. They would not work with you on your schedule. My store manager was great i couldn't ask for anyone better but the softlines manager and the softlines lead are horrible they are rude and dishonest. They never take credit for things they have done and they always.blame the employees under them. also softline managers should not make comments as such "" well they are below me so they are my little minions and do what i want"""
bad,"This Sears location needs a lot of work, especially management. As I worked as a Cashier, I was constantly hounded by getting the credit card application. It was unnecessary stress and it should among other cashiers the constant stress of making our numbers. I do not recommend working at Sears."
bad,"The company is not a good company to work for, people will steal and lie to cut your throat in company. The company is going under due to bankruptcy and the stores left , the trust in the store is slim to none"
bad,"Sears was not a good place to work. There was camaraderie among most of the employees, but the store manager did not treat employees like people. The credit card policies led to shady practices among employees. A typical day at work involved standing around and waiting for a customer to hassle into signing up for multiple store credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers."
bad,The Managment sucked. The pay was terreble. No room for advancement. Would not recomend this job to anyone. 1 manager in particular would yell and scream and degrade you for no reason.
bad,While I worked here the store manger was a total bully and he did his best to cover it up in front of his bosses the pressure to make a sale was super high and no one liked it
bad,"Extremely horrible management. Every one that work at sears have a second agenda they want to bring the company down . Mangers got jealous when i work better , was smarter .Lost prevention work with employees to steal.Lie on good employees, and bad employees stay. Managers never hired the best employees for the job because they scare the top managers are going to fired them.  A lot of back stabbing and hate. Sears need to close down because the employees are not working they are just pretending to do there job in front of the top managers. I feel sorry for sears because they hired good people in 2014-2016. but the old workers are just destroying the place. My manager was jealous and hated the store. A message to Sears Company watch your employees they are working to bring your company down anyway possible."
bad,"They are so worried about points. The top people from Wichita is always on the management butt and their employees getting points. I felt horrible for the managers and they do not deserve it, specially when cashier are trying their best. They are also very worried about stealing. My husband brought me shoes to work because i wore flats (bad idea). I was fired for stealing with ""my husband"". I should have fought it."
bad,To many people wanting to many different things and all at once.  Crazy around the holidays.  Large focus on getting credit apps
bad,"Te company was constantly changing your pay and the turn over rate is very high, I enjoyed my co-workers but most never stuck around long,"
bad,Sears is the worst place to work. Strict unnecessary rules were placed. Management does not help when needed. When you're new you have to teach yourself because no one else will.
bad,forced to work weekends no job security bad management I suspect the company will no longer exist in a few years not big on giving breaks.
bad,The company of sears is a great place to work especially  in malls and super center locations. Unfortunately  the Sears in Weatherford  OK is not such  of a place. From negative management and terribly work ethic to sales reps forcing customer to buy product  that they don't need just to make number. This store is one job that I didn't not enjoy
bad,"horrible management, no HR in the building, extremely low pay, managers are unfair with scheduling, if they dont like you will not give you hours. Can not survive off of this income."
bad,"The management of where I worked was despicable. The job itself was terrible. Everybody was always fighting. When I was on injury leave, I got a letter saying that the Kmart in my area was closing."
bad,"Drove a van bus for 4 yrs."
bad,slow...no comisson... wasnt trained. hated it. No air conditioning. All the sales I made was sent to other coworkers paycheck. Never liked being here. Big mistake.
bad,"Lies, terminations on the spot. You don't get Sears credit apps you're gone. Permanent 7.25 an hour for cashiers. 6.00 an hour for home improvement plus commission minimum, and if you don't get purchase agreements, you're gone too. They also want phone numbers in their system they can't afford to advertise,would rather text you 20 times a month."
bad,The pay sucks. The managers suck. All they do is lie and over work you and sell dreams. Turn over rate is very high. Always short staffed. Little to no hours ever
bad,"I worked there for a year. Working with a skeleton crew while the store manager sat in the office every day. Most of the time, there was only a store lead and 3 cashiers for the store. Day consisted of customer complaints, getting stock out, markdowns ad sets and giving breaks. Pay was low, work load was high."
bad,Would be a great company with the right management no pay raises you start at minimum wage and that's it no good training turn over rate very high
bad,"This place was horrible. Its worst being a Lead named Kimone who couldn't hide her blatant favoritism, its best being the fact its closing. The majority of management was filled with incompetence and a blatant disregard for its staff and customers, the staff was a reflection of management and some of the most uncouth I've ever been around. My co-workers, the majority on the first floor, were sweet hard-working people but the cashiers and everyone else were just lackluster in regard to their work ethic and professional attitude. Bringing up any problems were met with excuses and lies, the place reeked of deception. The people who wanted to make money but were actually friendly and competent were given less hours under the guise of a lack of hours while the bully on campus kimone took them all for herself and her favorites. It was like being in junior high or elementary all over again. I hope that the good people find success in their future professional ventures and the rest never get into customer service again."
bad,"The intigrity, excellent customer service, and selling a quality product it not the Sears that it us to be.  I do not recommend purchasing any contracts, products, or services from sears.  Employment only if a matter of life and death.  Do it at your own risk.  Sears has the worst turn over rate of all times until it is a embrassment. Look how many stores have closed and are closing."
bad,"Working here for years and never thought to steal or do anything unethical to the company but their loss prevention team makes it uncomfortable. They're not friendly and when you make honest mistakes they want to investigate you, which affects relationship throughout store. Seen them handcuff employees for things a discussion would have solved! No proper training, just sit in front of a computer for hours watching videos tutorials with the new equipment you won't ever use. Managers look at you like your stupid because your confused and no one is in the store able to show you anything! Pay you pennies while you never can get enough done! Every week regional managers come inspect but managers only do what's required 1 day before visit then lower employees take the blame! Most of my co workers and managers only work when the store manager is near. Some of my co workers literally only collect a check, but everyone isn't so lucky to be "" buddy, buddy"" with your supervisor. P.S. All the managers go to lunch together so when you need one their usually in the food court while a customer is calling you an idiot for not being able to find a MANAGER! Id rather cut pennies in half all day and keep the change!"
bad,"Sears/Kmart is a failing company because of it's liberal leadership. This company expects you to be an expert at what you do but will only pay you an apprentice salary. This company structure is waste. "
bad,"Fast-paced, Customer Service Driven, Team Effort, Easy Money,"
bad,Very tense environment since the company is struggling.  Workers being laid off left and right. They don't have enough cashiers to service customers.  They give a boat load of hours to commissioned only employees and expect them to perform tasks they're not willing to pay others to do.  Managers are constantly in fear of their job.
bad,I've worked at Sears for two years and they decided to close my store. No relocation is guaranteed and no severance for part time employees even if you work 39 hours.
bad,"This is not the sears your parents had. The pay was poor and all pay incentives are based on how many overpriced add ons you can sell to the customer. I could lead the district in sales, but still get a poor review so that the pay structure would not increase. you will work on ""black-out"" dates. this is every holiday and any ""sale"" they have, your vacation plans are non existent because of this."
bad,"Management looks down on the employees. No advancement, no pay raise. Don't even bother asking for a few days off, even if it's a month in advance(they will ignore your request, so don't bother making any plans). Pressure to get credit card apps (doesn't matter if you're not a cashier, flies won't even come in). Management will bully you and treat you like a child (embarrass you). Don't bother HR with any issues because they will throw you under the bus there is no ""confidential discussions"" A lot of favoritism and gossip. Only good thing about the job was all the running around and losing weight."
bad,"I have worked for this company almost 3 years, it is definitely a company not worth the stock price. Training is nonexistent and managers play favorites, the pay is terrible and those ""other opportunities"" for increasing your earnings are only available to a select few, usually the manager's friends. Internal job openings always go to those same people. The amount of work expected from the rest of us I ridiculous, we frequently unload trucks with too few people and some don't even have time to do the jobs they are coded for and are consstantly berated for it. If you need to make a living stay away, you're better off at Walmart or in fast food than working here."
bad,Management was not the best and hours were always up and down. break was only 30 min and staff was always short.the general manager mohsin was rude to employees.
bad,"Manager doesn't do his part, there is no communication amongst the manager or the team, it's a stressful environment to work in and they don't want you to grow and want sears to be your main priority, they don't pay well at all , or you will never get a pay raise and they cut hours left and right the manager doesn't  even like his job he said he only took it because of the job title , the pay is only $9.70 , They will fire you for the most dumbest things, they can't take criticism well u can't voice your opinion or your job is on the line, it's nothing but high school drama there , sears has a number u call if u have a issue at work with Mangers or even with other workers but they not even for the associate they are more for the managers. Don't work here it's rated top 10 most horrible place to work and they are closing this is why half they employees are gone trust me I know what I'm talking about go in there any day of the week u will see how dead it is in the place. They don't respect you they will start off friendly but become pricks once you get to know them no one that currently workers here wants to be there. I don't recommend Noone to work here."
bad,"Although the employees were great, I would have to say management was bad. They don't respect their employees. We were pressured to ""sign up"" clients to our rewards program or to register for a credit card. The pressure unfortunately makes the customer experience unfortunate."
bad,"As a Custodial supervisor I not only had to assign tasks to my employees, but I had to resolve inner conflicts, speak with store personnel who were not often pleasant or forgiving; and manage the payroll."
bad,When I worked with Sears it was not a good place to work for. I became pregnant and I was denied a restroom break or a snack break which made me have utis and kidney problems making me go on bed rest 1 month before my child was born
bad,"This was by far the worst job I have ever had. I worked for Kmart for many years and went back thinking things had changed. The management is very unprofessional. Some of the workers only were there to collect a check. The customer service is awful. No one tried to help the customers, and it is still like that today. The cashiers were trained how to do their jobs, and they did not do it correctly. There were rules for certain people. This job is for high school students. It is not for anyone who has a family."
bad,Quality and brand is a concern not only within the merchandise but within the culture itself.  People deserve better treatment.
bad,it was good in the beginning and than everything changed and everyone went running for the hills. wish it was going downhill like it is.
bad,"Typical day at work is very boring.  Not a lot of customers. I learned about parts and working with customers "" the good and the bad"". I don't trust the management at all. My co workers are great, I have bonded with a few of them. I will miss working with them. Not a hard part of the job, some times its challenging because things change a lot in the parts department and basically at Sears in general. I enjoy working at putting the parts away and most of the customers are great. Unfortunately its the rotten mean customers that you really remember."
bad,A typical work day is very stressful. i learned how to put the customers first. the managers are only out for themselves.my co-workers are great. dealing with the delivery team dealing with delivery issues. The most enjoyable part of my day is woring with my co-workers.
bad,horrible place to work. bad hours. bad management. bad pay. bad training. bad pay. the people who work there are in high school. the management usually doesn't know what they are talking about. they only care about credit goals.
bad,"Sears is a terrible company to work for and their continue to get worse. I was a Service writer for the auto center and my day was filled with dealing with technicians and attempting to sell un-needed products and services to customers. I would have to work with equipment that was from the 1990's and a system that would freeze and frequently shut down. Management was the worst part of the job. I constantly went to them with problems that needed to be fixed, for example the computers and were never fixed. But what was so terrible about management was them pestering us about pushing services that were way over charged and that you could get for half the price across the street, by them making us push services it actually made customers turn services they did need down. On top of everything the auto center manager at my location was not doing his job and would put his duties onto me and the other associates, Their was no way for me to get ahold of his manager which was the district manager and would only come in once every 6 months. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting some nice people. To top it all off i was paid $7.25/Hr which is below minimum wage but they tried to justify it by me also making commission which is minimal."
bad,I really hated this job. Will never come back. Management isn't that bright. I left this job without any noticed for a month and came back for a week and left again.
bad,"No support from Store manager, controlled by people above him. Workload heavy and the pay is terrible. They have forgotten what taking care of the customer means."
bad,Managers were hired with minimal experiance and left unchecked promotions were base on politics with no regard for performance based Long hours without any regnitionn programs
bad,"Like the other reviews for back room, this place sucks. Its so unorganized and unprofessional. The new lead is absolutely terrible. He has no idea what hes doing and is completely disrespectful to all of his employees. As soon as he started the entire backroom had to carry his dead weight and he even had the audacity to say he was going to have every body fired except for two other employees because we weren't good enough. Upper management was no better, way high expectations and low respect. I couldn't even get a drink of water without one of them coming back and telling us we couldn't that we weren't allowed to do so. Neither of the top two managers could even get my name right ever, from my first day to my last. I recommend not working here until the holiday season when hours actually open up."
bad,Absolutely the worst job I have ever had. The company is run terrible and needs to get away from the full line store's issues. Terrible management and they will take advantage of their employees in order to do less work for themselves.
bad,This company will be gone within the next 2 to 5 years. Sears use to be a great company until the new CEO took over and drove it into the ground
bad,Management was bad and I heard it is still bad. Always a chip over your shoulder because you didn't know if you would be fired for anything.
bad,"My typical day consisted of running merchandise pickup and locating stock. Other days would consist of building grills or cleaning the back room. On Fridays the entire day would consist of emptying the truck, organizing it, and running merchandise pickup. At least that is what it was when I started. Near the end of my time being there, I would just stand at merchandise pickup and do nothing (For hours on end) until a pickup arrived. The new back room lead was so worried about bad timings on our pick ups he had me just stand there instead of helping out or even do my job properly. "
bad,I was laid off when I was best sales associate they had. The store was run horribly by the management. The store did a horrible job at making sales and providing a comfortable environment for the employees or customers.
bad,"Sears expects you to give 275% every day, for 10 hour shifts, but pays you like a door greeter at Wallmart. My salary, when translated to hourly, is less than $8 per hour."
bad,"Wait on customers, restock merchandise, online orders, management did not help you when busy, did managers job not compensated  for it. did cashiering, loved my co -workers. Hardest part was no appreciation from management or help. Work with the customers"
bad,"Deceptive, management allows employees to steal payments from fellow associates, allows harrasment by associates and management, lies to unemployement officials, I requested family leave to care for my mother in november of 2014, and was denied because black friday was coming up, I told them I would work through black friday, and then they fired me on 12/2/2014, my mother passed away on 12/27/14."
bad,"Not enough hrs & discrimination, management is bad, micro mangers. attendance policy is bad everything is bad. No way to get an higher position. Nothing to make you happy working for sears"
bad,store closed up. company is falling apart but doing great at online sales. company need to figure out how to draw more customers into the stores
bad,It was a job to get me through school.  I really do not wish to discuss the people that were there. The place has closed since then and I would like to leave it closed.
bad,Sears is a dying company and the way they treat their employees sure shows it. As an unofficial rule employees are scheduled 8 hours a week and paid bi-weekly. When a store closes employees are at risk of losing their benefits. Raises are dream.
bad,"this employer only cares about the numbers. They want a number whether or not it is true.  They have falsely reported my reviews when I had not received one because they are required to give one every month, and reported counts when there were none because without counts the store will look bad.  There is looking the other way when rules are not adhered to and no loyalty from them for good employees; some employees get a lot of shifts while others get nothing."
bad,"I worked at Sears for 4 months and had learned all the operations of my dept. which included, tools(both power and hand), lawn and garden(mowers and their attachments and hand and power equipment), and fitness equiopment.  I strived myself to be the best and most knowledgable,  i achieved that in 2 months, and management decided not to promote me even tho there was an opening available that i qualified for.  They promise $25/hr and thats a lie you make $6/hr + commission and having a sales day of over $10k i got $500 in commision for 2 weeks which was a total of $25k in sales the commission is ridiculous because all of what makes the money there is selling stuff people dont want because of the insane price they sell it for and its unnecessary.  The other downside is that you have about 12 different ""metrics"" or stats you have to meet every single day and if you do not meet them even one they will write you up."
bad,Good for experience but not a good permanent place for employment. Great for students and younger crowd. Look for other places.
bad,Sears might be the worst retail company i have worked with so far.  They do not show respect for their employees or even their members for that matter.  The rights of workers are violated often with impunity. I am ready to work for a company that values me and my fellow associates.
bad,"Horrible, short hours, long commute, very fast paced work, 2 employees per 15 customers average with items that either don't scan correctly or are in abundance."
bad,"I worked as a Cashier at Sears for two years too long and did not have a pleasant working experience there whatsoever. My specific location was always busy with NEVER ENOUGH HELP. There were always long lines because there was only ONE cashier per station (M-F) and for each customer you had to go through the never-ending process of getting their email, signing them up for rewards, offering credit cards, etc. A simple transaction took ten minutes, which was not good for either the customers waiting in line or the cashier; customers would become irritated/impatient and the cashier is stressed because there is literally no help no matter how many times you page over the intercom. But, doesn't matter, because ""you need to drive your numbers."" Being understaffed was ALWAYS an issue.  Managers would hide in the office unless they are out collecting your numbers (how many people you signed up for rewards and credit cards). "
bad,"The managers and leads are probably the worst thing about this store. No advancements, No communication, No opportunities just simple favoritism and SYW and Credit pushers. I've been at sears for months and already new people are getting payed more than me. Wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"understaffed and overworked, no job security. higher management is unprofessional and basis. do not recommend any one to apply here"
bad,"The absolute worst company that I have ever worked for in 25 years of warehousing. Employees go home in 8 or 10 hours while the management team works 14 to 16 days. If the employees don't finish their work before the shift ends, then management MUST finish it. Management is often brought in on weekends to do hourly work, with no hourly employees present. There is no morale, teamwork, brainstorming or any other kind of problem solving to mention here. Avoid this company like the plague, unless your entry level. Then you will see how a warehouse is NOT supposed to be run and you can use this knowledge when you start looking for another job after a few months of working here"
bad,"Work hard, and be compensated little. Management only cares about credit card signs up and memberships."
bad,Will look over your shoulder the whole workday will show favoritism and will hire completely incompetent management and will schedule horrible hours just bad all around
bad,Would be hesitant to recommend SHC as a long term career opportunity.  Much of the industry is moving to 'on-line' businesses.  Big box stores will continue to struggle against the like of Amazon.
bad,honestly betters places then there! not worth the pay no raises managers are awful there first job yes but no carer there honestly!
bad,"I don't know where to start, Sears pretends like they care about there employees and then when they make a mistake no matter how trivial, they treat them like a criminal. They took advantage of me because I'm an immigrant, I was the top cashier with 4 times as many credit card sign ups as anyone else. Credit Cards with High interest is the number one thing they care about. They put you under tremendous pressure to get people to sign up, even if you know it will hurt people. Trying to do what they demand I sometimes would give them a coupon for a discount if they signed up.   They literally fired me because I helped people by giving them coupons !!! No kidding, coupons, I didn't even know it was against the rules ! Why can't I give a customer a store coupon ? they put them for free in the paper and online. Then they made me write what I had done wrong, telling what to say, I didn't even understand that it was so they could justify firing me. I only wonder what there real reason was ? I just can't believe it wasn't personal for some reason. A coupon ? I was there top cashier and the costumers loved me. I can't believe that they tricked me into signing a paper stating that I did something wrong, that's what really hurts, I was a great honest employee and they tricked me."
bad,Worked for this company for alittle bit. Management was absolutely horrible and can not keep employees to save their lives. Don't be honest either because they do not care. Associates steal time and the managers over look it just because they are making money.
bad,Really really super super duper duper uber bad management at this location. Really super duper uber bad pay rate and just bad
bad,"Management plays dumb to ongoing issues, no training outside of several hundred videos that don't pertain to your job, no place for advancement, favoritism."
bad,"- I worked for Sears for two years and I believe they disrespected me in the end."
bad,"Sears and Kmart are the worst company to work for. They put too much pressure on the associate having to meet 5 different metrics. Even if you try and don't hit all your numbers they will fire you. If they don't like you, they will find a reason to fire you. Management is terrible. They don't treat an associate like a human being but a number. They cut all hours across the board because yes they will be going out of business. There is no job security at all. They could close the doors like many Sears and kmarts across the state and not tell you. They downsized stores making them look terrible. They don't care about your home life especially if your a manager. They will make you work fifteen hours a day because they can't afford the associates more hours. The store management will treat their managers horrible. They undermine them in front of supervisors and associates. It is a terrible place to work for. Eventually they will close the doors"
bad,"By far currently  became one of the worst employers ever especially sense they took the raises away.  Everybody is either quitting or getting laid off.  No hours.  Very disrespectful and don'the care about their employees or their customers, just care about making a buck and paying extremely little.  I was there 7 and a half years and was only making $8.45 and was probably  doing more than anyone in the store and even had awards recognitions and busted shoplifters, and ran mostly all departments.  Work somewhere else.  You'll thank me later."
bad,"Sears was not the best place to work, very disfunctional. "
bad,"Loss Prevention could be great, if the manager isn't always out to get you, talks down on you constantly, manager is never there but still get more recognition than the LP Associates who are actually doing the work! Things need to change, and for those who think coming to this position, I would wait until a new LP manager comes aboard."
bad,"very slow work place, disrespectful staff and managers not a good place to work. i got paid 4.50/ per hour. its has very peaceful customers and their sales and promotions are very helpful."
bad,Management is very bad! They only hire you until the the end of your probation and if it is passed your probation they force you to quit!
bad,"After 14 years of loyal service, was laid off in one of many such actions by Sears. There have been many great people I worked with at this company, and for that, I am grateful.  However, the company itself has betrayed many, many people."
bad,"Regular day consists of you clocking in, looking up your numbers (your sales in credit cards and percentage in signing customers up for memberships). Cashing customers out and trying to pitch to them to get a credit card or sign up for the store membership. If you don't get customers to sign up for a credit card each of your shift, most likely your hours will get cut and you will receive harsh treatment from management. Management however is disorganized, rude, and lazy. Only care about themselves and if employees are trying to sell the store credit cards. They fail to realize that some people do not want credit cards and we are in no position to force them to get one. You're better off being a sales associate or a back room associate, but either what your gonna get f*cked over by management. Management shows lots of favoritism and do not have flexible hours. Have no consideration for employees in school or when someone needs to change their availability (they will fire you or cut your hours if you do so also) Cashiers are usually being forced to do other people's jobs, such as makes breaks which is the managements job and also training new hires which is also managements job. Many affairs in the company which causes Unnecessary tension. LP watches the employees more than they than they do the customers that just come in and swipe a bunch of clothes in thier bag. Company is going out of business soon due to VERY poor customer service and lack of quality in material. Even the mangers have gotten poor reviews from customers, not worth working for especially if you have kids, bills"
bad,"This company is hanging on by a thread.  They preach that they hire veterans and support the cause, but when it comes right down to it they don't.  I worked for them full time for almost 2 years and was called into the management's office and let go without notice.  Their excuse was that my job was not longer needed at the store.  "
bad,"Sears is a Landmark company. It exists since 1787. Ivwas hoping to find people with values and decent behavior. Not everyone at Sears is a monster, but the call center is contaminated with level people."
bad,always provide  training for the advancement of the employees every year to produce quality workers and effective employees
bad,"Field rep outside dealing with Sears Home Improvement clients that had work done."
bad,"I started my part time job as a sales associate.  I did well for the first few months.  I ranked number one in the nation for customer service in my department.  I ranked in the the top third percentile of sales in my department."
bad,"The Irondequoit Mall decline obviously effected  Sears' business, the Company has poured resources into saving the Store but with no avail."
bad,"from day one you can tell it's a sinking ship. Badly behaved co workers and management. Toxic environment. One sales person called another's wife ugly, whose response was to pull a knife and threaten to kill him. They both kept heir jobs. I was almost on a fist fight over $0.30 Commission I accidentally stole. It was the second incidence of violence that my co worker had been invoked in, they still kept their job. They need to be gone from the Canadian busness landscape, terrible company."
bad,"Manager always ditched work in the middle of the day, super slow all day, no room for advancements, no benefits for part time work. You stand around all day and do absolutely nothing. You have to sell credit and if you dont, they decide they dont like you."
bad,"If you don't get like 10 people a day to sign up for the sears card you get fired, I ended up quitting and while I was there so many people got fired for it"
bad,"Very challenging place to work, no elan, no esprit d'corp or commeradie. Raises are far and few in between and then literally only pennies. Every decision is governed by the company's performance matrix which at times causes good customer service to go by the wayside; you don't want negatives, like replacing a defective appliance, on your score card."
bad,was not a fun place to work for worked everybody to much and alone. there is never an associate on the floor because the company cannot afford to pay people to work for them.
bad,"I worked for this company for last couple years and i don't have nothing nice to say. I was part of MP Team, it was fun place to work when we had a good leader, nice, friendly and approachable person somebody who knows her job. She left and somebody else took over and everything went downhill and your job started to be very stressful, people started to quit, job can't be done because they don't have people or new people don't have proper training and they don't know what to do, but there is no understandings from management, they keep their eyes closed or their going call you to the office for a lecture, hours are very bad one shift per week or two, MPT starts their shift at 5 a.m. not fun at all, Thursday is signs day and it is a horrible day, you can't go for break or home until signing is done and because they don't have people that takes time, no wonder nobody wants to stay. no hours, bad management, horrible leader, very pushy, not friendly, not approachable, rude, a lot of work waiting to be done but they don't have hours or people. So my point is spare yourself a lot of stress and go find somewhere else same job because It is not worth it..sorry Sears."
bad,"This is not a jewelry job. Sears is not a viable company. The commission payout is subject to change and 50 of what you sell is from other departments. Of what you sell in jewelry, about 50 does not pay commission. Store management is not professional and care only about the auto center and appliances. The store is dirty and leadership in the jewelry department consist of egomaniacs. The jewelry is poorly made and cheap."
bad,"poor pay, nasty co-workers, bad hours, no communication, boring, too pushy with credit card apps, too much competition"
bad,Ne sais jamais si nous aurons du travail le lendemain. Aucun avancement possible.
bad,"Wow this job started off as the best job ever. Right out the box I went out selling.. getting awards and making great money were talking 5k- 7k per week then about 3 months in they start playing games and stop paying you stating that your jobs didn't get installed for this or that.. they don't have enough installers.. so your jobs get canceled and they reverse all your commissions leaving you to either work for free or owing them the money they fronted you on the jobs... "
bad,I counted the cash register every morning. I ask people to apply for a sears card and shop your way rewards. I put out new merchandise and re-arranged the departments for the different seasons.
bad,"Sears lies, cheats and steals from employees and customers with bogus warranties, totally incompetent technicians and failures for managers."
bad,"Very poor morale in the Stores.  Most Stores look half empty as they have discontinued so many lines.  The Staff have not had a raise in almost ten years,"
bad,Sear's is a black hole. Only purpose is to being people and good energy down. The managers do not do there work properly an push it off to other non manager employees. Sear's manager teach the employees a quicker way to give the customer a coupon and later turned on an employee and is currently being sued for letting corporate now what happen. Sear's is not the company for any human-being.
bad,"I believe the best part of working at Sears is the comradery that can be achieved with your co-workers. The worst part is the complete lack of incentives, lack of common sense, poor leadership and management."
bad,"-no advancement"
bad,"This is a nightmare company to work for the manager has no problem treating employees  like the are idiots and talking to the employees like you are dirt. The HR manger is s horrible person and has no clue to what she is doing. You will be worked with no days off amd basically no breaks. As a matter of fact you will be scheduled at best 6 and a halfhours they. do this so that they don't have to give you a lunch break and you will get only one 15 minute break. You will be worked to death and then they will let you go. I would not reccomend getting a job here  especially if it is a first job "
bad,people were nice but everthing was crazy there no one really looked like they knew what to do the managment was not good and pay was very small.
bad,"Crooked, crooked, crooked.  "
bad,Sears pay scale is among the worst and the employee benefits are difficult to get. the managers are fairly clueless and sometimes it seems as if the company is trying to go bankrupt.
bad,"Kmart in Murfreesboro,  TN is very unorganized!! I started here with no training at all! The very first day I was thrown on the sales floor in the shoes department (I was hired to be a cashier) and I stayed 2 days after that and I was still not trained just told to front face the sales floor and put return items away (I had no idea where anything went)"
bad,Stressful days and nights. Barely have Sundays off. Rude management. People quitting from left to right. Get paid minimum wage to do signing and that usually starts at 7pm - sometimes 5am.
bad,"You will be overworked, not appreciated, and the company will make you leave early if you even 5 minute over 40 hours for that week, regardless of what needs to be done."
bad,Sears is inconsistent  and there are many disconnects between reps and technicians.  worked for sears technical support for 10 years and was not satisfied with the work environment.
bad,"If you apply chances are your going to get hired right on the spot, sounds great right? WRONG. They think that your super human and they set very high expectations for only $8.25. They will force you to keep a certain ""base to bonus"" ,""loyalty"", and ""Credit"" (credit you basically ruin peoples credit scores with false advertisements. If you dont meet the expectations you'll get scream at and compared to others. "
bad,"I typical day at work would result in computer problems daily, routing errors and misinformation. The repair aspect of this position was the BEST part of the job, well that and most of your fellow technicians. I love the troubleshooting and repair but the Management structure is, let's just politely say, from another planet! Worst corporate and customer/technician service I have ever experienced."
bad,"This is honestly the worst company I've ever worked for in my career. The management hired is usually internally done, but it's not done with the employees in mind."
bad,"not good with hours or days,dont ever get a raise, they lie. My co-worker are nice just management can be iffy. Hardest part of my job is nothing really, caught on fast. I learned about merchandise. good thing is the discounts you get otherwise they dont like to give fulltime or benefits"
bad,This is an okay company if you like to work alone and  without any kind of direction. i did not like this company because they very unrecognized
bad,"Little business. Varied shifts . Management did not teach me much . Co-workers were great and very helpful, however. Gave me sales experience ."
bad,"I was 100% Commission. At first I made decent money. Then they cut our commission rates bad, I had new managers all the time, Sears is doing really bad. They will shut more store down to try to make it. I worked at the Hammond store. Terrible managers!!! I walked out got tired of all the stuff and not making any money. If you don't sell enough for the week they pay you $7.25 then you have to pay it back."
bad,"I would enjoy working with my co-workers, most of the job was based on team work it made the work easier for us. we all had different responsibilities when working on merchandize..  I learnt how to open master cards and also how to promote sales that were in store.."
bad,There is a large disconnect between level of management from regional all the way down to the store level and throughout the stores their are over 15 different metrics that each associate must keep up with that ensures you have done something wrong each day you have worked.
bad,"I just quit this place after two years two days ago. I'm not saying all Sears stores are bad but the one I worked for was terrible. They won't pay much, nor do they give raises. They expect you to do so much and yet they don't appreciate you. Management plays favoritism and if they don't like you, they'll harass you until you leave. It's not worth it plus all the sears stores are closing anyway and I'm glad about it."
bad,"Sears Plaza Carolina:"
bad,"mangement was not good"
bad,"The only thing that needs to be said about this job is that the work is great, the employees are commission based which makes competition bad and rude, they teach you to be a crook with customers, and the pay is worse than volunteering."
bad,"inbound escalated department for sears holdings.  The answers vary widely dependent upon who you ask for help in the department, which makes it extremely difficult if you are new to the role.  Training was horrible."
bad,"Low salary/discrimination/bullying/"
bad,Over all the team atmosphere is there but management is no where there to support or back up and most of the time people on the floor are the ones making decisions . Store manager has no clue how to run a store or how to treat people .His poor management and under qualified skills is what is killing this store 3 year max then this store will shut down due to mismanaged and un skilled managers. Over all stay away apply for Any other retailer but this place lots of turnover and lots of  of bad decisions .
bad,I was not trained very well and there was no room for advancement I was given the worst hours so I never made any good money. they need to give the new people a shot
bad,"All of the reviews are from former employees. Sears is not the place to work for; their prices are too high and they pay the lowest commissions in the industry. Home Depot & Loews are better Companies to work for."
bad,"I work at the Humble Store for two years, and this place is so sorry that they would keep you off the schedule unless they want something until than, they would treat you like a dog."
bad,hated it hated it  hated it hated it everythings all about getting credit cards and not understanding worst place to work would not work there ever AGAIN .
bad,"Working at Sears is one of the worst places I've worked for. I have worked at two different locations and they are both the same. They have the worst pay 7.25 like honestly what bills can that pay. Secondly the West Oaks Store can't keep a store manager to save their life. The upper management is the absolute worse their rude disrespectful and if you don't kiss their butt they take away your hours. The store has a rats,roaches and all type of other animals running throughout the store. And the store manager has fired 5 people within the last 2 weeks when we only had 15 people working their to began with, you would think that they would be trying to keep as many employees as they can get. And they don't pay time off when a family member passes away due to them not being a immediate relative like anyone in your family is immediate. Sears SUCKS and need to be closed down."
bad,Enjoyed everything. No dislikes. Learned new things and gain more experience. loved learning how to price and put up walls. Solving every customer needs on daily base.
bad,"Worst management I've ever worked for. There is no respect for personal life and you basically can't have one if you work at the Heath store. Schedules are constantly changed with short notice and I do mean this is literally a daily occurrence. "
bad,They don't care about their employees. You have to run 5 departments at one time. Not enough help. No raises ever.  Not enough hours.
bad,"No order, and circus, and a chaotic environment; rookie engineers are made supervisors with no field experience and cause chaos in the field, due to their lack of experience and poor hiring on the companies part."
bad,After I was hired training was a quick walk through the store. Noted my area of responsibility and said there you go. Any formal training was after 6 month and that wasn't even productive or useful.
bad,"Little pay to do every thing in the store. I received discrimination & was bullied. I wasn't trained. They just throw you out there and expect for you to figure it out. It's not hard, but i wasn't told what to do & when I did what I thought I was suppose to do it wasn't right even though another manager said it was."
bad,"I do not recommend anyone to work for this company. No one cares about you, everyone tries to act like they are managers but they are not. Very disorganized."
bad,"Every 2 months due to the internal re-organization I had a new boss."
bad,"There was no hours,  no weekends off, 12 hour shifts,  and micromanagement. There was no training but alot of write ups for bad customer service. There was no talking allowed amongst coworkers during hours."
bad,It's all about credit card acquisition. We have been given the impression that the company will not survive unless we meet card acquisition goals. Staff are all fearful that they will be let go if they do not achieve card acquisition targets and managers are having to put staff on formal performance improvement programs if they are below standard. District office creates culture of fear and intimidation-you're always feeling like you have to look over your shoulder. This is not leadership
bad,"When I first started working at Sears it was my first sales job, so it was exciting and fun. Over the three years I worked there they changed/lowered the commision structure, and raised the sales goals. They also seemed to have some new goal or program you were supposed to promote/reach every week."
bad,"Management is a joke. Nothing ever gets done, everyone just wants to stand around and talk. Revisions take weeks for a single aisle because they only have one person on the payroll doing them. He starts one, halfway does it then starts another, leaving a huge mess in the way. Truck unloading process is a disaster, nothing is organized, they just throw things where they think they go. It's not like these people are new, they've been there for years. They should know what they're doing, but they either don't know or don't care. Probably both. Planograms are a disaster, there is no order to where things go on the shelves. They don't pay nearly enough for the stuff they wanna put us through. There isn't enough equipment for everyone to do their job, so we have to either stand around and wait for one to become available or have someone with a PDA come and do our job for us. And if you try to get a PDA when there is one, they want you to give up your keys as collateral. They treat us like middle school kids. They promote imbeciles, then expect us to take orders from those imbeciles. DO NOT WORK THERE UNLESS YOU ARE VERY VERY DESPERATE!"
bad,sears has gone from a customer service driven and associate friendly company to a focus on metrics no matter what it takes company.
bad,i felt like my life was stuck working here dont do it because i worked for a short period of time for this company during that time i was treated unfairly and constantly was switched around filling up for other cashiers.
bad,"typical day at work nothing more about this job there is nothung more to say."
bad,The managers are very rude. and they always tell you how your doing things wrong. They don't like anyone. they don't want you talking to friends while workingl
bad,"I have worked there for over 6 years and no one has ever got a raise unless minimum wage went up. They do not care about their employees at all. Everyone is replaceable in their eyes which causes them to lose the good and knowledgable employees. That is why the service is so terrible. Poorly trained staff. It is actually embarassing. Don't waste your time working here, I don't see this company lasting much longer with all the stores closing every year."
bad,"I was initially excited about this position.  I had done loss prevention before and was eager to rejoin a position that was both fun and challenging.  I was able to get an interview of which I nailed and was hired on the spot.  Upon being hired, I had to disclose some information that was important as it pertained to something personal.  I informed them that my daughter was special needs and that I there would have be times, who knows when they would happen, that I may need to leave or miss work.  Those instances should not be frequent as long as my daughter had ""good days"".  I was hired and started at the end of this past April and went through training and elearning computer exercises.  Within my first 2 weeks, I was already being given grief by what would be my LPM.  I put in a request to have a Saturday off, yes within the first month of being employed, to I could attend my own graduation from school.  Also, anyone who is able to obtain the position of an asset protection agent, has to go through what they call a certification process, which is never actually specified what the steps are, but is described as whenever you manager is comfortable in the fact that you could handle a detainment on your own.  Also of which, making a trip to Stockton what they said is a certification class that is also necessary for eligibility.  Kmart did not honor what they said at any point during my employment with the company."
bad,Management undermines and does not work well together or with their employees. They had bad attitudes and had no direction as to where they wanted the company to go. worst place to work.
bad,"Pretty simple. Operations manager for 19+ years this is the most unorganized, disfunctional group I have ever encountered. No upper management accountability, the recognition for the team members only works if the dsm makes her numbers if not pack your bags."
bad,management does not adhere to upper management guidelines for personal reasons not consistent with policy. Frequent violation of customer discount schedule regarding damaged items for sale.
bad,"typical day at work mad costumers annoyed customers."
bad,worked well with my peers creating a focused team that's priorities consisted of helping one another and customer satisfaction
bad,"The managers DID NOT care about the employees, if they did, THAT manager would quit pretty soon after starting. It's a horrible work environment with no respect. You could lift a car off a person and they would still be yelling at you for denting their bumper in the process. Completely ungrateful. The co-workers made things more bearable most of the time, work days consisted mostly of shelving things people didn't want to put away themselves and making the aisles look nice, which only lasted for maybe an hour before some negligent patron waltzed down each and every aisle with the need to pick up and but back ex. item in a place JUST BARELY where they got it from. Sick days were out of the question, if you had the black lung but had no sick days left? Tough, come in and bleed black over everyone around you or get fired. HR cared LESS than management, if that tells you anything."
bad,"This place doesn't exist anymore, but when I worked there I really did enjoy my job.  I had a lot of fun serving the customers and meeting new people.  It also trained me for other skills I could use in other places."
bad,not a good place to work for. company do not know about customer service. One manager and one csa can not work in one store need to hire more employees but refuse too.
bad,"Where to start. Management was extremely rude and constantly verbally abusive. Managment aloud workers who were their friends to sit around all day and do nothing while a select few did all the work. It started out okay, hours great work load was decent. Then they began to expect me to do more and more and more to the point I'd have task that simply couldn't be completed in one day. Then the hours started to fade away but the work continued to increase. I was given a managers job with keys to the store but was still only payed 8/h after being promised benifits, more money and more hours. It got to the point i was madw to clock out for lunch but remain in the building working (for free on my lunch) just to try and get things done, and you may ask how was i made? I just had a baby boy a few months back and have been told id i didnt finish work my job may not be there much longer, ive been looking for jobs but many require a colleg degree. Im a part time employee with keys to the building and the responsibilities of a manager but none of the benifites. The workers are lazy, I've seen many workers clock in, then walk up stairs to watch TV for 2 hours or so without a manager even batting an eye. It's a terrible place to work and soons I find a new job I'll be leaving this place, I'll never shop there and tell anyone I know how bad it is to work and shop there. Just terrible."
bad,"Ok place to work building need repairs and higher pay/ hours for employees, most of the time it was a fun environment and nice staff"
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. It was very hard working with upper management and other departments within the company..
bad,"As a commissioned sales consultant you never know what your day would be like. Fellow employees can take the sale from right under you. Management would require tons of documentation before they reverse the sale. Management spends too much time smoking outside besides taking care of customers and the lively hood of their employees. Fraternization within the store was so bad that its the only way for some people to keep their job or get promoted.You can make great money only if you have good relationship with the managemnt team, they can assist you in acquiring sales or takeover other employees sales effort."
bad,"Loved my coworkers "
bad,Sears is a family company when we have a great day we get rewarded. The competition was great because everyone was recognized for good work.
bad,I am a mca. We are under staffed and punished for not coming in to work on your off days when needed. I help the cashiers and help customers. I also put out stock give cashiers breaks when needed. I make signs set adds and do markdowns and markups
bad,"I worked in an understaffed WH and was often scheduled to work alone if you were over five minutes getting a customers package you were punished. "
bad,management sucks all they did was hound the cashiers about opening up credit card accounts for the customers and keeping our register at 100 and pressuring the customer to do feedback surveys
bad,"Unclean work environment and Management staff has been there too long.  Employees look unprofessional because they’re not uniformed.  One of the worst places I worked, and I was in Afghanistan."
bad,I was a cashier for only a few months but it was terrible. My manager was always picking on me for the smallest things. It was awful and I really don't have much else to say about the place.
bad,Customer service position that required an abundance of sales experience. Position required that you sell additional products and encourage customers to open lines of credit.
bad,"Kmart hired me and didn't put my on the actual work schedule until THREE months later.  I kept asking human resources why I have not been through orientation, this had been weeks after I was hired.  They would have me come in maybe four hours every other week and watch dvds about the company.  I needed part time work but not at the rate of a few hours every two to three weeks. They finally decided to hire six other employees after me as I guess this would be enough for a full orientation.  After completing that final phase I had to wait three more weeks to be on the schedule.  I'm sorry but that is ridiculous.  "
bad,"Not a good place to work if you like structure, a positive work environment, and management that is hands on an motivating. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with uncaring employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
bad,"The company is terrible and treats their so called ""valued employees"" like absolute garbage. Not once when i did something good was i ever told good job or i'm proud of you, no instead they just decided to belittle me for every little teeny mistake i ever made to the point of absolutely regretting ever working for company."
bad,Poor management and untimely resources. Salary bumps dependent on sales. The company is slowly going under and you feel those effects when it come to raises and such.
bad,"Bringing new merchandise onto the floor for sales, ringing customers up with their final selections. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers and I like the fact that I was able to deal with clothing, shoes, customers, perfume, and cash."
bad,not a company for advancement they will put more responsibility on you and no more pay. lateral advancement more work and headache with the same amount of pay
bad,preventative maintenance. I learned that there is a reason they couldn't keep customers. management was awful and unwilling to help. co-workers were rude and hard to communicate with. hardest part of the job was knowing there was no way to advance.
bad,"try to keep employees on task to keep the department running at a positive speed."
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely unproductive. Management does not care about your work, they only care about their paychecks. My co-workers all, but three, had horrible attitudes. No one was ever on time, and no one cared about what they were doing. Customers were always dissatisfied, and ,no one has any interest in moving you up if you are doing a good job, they're happy keeping you where you are at minimum wage, which is not, in any way worth it. The hardest part of the job was waking up every morning knowing I had to go back in. The most enjoyable part of the job, was my trainer, because he was one of three co-workers with a good attitude."
bad,"The day started out with obtaining the cash for the register and recounting it before placing it in the register.  This was followed by a brief meeting where management told us how things were going and if there was anything special happening that day."
bad,"Company is going through major changes.  Company wide layoffs, store closings, and employee transfers.  No job within the company is secure at this time."
bad,"No benefits, no raises and hardly any hours!! the only benefit was being paid weekly. Typical day as a cashier included ringing up customers and bagging their items."
bad,the company is a two face store that is cheap on the labour . and the bosses don't know what they are doing. and they don't tell you if your on contract or not so don't quit your other job
bad,company is going nowhere fast. no one seems to know what they are doing. managers lack ambition and creates lack of morale from the employees that work for them
bad,"I worked for the portrait studio which is not owned by sears. it is now out of business because, in my opinion, it was run poorly. The cash register was using a program from '95 and would often completely stop working for entire days. horrible experience."
bad,I applied for a job at KMart through Sears Holding and its a gimmick. Applying justs opens you up to unwanted job advisory telemarketers harrassing you as well as further education telemarketing. Your email gets bombed with several positions you can apply for. Never heard a thing about the. original application I submitted. Waste of time
bad,"its really hard to work with sears. bad hours and not pay you enough. its really bad and weak company prices, co workers, managers,"
bad,"They start out paying minimum and expct maximum output. Its not unskilled work just really undervalued, especially by management.Co workers were really great though. If you stick around and fight for raises they'll come."
bad,"started working and was hired to do offline work when we were caught up with the quota that the seniority employees were behind in we were told we would not be affected to be moved to a different dept but instead as soon as we hit out 90 day probation the next day were told we had to be transferred to a new dept. because of our stats which we had none because we were technically in our training 90 day probation and due to the seniority employees that refused and huffed and puffed we had no choice. worst place I have ever worked at, and the management did not help with days off or needed schedule changes."
bad,"I quit my job with sears at the parks mall in Arlington. The managers were always negative and divided the cashiers like we were in gangs.  If they don't like you they  give you less hours, and you can forget about any kind of promoting, the general manger offered me one and just kept dragging it out for over a year! I quit because it was too stressful, I never had a weekend off , if I called in I was harassed by the Cashier lead and told several times by her that if I call in I'll be fired for insubordination. Please save yourself the stress and find another job.. Try Macy's, at least their not going broke."
bad,"Sears needs alot to improve. My experience is horrible. I would never recommend anyone to work at this company. The management horrible, Job Culture horrible, Job Security horrible, Overall HORRIBLE. but i made good money for my first job"
bad,The company does not treat there employees fairly. They wanted me to do my supervisors job while he got paid to do it. They offered me promotions and would take it away at the last minute.
bad,Part time hours. Raises are often frozen. Start a minimual wage and the benefits is more of a discount than an insurance policy.
bad,I was brought in and laid off inside of a year. I didnt know the company was hurting as bad as it was otherwise I would have passed on this opportunity. I wish them well.
bad,"Not a great place to work.  No chance for advancement."
bad,"Nothing To Much To Say About Sears, This job was Seasonal, Worked Here a Month or Two. I Unloaded Trucks and Stocked Tools.. I learned that The Prices of Tools are Very High but Very Much So Needed. Didn't Work There Long Enough To Really Mingle or Get a Get Sense Of My Co Workers; Don't Even Remember Anybody that Was There. The Job Wasn't Hard at All, But Cant Really Remember anything Enjoyable About It Either."
bad,"I have never been more disrespected and poorly treated anywhere else, Truly upsetting how unprofessionally Sears conducts their business."
bad,"Was not a great place to work, did not learn anything of value to help me on my career path.  Had no organization and structure."
bad,"When I first stared, Sears didn't seem so bad. But the longer I worked there, the more progressively worse the company got. They have a lot of shady business practices. Terrible hours. Terrible training. As a cashier, I was told I was going to be transferred to one department, only to be told the next week that I was being given an entirely different job (mattress sales) so I worked hard to do well at that. But then after the holidays they ran out of cashiers because everyone quit and dumped me right back into being a cashier (which is of course a much lower paying job with no commission.) Turnover is huge because they pay/train terribly and mostly only hire high school-age people who don't really need the job in the first place. They put a HUGE emphasis on pushing their credit cards on people, when in reality they are really bad cards that people DO NOT need. I felt like no matter how hard I tried to do well helping customers and being a good cashier, nothing was good enough if you weren't pushing their awful credit metrics.Do yourself a favor, avoid working for Sears at all costs."
bad,The management only cares about themselves. Working the back room the system always goes down. Your told 30+ hours but you will only get maybe 20 hours. You have to do your job plus everyone else's job as well. My advice no matter how much you need a job don't take this job working for this company. This job is more for high school kids and NOT for people with kids or a wife because you will not ever get to spend time with them.
bad,"I was hired with limited information about the sales conditions of the store. There are few customers, mostly retired people. Big ticket customers would not buy unless there was a big discount sale price.  Thus the sales price and commission was 30 to 60% of regular price.  Commission sales associates, at least in the furniture department, live on minimum wage most of the time."
bad,"•	Replenish and stock shelves"
bad,Typical day at work best described as a mess. I learned a lot of patience and that management was only there to tell you your not good enough. I also learned a lot about dealing with all sorts of people and expectations when you enter a customers home.
bad,if you like commission base salary then this is the place for you. i not a commission person. and the CEO was jerk. i would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Working 6 years  company very hard working no raise! ! No advanced  moving up ..very  un organized it's good for part time people who is In school
bad,"Different shift every week "
bad,"I was with sears for about 3 years i learned about tires and maintenance on most vehicles. Management i would say was easy on us very easy work."
bad,Mangers Constantly along with procedures of the job. Overworked with no work life balance making it difficult to do anything outside of the job the progress in your career and life.
bad,"The best thing that could be done to sears auto in Fairbanks is to close it."
bad,The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing - the department managers tell the store manager what to do. The store manager is a push over. The department managers are unprofessional. Hours suck. Employment there is a huge waste of time. Save yourself.
bad,"Sears, is a business that is constantly closing down departments in the call center and sending them to the Philippines to pay less to workers. Sears, has awful training and knowledge in sales."
bad,"i have never been properly trained at sears, i have asked for help many times over only to be talked down to and punished for trying to be a better member of the staff. favoritism is a huge thing with the management. co workers get away with things i get yelled at extremely harsh for. (due to my lack of training i didnt had no idea how to respond to the situations that were happening) it all started with the store manager allowing me to have a 217 dollar sale taken from me which put my following pay check -217 dollars when by company rule it should never have been allowed. i went into this job loving it, i became a sales associate and things drastically went down hill. you are a number to be met without the help of the management staff. as long as you are a friend of the managers you are in good hands however. i warn anyone looking to join the sears staff to please look else where. i have seen many others go through the same problems i have only to leave the store crying daily. the store manager does not care about you as a person. i am currently trying to leave this job and i cannot wait for the day i can. you make 6 dollars an hour and are expected to make the rest up in sales. however you only make 1/2 - 1% commission on anything you sell making it very hard to even make minimum wage."
bad,"Co workers were bitter, Manager does nothing all day, Get annoying customers, Not enough hours, No overtime. I wouldn't recommend a teenager to work there"
bad,"When hired, I was told my guaranteed hours would be 6am-2pm every day. I was good with that as it would allow me to pay for rent, food etc with some ease. However, me and everyone else on my floor, were lucky to work until 11am. Thats a best of 5 hours, when I was promised 8hour days. The paychecks didn't come close to what I had expected or even needed, and the second I got another job, I had to take it."
bad,The work environment was great. The location was close to home.  Everybody was a team player. I enjoyed helping customers.
bad,"Sears does not give any benefits unless u buy in yourself, no competitive wages as it says, over work you and you need to buy your own clothes, what they call a uniform."
bad,"My typical day at work was opening the jewelry department,  counting the drawer and then taking inventory of the jewelry that went in the cases.  The management could have been better.  The co workers were not friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were not happy and the most enjoyable there wasn't any"
bad,"I was only at this company for 5 weeks, and in 5 weeks I feel like I learned enough about this company to say that they are no good. The trainer was scatterbrained and cared more about teaching us about her personal life, kids and husband. When everyone got to the call floor for nesting nobody knew how to do anything because we were not trained properly. The management is pathetic when it comes to issues such as harassment or other things. $11 an hour is NOT enough to put up with the stuff you have to put up with. I do not recommend this job to anyone unless you are on the verge of going homeless and starving. I quit after such a short period of time and moved to the job I'm at now because it was just not worth keeping. The pay is horrible, management is horrible and the job itself sucks. Don't waste your time applying at this nuthouse! To prove my point all 16 people who were in my training class no longer work there... do I really need to say anything else after that? If that doesn't convince you not to apply here well then, you are stupid! If you accept a job here don't say I never told you so."
bad,"The only thing I can say I loved about sears is being able to get things on a discount and sometimes free if I have enough rewards. Working there stressed me out to the point of having panic attacks! They are always on your back about numbers and if you do not exceed what they expect of you, you get let go! Not everyone likes to receive emails everyday for rewards and not everyone wants to have a credit card or apply for one because they know they will not get approved! I had to leave or I would have ended up in the hospital."
bad,"Bad manners managers very unprofessional, always have a snotty attitude towards their employees. If a emergency comes up you can't leave/call off work, your life is about Sears. Always have to get customers to sign up for stuff which the customers don't want. Pay rate is bad, the location area is bad, and very unorganized. Always have to play favorites with the mangers. Can't even go home if you're sick. Worse job  ever."
bad,"This company honestly has been the worst experience I've ever had.  Their HR department is outsourced and offers no support because employees in HR read from a script and are not able to really assist you with any concerns or grievances. While I understand the nature of retail- the expectation is that you work 11:00 PM on thanksgiving night for at least a ten hour shift and return to work later the day after to then complete another 8-10 hour day.   Very poor quality of life conditions. Department managers are sometimes very passive aggressive and sadly there are some absolutely wonderful employees who are just with the wrong company."
bad,"after spending time at this company I learned 2 things: 1, they don't care about their customers. I have witnessed multiple account where the company will intentionally provide bad experience to customers who were buying cheaper products then the ones the managers wanted to sell. 2, they don't care about their employees. There have been several situations where sales reps who were getting paid almost solely on commission were told to work as a cashier where they don't get paid. Employees were also told to come in on hours they were not scheduled when sears was understaffed and if the employee was not available they were punished. worst. company. ever!!!!!!"
bad,Team meeting about numbers who is not meeting quotas and dealing with rough and angry customers due to various reasons.  Just a job i would not like to ever have to experience again
bad,"Don't work here,  don't do it.  Not enough hours,management don't know who you are,  short you on hours on your pay check then when you confront them about it they call the police have you removed from there and fire you.  Kmart is a joke and needs shut down"
bad,This company treats there workers like dogs and haves no respect for anyone. They want to work you till you are almost dead and pay you nothing. They having you running all round the store working in every department and wont pay you the difference in the departments. They also want you to clock out for breaks and lunch's but make you work while being on them as well. If there is no one else in the department the managers wont cover your breaks at all.
bad,Not a positive work environment. Employees are not treated as a valued member. Would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,"Was an electronic associate at sears. They would pay $6/HR plus commission. Problem there is the daily sales goal would be impossible to meet. Not only that but you had to sign EVERYONE up for a stupid rewards program, on top of that sell additional warranties, delivery, and installation. If you couldn't meet these numbers they made sure to tell you ""maybe this isn't the right job for you"". I laugh because they want us to sell yet we could not order more product and the only items we got in was a small ups box once a week with a few items in it. We had maybe 5 put of 45 tv's in stock, the rest were not available to order!  Oh and they wanted you to come in THREE HOURS BEFORE STORE OPENS and RESET PLANOGRAM and MAKE SIGNS!! Oh I didn't mention, they have no merchandise team or signing team.... THAT'S YOU! By the way, if you do come in THREE HOURS BEFORE the STORE OPENS, you will only be making $6/HR. This place is a joke and this company is in such denial! STOP WORRYING ABOUT PROTECTION PLANS, START WORRYING ABOUT WHY THERE ARE ZERO CUSTOMERS AND YOU'RE USING A 1989 IBM REGISTER? Oh and credit card apps got to get at least 4 a month! Or again, better look for another job!"
bad,"To be honest one of the worst places to work management was terrible was not trying to give raises ,benefits. Never had a enjoyable day coming into work didn't learned anything.Co-workers weren't bad they all felt the same way i did."
bad,pretty much felt like i was there maid.Did everything from put clothes away to dust to sweeping when someone did not want to do something i did it.
bad,I worked for this company for almost 2 years. There was no pay increases except when minimum wage went up.  I was doing my job as well as filling in for the manager in my department because she resigned and I was not compensated for all of my work.
bad,"i worked for sear more appalaince to and from the back of the warehouse and bring it to the show floor, wipe them down, make sure they wasn't scape up, and help customer take them to the car"
bad,"The company is horrible, know growth, pay sucks, no raises, over worked managers. No clear culture. Store level out dated buildings, brands. Needs remodel."
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about you and pays you less that what you deserve then this is the job for you.
bad,"Instead of trying to make things better, The stores are run down and tired looking. Many empty shelves in the stores. Turnover at HQ iss high. Instead of simplifying processes so they work, they operate in a manner that makes them morecomplicated."
bad,I did not like working at sears. Priorities there are backwards. they expect to many credit apps for being in such a small town. It was not pleasant working there.
bad,Not enough pay. Not enough advancement. Too much mess. There is no raises. Not enough opportunity for associates to come up. .
bad,This is where you go to end your career. The CEO and execrative management team has no clue on how to turn this organization around.
bad,Poor place to work. If you love drama this is the place for you. If you love lazy egotistical management work here. I work here and the hours are so awful and management only cares about credit apps. If you want to see real reviews google it. You will see hundreds and thousands of people saying the same thing. I'm actually shocked sears has such a high rating
bad,Unfortunately I have nothing positive to say about this company. It has a great brand that is being destroyed slowly by a hedge fund manager and clear incompetence from the top down.
bad,Included dealing with public and selling clothes.Also putting out back stock and straightening. ksdbiwfijwg wiiwuf wihufiuwehg whiwhh iuhiufijwigi w iwh iwi whfu
bad,horrible too much b.s too much talking behind backs broken promises treated unfair was hard to balance work and school. totally unprofessional my boss came onto me in a wrong way
bad,"terrible place to work, absolutely no room for advancement.  I was actually using a computer running windows 98. and that was the new one. after the last one has a virus that I pointed out to the manager when I started and was somehow blamed for.  DO NOT WORK FOR SEARS."
bad,"Its not a job that one can make a living off of. its a better second job. Maybe it depends on the branch but hours were never an issue to get, it was time off that was."
bad,Unfortunately Sears isn't the same company that our parents and grandparents loved.  Quite a bit of change to the point that several high profile employees have recently left company.
bad,N/A. Why and how its important to you is beyond me. My experiences at the companies I worked at are my own and confidential.
bad,no never work there. bad management. they treat employees bad. they care more about money than people. not a safe building to work in.
bad,"Great place to work but beware of lost prevention, they have quotas to meet and will lie and make up stories to get you terminated. I've seen many innocent people get terminated because of the lost prevention manager making up scenario's of how an associate did something unintentionally when it was directed to do so but nobody owns up to their faults in the management world at Sears. They will also plant items in random places to see what associates will do with it.if they see u pick it up they will have video of it but will miraculously not have the video of you putting it a way and then it'll be your word against theirs!  Their main goal is to catch associates stealing not customers! Just be overly cautious because they are dirty wanna be cops in lost prevention."
bad,"Sears is one of the worst place anyone can work for. The sears that I use to work for is in North canton, ohio or belden village mall. Sears will always be hiring all year around. That should clue people into thinking its a very disorganize work environment and people quit very easily. Every employee gets minimum pay with no full time and no benefits. I am not surprise this company is shutting down and why so many people quit all the time. At least four managers have quit within the first 6 months that I have worked at sears. My old boss had a love affair with one of the manager.  The few managers that still work there do not know what they are doing. I am so sick and tire of stupid people getting hire in to become a manager and they do not know anything about their job position. Instead they give good workers like me and many other people their job to do. The work schedules are always mess up. You could hardly ever request time off. And when you go ask them about requesting time off they yell at you. The projects at sears will never be done on time. You can forget about organization. It does not exist at sears anymore. When you need help with something (credit cards, payments, account look up, confidential information, etc.) the managers are rarely there to help you with it. My useless boss does not know how to do his job instead he just sits in his office and give everyone a hard time. He does not know how to do anything in the store. The only thing he does yell at people.  I can ramble forever about how horrible sears is. It is a good thing I do not work there anymore and"
bad,"A typical day involved processing UPS and online orders; managing the inventory; unloading trucks; training new associate and helping customers load merchandise into their vehicles.  Management was the worst I have seen in my 40 year career in multiple industries. They did not plan or communicate well, or provide direction and guidance. I learned how the retail industry worked from the ground up. I had the pleasure of working with some great and dedicated people who took ownership of the processes they performed in spite of not being appreciated for their efforts.The hardest part of the job was working short staffed and the high turnover. I enjoyed the people  "
bad,Never again. Company does not care about customers or employees. The only concern of them is credit apps. The employees are great people.
bad,"I do not get many hours at all, and never know what to expect when it comes to the shifts I will work. I clean and stock merchandise and ring customers up at the register."
bad,Worse place I've ever been employed. Management is horrible. Management can't give you a cut and dry answer on anything. The pay is insulting. They do not ever give enough hours to complete a job then wonder why the job has not been finished in its entirety.
bad,credit card and cashier experience as well as customer service experience. closing and counting registers at the end of the day.
bad,"Dont ever work here, they do nothing to make you want to stay, no room for advancement, company is sinking financially and make cuts focused towards employees"
bad,"Your entire day is based off of how many credit cards you sell during the day, not how well you treat your customers and work with your team members. I would not recommend this place for employment."
bad,Worst company to work for.  Complete incompetence from top to bottom and the pay does not make up for the lack of organization.  The company has no direction and will fail eventually.
bad,"I'm a very hard working person and I like to just do my job. I'm not into complaining over assigned tasks because at the end of the day you get paid BUT!... Sears is by far the worst company to work for. You are either on their KA list or naughty list. They do shady things to customers and their product quality is horrible. They try and get you hyped up when you sell a lot and give you coupons for free snacks like a granola bar lol but the moment you don't sell they are on to you. The store manager has her favorite employees and again it is employees that like to be on the ""K A"" list and 99.9% they won't ever leave that store or get promoted. I didn't know she was the store manager until after 6 months! LP acts as if they are the FBI and try to intimidate you for no reason. Pay is $6.50 plus 3% of commission which is a joke! If a customer returns something then you get that commission taken OFF YOUR NEXT CHECK!. They fire people for ""violating policy"" yet they do the same exact things all the time and tell you that its okay you can do that. Now this comes from MANAGEMENT!. I'm in college and due to that and my husband working as well, I needed to change my availability. They had a huge problem with that and was told that if I couldn't close twice a week I would have to ""Voluntary quit"" and yet they say they support the troops!. Also some people think that because they've been there for 5+ years they deserve ""seniority"" and only close once a week LMAO!. I'm just like okay and you are still nothing but a sales associate and I've sold more than you ever will. I was a top employee"
bad,Worked floor cashier took care of dressing room attendant duties. Organized and stocked during slow hours.
bad,I enjoyed the customer service and learned a lot about appliances. I was able to shadow the management which gave me good insight. The most enjoyable part was helping people with their problems.
bad,"They only pay minimum wage, which was 7.25 at the time. The hours were horrible and no benefits."
bad,"Management is extremely inappropriate pretty much at all times. Touching employees and calling them names. They pretty much do nothing until a visit by a higher manager is coming up. Environment is overly stressful as the company has lost focus on core sales and now focuses on mobile checkout process and a rewards program. For instance, if you sell an item on the register instead of the iPad (mobile checkout) you are screamed at and threatened with your job. If you sell an item without getting someone to join the rewards program the previous also pretty much happens."
bad,This job was terrible. Management could care less about you if you aren't making their impossible quotas. Daily threats of termination for not making said impossible quotas. Weekly calls about how the team needs to step up and produce. Never getting told you have trainings to do until AFTER you get an email being threatened with a write up for not doing them.
bad,"Accepting a job with this KMart was the worst decision I made as far as accepting employment. It was total chaos. The management did not know their way around a rubber band. They promoted egotistical jerks who played favoritism all the time. The equipment was decades old and they couldn't be bothered to update them. They throw customer service and member loyalty at you like it was gold, but simply do not invest in their  customers at all. There were only a couple of good eggs on their staff and they were grossly taken advantage of. I would NEVER recommend working here unless you enjoy being completely frustrated for minimum wage."
bad,"There is no room for growth, even if you work as hard as possible. Even if you go above and beyond. you will always make $7.25 an hour. You are never treated fairly, even if you're doing other people's work just so customers don't have to wait. You are never doing enough. You are never good enough. The store runs on a high school-like environment."
bad,"If tthere was a possibility to put 0 stars, I would do it. This company does not care for their employees at all. This company even went so far as to making be depressed just by working there. I worked here for a year and got blamed for my supervisor. My store manager would tell me one thing, and my supervisor would tell me another different thing, and then my manager would tell me to do the polar opposite of my store manager. My car was broken in to while I was on the job and was forced to continue to work through my shift. All my belongings remained on the floor for 6 hours until 9pm where i was able to leave work and pick up my belongings. I hate this company, and I would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"I worked as a cashier for 5 months and I can personally say it was a nightmare. Your availability means nothing, they schedule you when they want, period. Not to mention, sometimes your schedule will change randomly and no one will even notify you. If you're gonna be a cashier, beware of credit. You HAVE to ask every customer and pester them repeatedly. If you don't get a certain amount of credit, your hours will lessen or you will be let go. Loss prevention SUCKS! People could be stealing left and right and all LP would care about is what the employees are up to and rat us out for conversing during slow periods. No one answers your pages on the intercom no matter how many times you announce it. The computers are as old as time and have to be shut down multiple times for overheating or crashing randomly and of course the cashiers catch the customers heat for something that is not our fault. I don't know if it was just this location or the company as a whole but I definately DON'T recommend this location."
bad,"You get laid off more then you work. Very little training and hardly any working equipment to work with, getting a job done without the proper tools is very difficult. 8 hour shifts with maybe a 20 minute lunch was very hard. Just not a good company to work for as an hourly associate or a salaried associate."
bad,"poor job culture, sad excuse for training, poor management, and unprofessional behavior"
bad,The work itself is decent but that's it. It was sooooo number based and management was horrible. I was in top 20% in the whole company in every single metric except loyalty and base 2 bonus which aren't considered in peak performer and they still bugged me about my numbers and were very inflexible with scheduling and are always looking to fire employees to improve their loss prevention performance numbers. Every year they fired about 4 or so employees right after the summer. It's a horrible place to work at. No pay increases. Horrible decision making all throughout the company. No job security. Play favorites to some employees. Very little opportunity for growth and even then the leads get weak pay. Around 9.25 an hour. Store manager gets paid decent though. Prob at least $60k.
bad,"Long story short: If you cannot sell 5 credit cards a day, don't take this job. I'm from Pasadena."
bad,This particular job site was filled with a lot of childish behavior not really focusing on the work task that was at hand daily. There was a blatant disregard for the customers and how their issues were to be handled.
bad,"This store is the worst place I've ever worked in my life!"
bad,"The good: Company will most likely hire you on the spot even with no experience. "
bad,"Sears isn't a good place to work.  They want employees to push credit apps, rewards, and care plans on customers.   If a customer doesn't want just one of those things, then the employee isn't praised for what he/she did get, but the employee gets in trouble for not getting what the customer did not want.  Forcing a customer to take what he/she doesn't want is NOT good customer service."
bad,"low technology, slow first aid, working by yourself. when you get your review, its 2 weeks late .expected to pressure customers so we'd get 1 credit card sign up for every 20 customers or else expect to be let go before Christmas, exactly 3 weeks before Christmas."
bad,"60 day review was late, given 2 weeks just before 90 day review. same thing with 30 day review, was also late. "
bad,Lack of professionalism. no control on the staff. Bad work schedule. I have worst experience working here. If you have other choice then I would suggest you to take that because anything would be better than this.
bad,Management wasn't good at all. I did actually enjoy working there though. It was a unique experience. the problem with sears they will bring you in as a cashier and look to get rid or you or move your profession with in a month.
bad,"Sears is making choices to run their own business into the ground. Allow their President do destroy the Company before you proceed with any employment there. There is no training. Any management worth anything finds better work elsewhere. Constantly over-worked and terribly under-paid."
bad,"worked with customers in providing legendary service with issues revolving around there service contracts."
bad,"Being a formal lp agent there at the sears in canoga park , ca, few agents there pushed other agents to get apprehensions, but they had 20 each, how, simple they would break every sears loss prevention protocol there is in the book, even going across the mall and detained someone that had already passed the feet after the entrance. Had one agent even stole a sears merchandise pepper spray, to use on a apprehension suspect, way out of line, same individual walked away from the scene and left othe agents there to deal with that situation. Also managers are well inform and know of the credit card fraud that goes on at that store aswell . Store manager and managers under that well know whats goes on, because also customers have come to the store and complaint about how they have credit cards being open with there info if they decline to open.. So yeah that store poorly managed and store poorly maintained .Dont u ever use the woman restrooms on the 3rd floor."
bad,"just called by recruiter offering a sales position, parts counter, 7.93 hr at 25 hours a week"
bad,"Long and stress full. learned to use the scanner gun, tag clothing, pick orders etc... "
bad,"I haven't worked there in a really long time.  However, I doubt Sears will survive much longer."
bad,"The job is simple, but has terrible management, pay is not great, no benefits."
bad,"Sears overall is just a bad company. Minimum wage pay, bad management, and this is the kicker....THE AMOUNT OF HOURS YOU GET IS BASED ON HOW MANY CUSTOMERS YOU PERSUADE TO APPLY FOR CREDIT CARDS !!!!!"
bad,no opportunity for growth was very unsatisfied with this job
bad,"i love everthing about the job,but the company wasn't honest and fair"
bad,"The training that is should be done, is not done. They care more about sells than they do about you actually fixing anything. They push you and talk down to you when you do something wrong. They have the worst turnover rate than I have seen from a company in a long time. I was still learning processes after 1 year of employment. Things that I should have known way before."
bad,"Sears is slowly dying, and will be out of business one day. Day in and day out, I struggle for my poverty-level wages just to compete against my own employer for sales. It makes one wonder why Sears doesn't just close all stores and get it over with."
bad,"Sears has so many metrics that need to be made everyday that it is impossible to keep track. When I worked there their metrics were called the ""big 8."" Now, I hear they have the ""big 11"". This company is confused about its priorities. They don't care about their employees."
bad,Never go back. Management doesn't care about their employees.
bad,"bad company to work for ,, no hours and management sucks.. honestly dont see this company around if changes arent made"
bad,I disliked this company because it was holiday help and they let you go and never call you back
bad,Ok for someone starting out and looking to get some quick experience at a large company.  Would not plan on anything long term.
bad,"This was my first job. I worked here for over a year and never received a raise. I was never praised for doing anything good which ultimately brought morale down because management was constantly ...... and basically hated their jobs, in my opinion. The stress with this job is definitely not worth being treated like complete .... and the bad pay. I was written up twice for having a low percentage, which is obtained by getting as many rewards members to give their phone number each shift. I was a wonderful employee. I was cross trained in different departments, treated everyone with respect, always showed up, was extremely friendly to customers and went out of my way to help them- it was not appreciated whatsoever. Ultimately I quit after being left as the only worker to man the phone, attend to layaway & jewelry customers & with freight- for 8 hours. They didn't even try calling someone in. Then when I needed to take my last break I asked my manager to cover me and she was a complete .... about it and made me feel like .... for taking it. I deserve respect and will not tolerate being treated in such a way. Stay away from kmart."
bad,"Sears....well its clear this company is going down the tubes fast. As a former employee who saw the righting on the wall, I got out as soon as I could. From the start my time with Sears was plagued with mismanagement from above. I had an awesome crew and they did the best they could but in the end it did not stop Sears from deciding to close my Auto Center. This is what happens when a company forgets what made them successful and abandons any and all advertising period. Like I said....read the news reports and do your homework...do not waste your time here."
bad,"not worth reviewing, very bad experience, honestly the worst working environment that I've ever experienced."
bad,Horrible. I worked more then I was at home and they could care less about their employees. They have no idea how to run a dc and everything is so unorganized. All you are to them is a number and that's all you'll ever be.
bad,i would prefer this job to someone just starting college looking for pocket money
bad,It was great experience for a job while I was in college but it is not a career
bad,not the best company I worked for. they are too busy being lazy than to really step up and help customers.
bad,"The Management at Kmart  North Las Vegas store was horrible. "
bad,Not a good company right now. Layoffs and bankruptcy are eminant.
bad,"Coworkers were great. "
bad,"I worked for this company for a long time. no advancements, I haven't had a raise in 9 years. They force you to shove credit cards. If you don't your fired. They say they are customer oriented. That's bull. Work for this company you work for chase Morgan ( owner of their sears card.) don't waist your time."
bad,No one works at Sears because they want to... they work there because they need a paycheck. Just saying.
bad,useless place where employee don't have a future that's why so many sears stores are closing
bad,Horrible workplace. Horrible bosses. Quality co-workers most of the time.
bad,"I am currently working in this position. I have given my two week notice effective Oct.4,2014. I have not received a nickel in raises since my hire date of July 2012.. Benefits are astronomical, management is a joke, expections are unrealistic, and scheduling is ridiculous. If you like being underappreciated and overworked for $11/hr with no holidays off and few weekends, then this job is perfect. You work 48 hrs a week and mandatory holidays and weekends."
bad,Computer training was provided.  Management and coworkers were very professional and friendly.
bad,"I wouldn't want to work for this company again.It was a very stressful environment and they don't care about their employees ,they feel that their employees are disposable."
bad,The managers are awful you don't ever get a raise no matter how hard you work. You get awful hours. It's just bad.
bad,While working at Sears as a receiving associate I as well as every other associate in the store regardless of the department was micro managed to the point of insanity. The store manager would call me by other employees names and at times would have me stop working on what I was doing just to move over 3 isles in the warehouse and then continue what I was doing where he was at even though I was already working towards him.
bad,"I worked there for 2 weeks and it was awful. They literally train you for 30 minutes on a register and throw you out on the floor by yourself during rush hour. Then they tell you that you're going to work a certain shift and schedule you a few days at 6am the first week. a few days at 5am the next week, and then 4am the week after....On top of that, they change your schedule a day before and don't even tell you. It definitely isn't worth working 3 hour shifts 7 days a week to get 21 hours a week."
bad,Managers were rude. If needed to ask a question about cash register they would get upset and say you should know this. Nothing was confidential co-workers new your personal information.
bad,No longer the iconic brand it once was. It was great the first years but then it became more of a Corporate puppet and no more investing into the actual stores and it's most valuable assets which were it's great loyal employees.
bad,"no room for advancement, company keeps eliminating postiitons, company will not be open much longer."
bad,"This company don't pay you enuff, "
bad,all sears cares about is there money and if your in management your their slave. they have no consideration for employees and you never get a raise macdonalds is prob better
bad,Long days due to explaining insurance information to customers.
bad,"No organization skills. "
bad,There is no communication between departments. Everyone is unhappy. No raises in three years.
bad,This job started off good with the hours and then they kept dropping and dropping you could only have full time if have a open schedule I don't think that was fair at all and then the amount of work you do is a lot for only $9.00 and the amount of experience I had I couldn't move into any position this job really sucks and I gotta find something else as soon as possible.
bad,"I was an employee here for over a year. I worked amongst my fellow employees who have been there for 5+ years and still got paid 7.25/hr. They make it a necessity that you have to get credit card apps, even if it means borderline pure pressuring the customers. Which was something I was not comfortable with since I knew the interest on the card was over 25%. No. The hours are so long. Which would make sense because you would have to work long hours is you would want to make anything worth a little bit since your only getting paid 7.25. Then there's this stupid ""Shop Your Way"" program as well that you HAVE to get every customer to sign up. Annoying. Then you have micromanagers who come around twice a day-everyday to make sure they tell you how your merits are and how close you are to loosing your job if you don't increase them. And keep in mind, this is Sears we are talking about, you would be lucky to catch six customers in there at one time. It's in a downward spiral. In the time I was there they eliminated the HR personnel. So they had one person in charge of 3 different districts. It was nuts! Just not a good company."
bad,"Over worked, stressed, management was unethical, and unprofessional."
bad,"A hideous corporation to work for. Woeful wages, dreadful employee treatment. No wonder it's easy to get hired. They will milk you for every thing and the reward is infinitesimal."
bad,Management it terrible.  Employees some are nice but others are very rude but they get that from management who are the same way. They always say customers first but not in sebring never seen anything like it before.  I've never once came into the store until I started working there it terrible. now I know why there going under fast ... my advice work some place else.unless you like being rude and dont care about customers than this is the place for you
bad,"This job is great if you're looking for your first job right out of high school. This is a good ""extra cash"" kind of a job but, nowhere near being able to support a family type of job. This company doesn't like to pay more than minimum wage. Yet, they want you to bust your behind every day and want to fire people when already short handed and inconvenience other employees on their days off. Begging them to come in because they stuck their own foot in their mouth. Management is completely unappreciative, They never want to help you out but want to be waited on hand and foot if you're ready to sit there and let a company walk all over you and pay you next to nothing APPLY APPLY APPLY!"
bad,"Sears has a reputation of mistreating their employees. Their expectations are, at times, a bit unrealistic. The turnover for employees at my Sears locations was the highest I've ever seen."
bad,not a very good work place. rude co-works and bad management
bad,I moved around to three different stores trying to move up in the company. As well as trying to get closer to home. Sears upper management do not care at all about personal life at home. The Phoenix DM is a single lady who devotes her entire life to Sears and she expects everyone else to do the same. I would constantly get yelled at for leave early after a 12 or 14 hour day. Upper management expect full open to close shifts.
bad,"If you're looking for a start to retail and have very little respect for yourself then this is the place to start. The Kings Plaza location is not only unprofessional but the management is messy and truly embarrassing. The people who manage this place do nothing all day but bark orders disrespectfully. Not only do they clearly have no respect for their employees but obviously lack self respect. There are better things out there, avoid this place like the plague."
bad,I currently work for the shoreline location it's a joke. The pay is terrible the management is horrible there's so much left to be desired it's not even funny.
bad,Management was horrible but other than that the job was enjoyable.
bad,"Company sucks. The managers don't do their job, they leave it to the associates."
bad,"bad management"
bad,"Being in the fashion world, the job was very different. I learned about buying Upholstery - fabric, leather,bonded leather and PVC or lather look alike Required to Assemble Furniture, rugs, fireplaces."
bad,"1.The absolute wort place to work !!! The only place i have worked where no one knows how the commission structure adds up."
bad,This place is a joke.  There is no advancement and no raises.  Corporate corruption is standard issue.  Someone stole over $700 dollars in commission from me 4 years ago and I have yet to be reimbursed.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.
bad,This store is no longer in existence. Was a good job during the summer.
bad,"A typical day is doing my work and helping people that also need help doing their job. I learned how to be patient and understanding. My co worker are like family to me, we look out for each other. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people."
bad,they are going out of buisness but wont tell anyone they dont give raises talk to you like a dog work you real hard and pay you nothing they steal so the store never makes money awful
bad,"I was called in for an interview to cashier. Upon arriving the clothing sections were a mess and no one was available to interview me."
bad,"It was fun to work here, but very boring. There was never anything to do, and when there was something to do it would only take about 5 minutes to do it."
bad,"The location i worked at was in shambles.  I do not mean the building i mean the upper managment, was just horrible.  They ignored your requests for time off. Even if it was o.k.'ed.  One manager would tell you to do a task, then while doing that task a different manager would come along and tell you to do someting totally different, and then when you finaly started to do waht the second manger sked a third manager would tell you that what you were doing was a waste of time and tell you to just go out on the sales floor and clean up.  this didnt happen just a couple times this was a recurring thing that happened 3 to four times a week and i was part itme only there 3 or 4 days a week. They would have you close go home at 11 pm and expect you to come in at 6 am to open the next day."
bad,"As an associate paid by commission in a generally quiet business, my main task each day was to meet certain sales goals which, with the schedules that were assigned to me, was nearly impossible. My hours were typically opening, which meant I would often start one hour before the store opened. As a part-time associate, I was only able to work up to 4 hours on most days, so 1/4 of my day was already finished by the time the store has even opened. I took inventory of what we had in stock every day. The computers were so out-dated and the warehouse staff never updated what was sold or received, so it was crucial to us that we get a physical list ourselves. This usually also took about 30 minutes to an hour to do, no big deal if it could be done in the early morning, but one associate had to be on the floor at all times even before the doors opened (for ""security"" reasons), and there was usually only one associate in each department in the mornings. Plus, every day started with a little pep rally that always went on much longer than planned, and I believe was a much greater security issue than taking inventory, as it was mandatory for all associates (including LP) within the building to attend. Anyway, back to the quotas. With every sale you make, you were required to sell ""Protection Agreements,"" Sears' in-house warranty which cost nearly as much as the products themselves. Your only chance at selling them was to hope you meet Richie Rich himself (who knows why he's shopping at Sears?), or get some confused elderly person who thought you were their grandchild to believe that Sears"
bad,Management team sucked. They were so unorganized and unprofessional.
bad,"I worked at this place for 5 weeks, Why did I leave in such a short period of time you ask? Well, because our trainer cared more about showing us videos on YouTube, talking about her personal life, her kids and her boyfriend. On top of that her son was always coming in to the class and interrupting the class and asking for money. Their were a few co-workers who were so immature it distracted me. Also, I had a co-worker threaten me and nothing was done and it was a hostile work environment. One of my co-workers convinced the trainer to show a picture of a character from Toy Story 2 and said how I looked like that character which was harassment. It is simply WAY too much information to absorb in just 3 weeks and then throwing us to the wolves like they do. If they would give more than 3 weeks and paid us more the company would not have such a high turnover rater. Also, you are not allowed to hangup on a customer no matter how angry they get which is so stupid. Every other call center I worked at was NEVER like that. Also, you have to limit how much you go to the bathroom and if you go to much you can get terminated. This place sucks!"
bad,It Was too much business mixed with personal with this job. It felt like a high school. I wold never wanna go through that
bad,Typically the day starts with any outlier performances that you had the previous day and a hour conference call to recap that performance before the store opens.  I learned that people are the most important assest. The hardest part of the job is accomplish sales when the overall company is down and consumer has lost confidence in the products.  The most enjoyable was the people I worked with.
bad,"Sears often times singles out Black and Hispanic employees and shoppers for surveillance often times without due cause. The surveillance room was a hang out place for White managers and assistant managers as well a regular employees who often time sat around watching Black and Hispanic employees and shoppers while they laughed at the poor ""minorities"" who busted their humps for minimum wage as well as using the cameras to zoom in on female employees and female shoppers body parts. Sears is a joke and when they finally go out of business the world will left a much better place."
bad,"Terrible! No communication between the management or other associates. The company has to drive to invest any money back into the company to give the associates proper supplies to make their tasks manageable. I worked here because I was desperate for a job, but I urge people to look a little harder."
bad,"Sears is a commission based job, we need better pay with benefits.  Many accomplishments have been made, but there is room for better opportunities in the workplace."
bad,"Poor management and lack of desire to improve. unsafe working conditions, and lack of folling up on processes."
bad,Unload trucks help with customer. I have learn a lot by work for sears I think the management can be a lot better than what it is I like my co-workers do more work than others my most enjoyable of the job is when I get off
bad,"They start employees at 8/hr. and you can never get a raise. What they ask  from employees that they pay minimum to is outrageous, you have to get credit cards, ask for emails to sigh up to their club, have a quota of internet sales shipped to home, have to make at least 5 people a month fill out a customer survey and they have to give you 10s and the store 10s. and if you dont get all this things done, mind you at minimum wage they will cut your hrs. I know employees that have worked there for years and still earn minimum wage. I worked in the sales dept and when a product was delivered and was dented they would take your commission even if its not your fault. Prices are always cheaper online compared to the store, so if a customer comes in wanting the online price or finds out about the price differences and ask for a price match from our own website (sears.com) we have to try not to give them that price or our commission is cut. Even once they see it online cheaper and they come back for an adjustment they take your commission. As a company they dont focus on customer service, they focus on how much they can get out of their customers and employees. They are going down and they are trying to get as  much as they can. That is the mentality of  owner Eddie Lampert, you can tell from his past endeavors. Beware.  They dont even have an HR dept anymore, that says alot of how much the care."
bad,Customer's call to complain and you strive to provide customer service.  Call volume fluctuates.
bad,"-No benefits whatsoever"
bad,"Treats their associates with no respect. Provides the minimum for benefits. Barely ensures that their associates are treated, compensated, and/or valued to what state laws require. Remember there are always loop holes."
bad,"A new manager was put in place due to the store closing and she proceeded to fire all employees to put new hires in place. I would not advise working for this store specifically, you are constantly at risk of losing your job."
bad,When I worked for Sears it was great for the first year than that all changed with the change of management. I liked the people I working with I how ever didn't like how I had to ask customers If they wanted a credit application to apply for a credit card.
bad,I learned at this job customer service means everything. i achieved 100% ratings at this store.
bad,"Its all about numbers in this business. Especially  in Loss Prevention. all they care about is apprehensions in EL Paso, Texas. Always hiring and there is always a reset of workers. This Place only cares about is themselves in management!! Low pay ! Look elsewhere!"
bad,"I worked at Kmart as a cashier, and let me tell you all, it the most awful experience ever. The management team where always degrading us in front of customers, each n every one of them never had the same view of any policies there leaving us confused on what was right or wrong. The manager kept changing the policy , without notice it seem like if he didn't wanna deal with something it was automatically not allowed in store anymore. Example: on monitor if we hit print we would be written up, even if the customer didn't wanna n e receipt. Are you kidding me? No I am not that's the truth. Gotta love it when the big wigs come all upper management act as though they are so delightful and helpful to us cashiers if only they knew- this was the most unorganized job I've ever worked for not to mention how dirty the store was, customes always complained about the fifty feet of paper they got even for buying one thing n the fifty questions they don't like it  get a clue sears holding, customers wanna be in n out ta stores not in line for ten mins. This company is not about customer service , I've seen people get fired for helping customers a little to much never heard of such a thing till Kmart. No wonder half there stores have closed. I am sure this will be next."
bad,"Typical day would be processing of the in-coming freight, setting of the shoe sales floor in a timely manner and keeping the shoe stockroom in shoe order. Learned to interact with different personalities on a daily basis. My co-workers kept a smile on my face with their humor. Nothing about this position was hard. Most enjoyable was helping cusomers."
bad,Management could not get it together. One person would tell me something and then someone would tell me I'm wrong. Very unorganized.
bad,"As an Office Assistant with Sears Canada and as an In Store Consultant  with Sears Home Services(custom home installations), my typical day in both roles was service service service with a smile and efficiency. "
bad,"My typical day at work, displaying new merchandise for customers."
bad,"Did not like my experience of working for Sears. I was given minimal hours and when I started a new job I intended to keep Sears but they refused to work around my other schedule which was providing me with full-time work, so I quit."
bad,"Sears cares not about how impossible the sales goals are, nor do they bother with any customer feedback on the decline of their products. It is a soulless grind, where either your goals on the meager customer flow or are shown the door. Apply only if you want to work for a company that sells it's top stores in a slow process of liquidation."
bad,Being at Sears is a horrible place to work. The culture seems as though everyone is so miserable at work that they all hate each other instead. Management consists of management style-x and has a militaristic feel to it. Lunches are only a half hour and the pay is less than acceptable for the amount of work they expect.
bad,"Sears is not a good place to work..."
bad,"Leads and management don't know their butts from the hole in the ground. Mgrs make you feel dumber after talking to them"
bad,"integratiy mademe leave this position, mine is higher then theirs. Manager only cares how her numbers look. Training is a joke."
bad,"My experience managing invoices, collaborating with vendors to resolve differences, performing audits, completing reconciliation reports and supporting remote locations allows you to add an experience professional to your team – one who will be productive at once. Created customer invoices. Worked with customers and Corporate on collection to maintain a current AR aging schedule. Banking: deposited checks, prepared bank statement."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of your managers telling you that, if you don't get customers to sign up for a credit card, then you will be fired. Lunches were especially horrible due to the fact that you had 30 minutes to eat. That's minutes to go buy your food, 10 minutes to come back, and 10 minutes to eat. I learned that Sears has 1980's technology, employees get yelled at if they sit down, and management likes to sit on their but all day until forced to come out of the office. If somebody calls for help, they sit there saying ""who wants to get it"" for 15 minutes until, finally, somebody reluctantly gets up to ""help"". My co-workers were people to were high on the job yet, ironically, were the favorites, even though they constantly arrived late, left early, ignored their job, and communicated with a negative attitude. The hardest part of the job was when the managers told you to complete online assessments when there were no customers around. This would have been fine, except there were always customers, and each assessment took 30-45 minutes to complete. Also, the typical temperature in Sears is 79-83 degrees because they ""don't want to waste money on air conditioning."" The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving after the store closed.... even though we were there for an extra hour and a half every night thanks to the lovely employees who didn't do their job. A word of advise? NEVER work at Sears."
bad,They do not train you and are extremely rude for no reason.  No one welcomes you to the company.  Avoid this company if you can... other retail organizations are much more worth your time.
bad,good starting out job for a high schooler or college student but definielty not enough pay if you have a family
bad,"While most of the staff were very friendly, the majority of managers were rude and inconsiderate."
bad,"Sears and Kmart provide a very poor work environment. Right off the bat they let you know, forget about advancement."
bad,sears is for those who are retired looking for something to keep them busy.
bad,"No one was paid what they needed to be paid. Very negative atmosphere. Micromanaging was a part of daily routine. Lack of focus on employees, no engagement from upper management."
bad,Managers are unprofessional and the leads are lazyy. Customers are usually pleasant. But some can be a little destructive.
bad,You did way to much for what you actually get paid. They don't care about your schooling or nothing. Managers are always complaining about numbers and scoreboards but never recognize you when you've done good. Sears is such a horrible company and job to work for. When working long hours they never wanted to give you 2 lunches although you've worked 12 hours or no breaks. It's only 1 30min lunch
bad,"I enjoyed my customers and the job itself. But the company and management team that they company had at the time were very unprofessional and only concerned about making the compnay money, not concerned at all about the customers or the staffs well being or satifaction."
bad,"I worked for sears for about 3 years in Castleton and that was the worst job ever! I worked hard, you never get noticed for doing anything good or for helping out. their management team is HORRIBLE their rude, lazy, and very unprofessional. They will only give 6 to 5 hours a day paying minimum wage . don't even waste your time filling out the application."
bad,the job was not hard its was the manager that didn't like certain people including me and other workers he let go.
bad,A typical day at this establishment is spent with me stuck for 4-6 hours at a cash register smiling banally at customers while listening to their list of complaints about the store ranging from unhelpful staff to price gouging.
bad,I worked for sears for a little under a month and had to quit because of the horrible work environment that upper management creates.  If you are a hard working and dedicated personality then do not waste your time here. If you decide to work here  Do not question upper management on shady practices or they will discipline you.
bad,managment does not follow policies when it come to thier employees and their absentism
bad,In todays world it seems information is more inportant than human needs. This includes employees and customers. There is no one on one with customers anymore.
bad,"You will be required to badger customers into signing up for Sears card resulting in customers getting angry. Receipts seem like they are three feet long with coupons most people will never use, annoying the customers. Some of the co-workers are decent people, others are terrible. Same goes for management. Don't work for Sears unless there is nothing else available."
bad,"moved out of the area so i couldn't commute as reliable as before"
bad,Working at Sears was boring because we were never busy. You also had to get a certain amount of credit applications from each customer so you didn't get your hours cut or lose your job. Management was horrible.
bad,"a decent company that cares more about there pocket book then the employees that make money for the company, no advancement or raise in 4 yrs. loosing employees doesn't matter to the management,...routes that cover lots of miles and wasted time. overlapping other service technicans"
bad,"The job started out okay. My co workers were very friendly & helpful. But the management is beyond horrible. The store manager is an a hole, not associate friendly at all just about making money & meeting a quota. The managers & supervisors are just as bad as the store manager. They don't know how to communicate, basically talk to you like a child & they're a bunch of snakes. They're not helpful at all either, fellow associates were more helpful then them. They just give you a task & don't explain it at all and expect you to get it. If you're looking for a job don't go to Marley Station Sears, they don't give a flying flick about their employees. But too be honest judging from most of the reviews on here that's all sears. The glory days of Sears are gone now, they're losing customers, & everyone are going to places like Macy's for better quality in clothes & places like Best Buy or HH Gregg for their appliances. I just think that corporate realizes it & puts pressure on these managers to change that when in reality there's nothing they can do. Their hey day is over, Sears should just file for bankruptcy & close it's doors like Montgomery Wards did."
bad,"everything sucked. management was horrible, pay was awful, tasks were tedious."
bad,"There is not enough room in this box to tell you how much this job sucks.  I am a Manager at Sears and am lucky enough to see how other managers treat the associates!  The really great thing is that when you stand up and tell them that their behavior is not right, they get offended and YOU get ostrasized!  Overall the culture in sears is bad.  The pay is not good and the expectations are lofty (for hourly associates).  The compensation for managers is average if not a little above average for a mid level manager.  If you are a Store Manager, your life is pretty good all around.  Sears clearly takes care of the leadership first, customers second and its hourly ""worker bees"" last."
bad,"The store has little to no customers on a regular basis yet still maintain an unreasonable sales standard. The management was out of line, abusive and rude."
bad,"Worst management ever, a boys club that discriminates on age, gender.  GM and DM cover up all thats wrong or against company policy, again a boys club, the worst customer service and the worst leaders from GM and UP .  Biggest mistake and company to work for."
bad,The people made it horrible was nothing but drama and bs. Made a check but not without being how to do my job 50 billion times a day when I was the only one doing my job. Very racist
bad,They do not care about there employees. They work you and treat you like a dog. Management and HR are horrible. The Kmart store in Golden Gate FL is the store I am speaking of.
bad,"Grate place to have experience working with different customers. fun to work with kids as a kid photographer."
bad,"Sears is the most immoral, unethical place I have ever worked. I took this job as a favor to my best friend who owned the local hometown store. I did not like Sears policies from the very beginning. Sadly, my friend passed away in August and Sears was very cold and uncaring during that period. She had devoted 18 years of her life to that store and they didn't even want to close the store for her funeral. I am the administrator of her estate and have received no cooperation whatsoever from Sears. They refused to let me retrieve her personal property from the store. The estate was cheated out of thousands and thousands of dollars of commissions. I can understand why Sears stores are closing all across the country. They do not care about their customers, employees or hometown store owners. They are a greedy, self-serving entity. Needless to say, I will never darken the doors of another Sears store. Nor will any of my friends or family."
bad,"Employees are not treated with any respect.  Current corporate values are not to value either the customer or the values employees."
bad,"after working at the sears in Yonkers, new York I made a note to myself that I would never work in retail again! It was unorganized pertaining to everything from management,the culture of the business and the environment. All of the managers and supervisors fraternized outside of work so you could imagine how unprofessional it was, especially when needed to file a formal complaint. Not to mention the dating inside of the workplace which caused many scenes on the sales floor and disgruntled workers. It was unethical and one of the worse places to be employed including the 7.25 an hour pay with no annual raise."
bad,"I worked for Sears for 2 years. Management is horrible. They're all about credit card inquires, and the employees are overworked and well underpaid, but if you're looking for a job just for money, go for it. Just don't make plans to be there for a definite amount of time. Definitely not worth the headache. on the other hand, the plus side is the friendships I made with co-workers."
bad,"Cashiers are expected to ask every person they cash out to sign-up for a sears card, and credit card. If a specified number isn't met the employee will be fired."
bad,"Terrible management, no raises, rude customers."
bad,"Recieving in-bound calls"
bad,"The store that I worked at had absolutely HORRIBLE management. The manager of this store wanted to be number one in credit applications so they went to extremes to get us to have a customer try for a card. What I heard is that the company wanted cashiers to have at least 10 a month. However, these people LITERALLY and I do mean LITERALLY wanted people to have at the VERY LEAST  10+ a day. If you were not getting this amount per day they couldn't fire you but they discouraged you to quit by not giving you any hours. They would schedule you for MAYBE give you 10 hours or so a week. They were not legally allowed to do that but they did it anyway. "
bad,"Don't work here!"
bad,"Sears Holding Co. has just announced that they are going to close their flag-ship store in Chicago Illinois because of their continuing business losses.  In the last year, Sears has continued to close stores and reduce their sales staff.  I have noticed other in-store managerial problems that I am not interested in sharing."
bad,"Beaucoup de stress à gérer au quotidien pour un avenir, une carrière inexistante."
bad,"The management is all over the place, all the managers have different opinions on how things should be run, unprofessional environment, barely any advancement opportunities, this is just a job you should skip."
bad,"This company lacked real leadership and direction. Those in charge, only cared about themselves looking good. Although I met people with longevity, there was no room for advancement. The pay was terrible for the work and efficiency. The co workers were excellent and great at their jobs but the various departments within the store lack team work."
bad,I liked what I did for a living until I met the sears team. The system of checks and balances needs lots of work.
bad,"this company has gone down hill. they need to shut all doors on all sears stores, if this is what customers can expect. i have only worked there for 2 days and already i hate it and its extremely boring and i am looking for something else"
bad,Poor place to work ...They have the highest turn over rate I have ever seen...They will not last long don't waste your time
bad,"When I applied at Sears I did so online, inside a Sears location that had a ""Now Hiring"" sign, and applied using the store's kiosk. A month later I was emailed an interview date and time. I showed up promptly, ready to interview but was told that I ""wasn't expected"". The Asset Protection manager looked at my resumé, acknowledged my ten years of experience in the field and then told me ""I only hire ex military"" and told me to ""try someplace else"". A week later I was asked to come back by the store manager that told me ""The district Lp manager is making me hire you based on experience but please know I won't give you any hours"". After starting out with nothing I worked my way to the management level in a years time. As I traveled to different stores in the southeast I noticed that ALL Sears management teams were the same. Its a cutthroat, back-stabbing environment where Sales associates are penalized and threatened daily for not meeting quota's on everything from sales to pushing company credit cards on customers. Asset Protection/Loss Prevention agents and managers are also given quotas for external and internal theft cases. If you are coming up short with internals the company uses what they call ""integrity tests"" in which AP/LP staff are told to plant loaded gift cards in the associates break-rooms and then told to fire the associate that try's to use them or even just check the balance. Its an unstable, unfair company that has more upper and lower management changes going all the way up to executives than I've ever witnessed in my life."
bad,handles customer complaints regarding service with sears
bad,"it is a normal retail environment, nothing more, nothing less.  The loss prevention department is used to inflict fear in employees however."
bad,"I was very unhappy with the sears that I was placed in because I did not feel that they had an equal opportunity workplace. I was uncomfortable first because white people used the N word all the time. And I am mixed so once it was obvious they began to treat me different. I was always doing the work of others but not getting paid for the extra work. And when I complained to managers they told me that it did not matter that the other workers did not do their job only that I did. And when I was let go it was do to racial profiling, I was accused of saying something racist, but it was the other way around and none of the managers took time to hear me out. I was just let go and told by HR that there was nothing that could be done. I am not a fan of sears and would not suggest anyone work there."
bad,They did not pay me for all hours worked. The store manager just shrugged it off like it wasnt a big deal.Also the manager training me ran off with his girlfriend most of the time leaving me not knowing what to do since I was so new! What a Joke!
bad,"Management is horrible and so are the hours and pay! Loved my coworkers and customers, but upper management made working unenjoyable"
bad,I just would not recommend to anyone. This store would need to undergo a complete restructure in all management areas.
bad,My Typical day at work was to fold clothes and service the customers.
bad,This place is horrible. Absolutely horrible. It drives away all of the decent employees in order to hire low level people who have no idea what they are doing.
bad,I work part time at sears and it is not a good company to work for. you do medial task for low pay. There is always too much to do and very little time to do it. When the busy season is over you're lucky to get 8 hours a week. They also schedule you for three hour days at 7.25 its not worth traveling to. The store has too many managers so you don't know who to listen to or whom to report to. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with customers and finding what they need. however with what I do it is a rarity. If i could get more hours I would be a little more happier with working there since that is the major problem. I like my coworkers and I like most of the management personnel.
bad,I was hired for inbound parts calls. What a joke !!!!!!! My sales experience is in the wholesale market.Being listened to and directed like a robot made me realize that the people who work at Sears are desperate and or can not talk to anybody in person. I chose to leave to look for a better job. Thank you Sears for the parts training and info I can use at another place !!!!!
bad,"Typical day is figuring out which section you are working in.Then finding out your the only one on the floor. On the sales floor you stock and clean while following the task sheet. However the task sheet is unrealistic and manager adds on to it through the day! Busting your butt off to clean and fix 2 pieces of clothes and stocking only to find out people on cash are looking for you. Then you go to cover breaks and the regular staff dont come back on time and then ask you to clean up their desk when its their duty too. Floor is left messy and excepted to stay till done. Task sheet is left undone due to being stuck on till."
bad,"Coworkers were good, job was fun, but the pay was way too low. Especially for the risk the lpa take"
bad,Benfits and compensation is horrible. Moving up within the company is ridiculous!!
bad,"this place was a joke to work for. The treat their employees like crud...Management is an entire joke, the GM has no clue on what he is doing. I quit because i was getting less than 15 hours a week, and i can NOT support my family on that"
bad,"Don't expect any pay raises"
bad,I was always working double shifts by myself in the clothing department. Pay was horrible
bad,"the job was a complete lie from start to finish, they scammed people to get them to work, was promised 700 a week actually earned for a 40 hr week less then 200 quit very quickly they had no work"
bad,I did not like working at this place at all. I worked so hard and it paid off because the manager would call me in to work extra hours over anyone else but the only thing was...he wouldn't do any work. My manger would literally call me in or ask me to work overtime so I could straighten up shoes and reset shelves while he walked around to other departments doing absolutely nothing. It made me feel good that he would consider calling me but I did not like that I worked so hard for the department to look good but was never given the credit.
bad,My first job ever and I hated it. Managment was totally unproffesional and unfriendly. They changed managers every month and they didnt aknowledge the hard working employees.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked!  They train you a day and expect you to know everything!  Then I work a full week and am paid for 3 hours??  I went to one of the assistant managers regarding this and she talked to me like I was an idiot!
bad,Dont waste your time/ not a stable company... You will come to work and work will be gone!
bad,"Working a seasonal job felt like a good idea, however I am not cut out to work retail. I had a difficult time talking people into signing up for a credit card w/ high interest rate. I explained and was hired around my school schedule, but they ""needed me when they needed me"" and I had no choice but to choose school. There were no breaks unless I could find someone to cover for me. (Because it was the jewelry dept. there were only a few people who had authorization to be in that dept)"
bad,"If Sears didn't have their appliances and the good reputation that comes with that, they'd be long gone. A typical day at work at the Kingston, NY Sears as a Jewelry Associate would be getting to work, and standing there. I am surprised the glass of the jewelry cases didn't fall apart I cleaned it so often. My idiotic manager was CONVINCED that announcements for the old fashioned, overly-priced, poor-quality jewelry over the store's loud speaker would drive our sales... It didn't. I would basically have to beg people to even come LOOK at the merchandise in the cases. And when I did finally make a sale (usually something small and to somebody about seventy years old or older), I would have to push the absolutely STUPID Care Plans. The Care Plans that you get scored on selling are the biggest scam that Sears has going. The jewelry came back, more times than not, unfixed. Then there was a time a gold chain came back and it wasn't gold anymore! People paid for these ""extended warranties"" and never knew how much they were getting ripped off. So on a good day, I'd get maybe three customers. And occasionally after pushing the Care Plan, the Rewards program, the store credit card AND the credit card that could be used elsewhere the customer would become frustrated and walk away. The coworkers I had in the jewelry section were a joke. They lied about having a GED, and really were high school dropouts who stole company time constantly."
bad,"long hours , not enough pay. I would work 40+ hours and my check wouldn't be enough to support my child and i"
bad,there was not much hours to give and you could not make a decent living
bad,I loved coming to work opening up doing my duties for the day working with customer the hardest part of my job was closing after a big sale in the store we had so much thing to do
bad,I was hired and trained and then never put on the schedule. I was also told that the only way to check my schedule was to come into the store. I did this for a week without being scheduled and then stopped. 3 weeks later I get a call saying I didn't show up for work and they asked if I could come in.
bad,The Florence SC store is a terrible place to work.  You have people in management that is racist.
bad,Loading and unloading customer merchandise into vechicles. This company closed down the local sears store without giving any employees warning.
bad,business is very slow to non not a lot of new stuff coming in to sale. the high management only worries about pa
bad,Horrible place to work because of the way management treats you
bad,"Sears was a huge headache for me. It did have good moments however, that was very limited. A typical day at sears wasn't too bad as a PM tech however my biggest problem was payroll and management. I was repeatedly cheated out of some of my money when received a paycheck and the matter was never resolved. I felt that there was a lack of urgency. The management was terrible. I had only been working there for 1 month and they already forced and expected me to understand all of the equipment and effectively troubleshoot with any proper training. The hardest part of the job was being thrown out in the service field without proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I received all brand new tools and parts."
bad,The section that I worked in was a very fun and close team. I learned a lot about the value of Lands' End Clothing.
bad,Easy Job but very unprofessional. Everyone starts and quit within two weeks at this location.
bad,"A horrible place to work at the call center. Very unprofessional managers, and the training for the job is atrocious. If you enjoy being yelled at by customers and management this is the job for you. "
bad,This job rview is the same as Sears becauethere are both in the same building and the same comapny. But still score this company a --10.
bad,Very poorly run. The manager had no clue what she was doing and it showed more and more each day.
bad,"Not much to say, hours are bad, pay is bad, coworkers are bad, and Management is worse.  Don't bother trying to get promoted, they will promise it but never will happen when the times comes."
bad,"Store didn't have my login information for the cashier ready on day one, so I was bouncing between departments. Minimum wage is all you get, but you are put to work as if you are making $10/hr. I made more money taking bets on horses with Sportech, Inc."
bad,I assisted customers in selling appliance to all kinds of people on daily basis.
bad,Typical day at work was go do your job and get yelled at all day by management. Management would give you infraction for missing even when you had a doctors note.
bad,"This job was a good job....the pay was decent and it could be fun at times. The management was a bit chaotic, seemed there was no communication between anyone. I have a small child and I always had a hassle when it came to me having to take him to any appointments. It was a severe headache to receive any time off even if you asked for it months in advance."
bad,training was poor for their expectations of performance.  asked to work in poor conditions without proper tools.  management did not respond to requests for training support
bad,"There was absolutely no benefit to working for Sears. Management at all levels are only concerned with their personal agenda(s). This company goes through part time employees at a ridiculous rate. No benefits, terrible compensation and a horrible atmosphere. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the combination of backstabbing coworkers and irate customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out and going home."
bad,a lot drugs and alcohol abuse in workplace and you get ripped off every time you get pay
bad,"Sears management in a call center environment doesn't focus on good customer service but rather, they focus on the ""numbers"" alone to judge how well or poorly an employee is doing. Very sad commentary for Sears! As a retailer? They're missing the mark every time and they can't or won't figure it out."
bad,"poor management, unrealistic company goals. Customer service was met and maintained by the employees not the management/credit applications were a nuisance."
bad,"Typically employees are given goals at the start of each week to meet or exceed.  These goals include having every customer sign up or take ""advantage"" of programs that are of no real value to the individual. Credit card applications and store bonus cards are forced upon customers though they have politely asserted that they didn't want them three and four times.  In my experience, Sears cared little for the actual needs and support of their customer."
bad,"The company has retracted from providing customer service to an environment condusive to numbers oriented. No longer focused on Providing top quality customer service, they focus on numbers that do benefit the customer. Their level of support from support teams that are supposed to be there to provide top quality customer service has been replaced with an atmosphere of your making this matrix, your the reason that customers are leaving with no product. "
bad,This is the worst company to work for. I have never worked anywhere where I heard the store management talk so venomously about corporate higher ups.
bad,"SALE< SALE SALE or bye bye"
bad,"I started working part-time (no chance for fulltime job anymore as sears doesn't want to pay the extra expenses of benefits) at sears as a salesman during the holiday season on 2007 selling small appliances. The commissions were good back then and most stuff sold themselves. If items were regularly priced, you can modify the price up to 10% without needing a managers approval to make a sale. "
bad,The best part is the people I've met and befriended. I would never tell anyone to work for this company not even my worst enemy.
bad,Inbound calls from customer with questions about appliances.
bad,This is not sears it's kmart and the location is on its last breath!  The store maneger's are two faced not to mention the lost prevention manager only cares about hireing people that she thinks will steal so that she can get a  bonus when she catches them. This job isn't good they won't pay you what you deserve also one of the guys that works in lp is racist & sexest meaning he treats women horrible although he's a coward. This kmart location will not be open long and you will not recieve as many hours as they say you will. This is a company of bold face liars so I would not recomend this job for anyone
bad,"temporary job, unfortunately very poor management, but I learned about retail, how to manage a situation where the customer gets angry and how my responses can affect me but most to the company."
bad,"Every member of management sits in the office and plays with their phones and yells at others when their work isn't done. Sexual harassment isn't an issue here, because every member of management can get away with it."
bad,Horrible leadership no respect for employees at all. Management always breaks policy all the time. NO LEADERSHIP!!!
bad,"des gestionnaire pas du tout compétant"
bad,I just come to work to do my job. The company given me the opportunity to gain work experience.
bad,"All I was allowed to do was ring out customers. I was forced to get credit card applications and if I did not get the number of applications they desired, I was punished by it by getting suspended for a week. Management did not care and yelled at me if I didn't give them what they wanted. The hardest part of the job was living with working for tyrants. There was no enjoyment."
bad,Sears is a terrible company to work for. They promise to train you but never do. They put you on the floor without an inkling of how to operate the ancient DOS point of sale system which is an absolute nightmare. The management is some of the worst I have ever seen anywhere. They are of no help whatsoever and treat you like you're an idiot if you ask a question. The current store manager in the store where I worked was probably the worst and certainly the most unpleasant I've ever worked for. Glad to be gone. I can certainly understand why so many business analysts think Sears is doomed. It should be.
bad,The work that is expected of you is outrageous for the low minimum wage you are given. The management is always unsure of things and are not helpful. Customer satisfaction is at an all time low as well as profits it seems.
bad,hours get cut every week and management does not care about their employees. co workers are very good at their job but get no recognition. hardest part of the job is the heat inside the trucks.
bad,Management is awful. Do way to much for minimum wage. They wont work around school schedules. Try to demand you work outside of your job description without any extra pay
bad,Carpet cleaning services are great. The was only a Carpet cleaning Franchise and not actually Sears.
bad,All the people I worked with were great people but the company does not know how to treat their employees.
bad,"Managers were constantly threatening employees and said they would get fired if they did not sell a lot more of their worthless extended 3 or 5 year warranties."
bad,Do not work for sears Novi. The management is very poor. Compensation is minimal at best.
bad,"two thumbs down, they failed at every attemp to be human. "
bad,"The outlet stores had good prices at one time.  Lack of leadership and direction has caused an environment where employees are concerned about lack of inventory, and if the product has been serviced.  How long will it take before the customer is dissatisfied with it?"
bad,The way they pay and treat their employees on a national level is likened to slavery. They should be ashamed.
bad,I hated it the bosses were all bullies.  The work environment was hostile at best.
bad,"low pay, no direction, good workers love to help customers,mnanagment not on same page"
bad,"If I could give negative stars I would.. Benefits were lousy, salary was lousy - wages were frozen, no job advancement - people were never promoted from within, positions were always filled from outside, had 1 decent manager who left to pursue more viable options, which is when I left as well."
bad,This store no longer exists. It closed in 2012. It was fun while I was there. The staff was great and the environment was very laid back.
bad,stocking walking and standing as well as watching movies was a great job for a teen
bad,"they would only schedule all the employees for like 3 maybe 4 hours, which made it difficult to even want to drive there for the small pay/ hours"
bad,"I didn't enjoy it, they hire unqualified people and they have no room for advancment."
bad,They lie to you just to get you hired. Management are a bunch of idiots who violate there own policies. There aren't any raises but they claim during the interview that they have yearly reviews for raises. Everyone there is rude and if your not then you wont fit in. 
bad,"The management could care less about you.  They don't care about customer service, they only care about numbers. "
bad,"I enjoyed stocking, ordering, an making transactions that was fun to be around positive people everyday "
bad,For a part time Job it is not a bad company to work for. They don't pay employees very much
bad,"No advancement, low pay.  No resources for learning.  High turn over"
bad,"They treat you like you are not human, expect the world from you but hate you when you show them up and fire you the moment you can receive benefits."
bad,The POS system is so old that customers get very frustrated. The shop your way rewards is a joke. The company will not hire anymore full time so you can't receive any good health benefits. 
bad,"Backroom associate, lifting heavy stuff,NO forklift, work at night by yourself, no one to help load for customers"
bad,Horrible place to work the pay is minimum wage no advancement possible. Management is Ok. you are worked to death only to make minimum wag with no possibility to move up in the company.
bad,managers who dont know how to do thier job and people who dont know how to control thier temper as in co workers just horribe
bad,"management wasn't diverse. power gets to them."
bad,they are on a pay freeze so dont look for a raise. managers do not respect any of thier employees  
bad,The management was awful. I would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,The sears in the North Woods Mall is a horrible place to work. The managers are rude and don't lead by example. The communication is bad and the pay sucks.
bad,There was not much of a challenge. I love working with the customers but the management wasnt very supportive and they were very disorganized.
bad,The store I worked at had extremely large turn over.  Most people only lasted a few months before quitting.  The management was terrible and it was extremely boring and not challenging at all.
bad,"They will give poor reviews even though you jump thier hoops and complete projects, come in on days off and work holidays, They are not a good place to work for, dont pay well. They do not give equal pay for equal positions. They give excusses not to give a raise."
bad,Commission rates are terrible and no room for growth.  Management expects too much for what they pay.  Saw good employees get fired and bad employees get promoted
bad,bad to work for low pay work you so hard do not work in the back room they want so much very bad place to work
bad,There is alot to do for this job. I found that trying to get the customers to get the rewards cards was extremely difficult and didnt like that you had to get so many to stay employed.
bad,"Management is generally comprised of unqualified people. Paperwork through the roof. The computer systems setup are from the 70""s. Nobody knows the answer to any important questions. The only thing the company seems to care about is spamming customers with emails and selling ""Protection Agreements"" which ARE major rip offs."
bad,NO money long hours and management did a poor job!!!I It was the worst I could have better off at mcdonalds.
bad,"Sears was a very busy place even when we did not have customers. There was always something to do which I enjoyed the most, but the staff and management were very rude and not helpful at all."
bad,"I have worked at Sears for two years and it was a very hard job to keep focus on while still trying to live outside of work, the compensation was set so low that I paid more to get to work than I received in my checks. I worked long hours and would often be asked to stay which I did but never received praise or advancement from my many hours of overtime that I was never paid for."
bad,Sears is a horrible place to work I was for two years. They don't give raises or let you grow with the company. Management discriminates against tattoos
bad,I was there for three years. i didnt like it they treated thier employees horribly.
bad,"CPI doesn't care about it's employees at all. Laid off all of their employees, nation-wide, on the morning we all showed up."
bad,"everything about sears was basically poor. From the early morning meetings that are essentially pointless, to the irritationg focus on the SHOP YOUR WAY REWARDS PROGRAM......"
bad,"With absolutely 0 training before hitting the sales floor I was forced to rely on my previous work experieces and make the most of it. Even today almost 4 months later I am being reprimanded for company policies of which I was never told of and were never brought to my attention. In regard to normal everyday transactions I am continuously having to rely on my fellow employees for assistance. This is no exaggeration. To this day, I still do not have the information to successfully page a manager using their phone system. I have been the victim of Sears knowingly using their commission employees for cheap labor blaming their inability to schedule MCAs on their ""LRQs"" or Labor Requirement #'s, other practices include using company break policies as excuses for the scheduling of employees for longer time while paying for the same # of hours as without a break. Everyday I am angered more and more by every single manager taking more than 20 minutes to respond to calls for help by people in every department because the entire management team spends more time outside smoking than they do on the job. Sears will go down as the worst company I have EVER worked for, and it comes as no surprise why economists have Sears named for one of the top companies that will not exist in 18 months. Currently I actually cannot afford to work for this company any longer. And look forward to my last day working for this company."
bad,"This was the worst place I have worked for to date. The management was unprofessional, the training was non-existent when it came to company programs and policies, as well as new approaches. They would penalize you for not doing it the correct way, then after doing so finally show you what they expected. It was the same on everything from credit programs to daily routines. This did not include the common sense and practical applications of the workplace, which was sometimes irrelevant to what they wanted as the corporation would refuse to admit that their methods were poorly executed and simply blame management and the blame would roll downhill. Simply put, no one took responsibility and simply passed the buck. The methods they would try to instill were those of a company looking to stay afloat without really doing much. When I was refused to see what the percentage of my commissions were they simply replied ""They are in constant flux , so we cannot show you"". I was refused commission on repeated situations as it would be excuses such as ""We didn't train you on this yet, so we cant give you commission on that product""... so I contacted the human resources department and was told that this is retail and sometimes getting run over comes with the job. Then I called corporate and was told they did not handle pay issues and I would have to speak with my stores hr representative. This is definitely this worst company I have worked for. Im glad they are losing the Craftsman contract"
bad,"South center mall sears in Tukwila at first prevailed 20 hour work weeks. the holiday displays and new product were a lot of fun to manage. Management here was nice but nonexistent. No proper guidance or direction. Communication was lacking constantly. Some co workers were nice but most were rude never properly introduced themselves prior to yelling or complaining. The hardest part of this job was being trained incorrectly and pulled from the schedule without notice or reason. I most enjoyed helping customers and sorting clothes for the holidays, the clientele is so cheerful during these times."
bad,Management is terrible. If you can manage to stay away from them you will be ok. District management is very helpful and fun to work with. Store level is BAD.
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had. There was very little, if any training. Management was so unresponsive, it was pathetic. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I can understand why the company is failing."
bad,Work for sears only if you have no self esteem at all.
bad,"When I was interviewed I was told I got commission and tha the job would be demanding ad fast paced. However once I accepted I found out that I don't get commission, thejob is boring as all hell and the only thing demanding about it is How much the managers want you to go play cashier all the time. It's not worth my time for the pay. Never ever work here. There's also the favoritism. As long as you kiss major butt you can't get fired. Not even for fraud. If you don't they will do everything they can to get rid of you."
bad,"Cashiers are evaluated as to how many ShopYourWayRewards are processed, not on the hard work or great customer service they provide. My hours were cut so bad because of the rewards program, that I had to quit. I did enjoy all my co-workers and miss them. Management never had any positive feedback for the cashiers, and was never hesitant to provide negative feedback."
bad,The way the. Treat employees that have worked hard for years is disgusting.
bad,"40yr old office space with mold and mildew. No heat, no air in the summer. Everyone there has worked there for 20 to 42 yrs and unwilling to change their complacent behavior. Management could use an overhaul and bring in people with educations and experience."
bad,Didnt like working here they treat their employees bad and dont care for them.
bad,The management is terrible. They do not give raises and do not give you enough hours to sustain a living. Sometimes you get 3 hrs a week.
bad,"Management has a close-door policy. Training for cashiers is a ""sink or swim"" process. If you have a question for management, you are made uncomfortable for asking."
bad,"Filing documents. Routing technicians to destinations, speaking with customers and clients to build them custom packages,handled taking payments, filing, working with Excel, Word, and other office programs, making marketing calls. Upholding the utmost excellence in customer service."
bad,learned about management
bad,"Horrible! Don't even bother. Not really sure who runs this company. I worked for Sears in the early 90's and went back thinking this was the same great company. Big mistake. The hr department is in India, they give all, and I mean all of your information to India, such as your social security number, and birth date. I was in Tucson Az call center. They treat there customers really bad. I felt my integrity was being compromised, I have to avoid the outsourcing question, customers don't like it. DON'T DO IT"
bad,Sears does not care about either their customers or employees
bad,It was a growing experience. Would not recommend this company to anyone unless they are completely desperate for work.
bad,"Very disappointed in the way the manager handled my medical situation. I had all the paper work documenting why I was unable to be at work, and they did all they could to make sure I was unemployed by the time I physicians wrote the paperwork for me to be able to go back to employment."
bad,A day at work consists of talking with co-workers and staring at the floor as there are not many customers that frequent the store. Management sets unachievable goals that are based on numbers when the store was doing well. Co-workers loathe job and barre it because they have nowhere else to go. Most enjoyable part is leaving said job.
bad,"This is as close to modern day slavery as it gets. 12-15 hour days with low pay, lots of driving"
bad,And this reciprocated by them on me.
bad,"Another example of corporate America. The lack of personality and any sense of humanity, as a result of adherence to the homogenized rules of an out of control, vacuous system is astounding. Workers are kept on a leash for minimum wage, never knowing when or for how long they will work in a week. This is the way the modern corporate treats its workers: as cattle. Boycott the stores and never, never encourage anyone to work in such a place. The dehumanization of the working class is in full-swing."
bad,Management wants the associate to force credit card applications on people who cannot afford them. Always trying to push products that the customer doesn't need. Never completed services on time.
bad,"that ok for job lots helper and unload part time i don,t like change schedule."
bad,"they fogot ,what it like to care about their employee who work hard for them many years ,was a great place to work in the pass but things have change,I can only hope that they improve and get back to being the great company they use to be."
bad,the worst hvac company ever they will threaten your job everyday if you don't sell anything If they don't like you they will bother you They get new managers every year no one knows how to run an hvac department there and their prices are threw the roof so its hard to sell
bad,"Pay too little, barely no hours, not worth it. Only good for a person starting their first job"
bad,"worst place to work at with rude co workers , bad managers not a safe place to work at breaks where to long for some employee""s"
bad,Seasonal job during the holiday season. Stocking and unloading trucks
bad,I handled cash and learn how to better my customer service skills.i worked seasonal so it was very hectic because it was the holidays and the hours we're very bad
bad,i liked helping people and selling new appliances but the owner wasnt so nice she was very hard to work for
bad,"This Job was not very Friendly,"
bad,"Loved working with customers, no room for advancment at this company, they are horrible to their employee's and the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Disliked the leadership, it was more slave labor"
bad,"The pay is ridiculous, management and everyone is horrible"
bad,"Let just about anybody take ""professional pictures"" and cheat customers out of money + deals."
bad,"Didn't ever like it, except for during the training period which was all computer based."
bad,"auto center manager - responsibilites from hiring and firing to getting called in the middle of the night because the alarm went off to dealing with an overflowing toilet, job should pay at least double, not to mention being LIED to about commission/salary. never received a commission yet the store was doing ""so much better""..continually heard ""oh you just missed your commission by a fraction of a percent"". i just can't say enough negative things about sears, i will never step foot in any sears - not to mention i would never trust work being done on my car by your employees simply because a better tech would have a better job!"
bad,"I was not there very long. One reason was the Manger that was running loss prevention left without notice before I was able to take the loss prevention test. I was not able to do any more their. While i was there though I was taught shrink reports, inventory reports, work the security camera's, detect shoplifters, and their suspicious behaviors."
bad,"Sears Home Improvements is absolutely the worst place to work, the only thing they care about is the bottom line. They do not care about the employee at all and will send you driving 3 hours in one direction (using your own vehicle) for a 2 to 3 hour appt, then have you drive, another hour or so to another appt., then have you drive back to where you started for yet another appt! This is a 14 - 16 hours day with at least 6 or 7 hours of drive time! They re-imburse a minimal amount per mile which won't even cover your gas expense. If you are lucky enough to sell a job at their highly inflated prices, they will attempt to keep part or all of your commissions by claiming the job was mis specked and you the employee will pay the difference from your commissions! They also require you to work all day on Saturdays, which could be one of those 14 hour days. They give you minimal product training and send you out to the wolves, then when mistakes are made they deduct from your pay. You are basically on your own with only the other reps to rely on since the management never answers their phones or returns messages, and rarely returns emails. You are just a number to them, and if you are in the bottom 20% of ""closers"" you will be fired. No questions asked. Good luck!"
bad,"Working with others is something that i like, at Sears representatives are kind and respectful."
bad,Had almost 10 years with company.For almost three years we have not received a raise.They have increased our to do list.Not worth working here.
bad,"it was horrible, bad bosses, bad management, revolving door of employees"
bad,A typical day at work was hard nd pressure. I learned that customers are always right. I learned you have to bit your tongue in a customer service field. The management was out of control. The co-workers were very nice and helpful.The hardest part of the job was learning the cash register and the system of the company. The most enjoyable part of the part was the recognition of co-workers who was signing people up for credit
bad,"my co-workers were all terrific and extremely helpful. Everyone worked as a team although there was alot of tension between the techs and the customer service advisors. Being a tech was great, it was definitely the most physically demanding job and most time consuming job but the customer service adviser had the most stressful job on the planet."
bad,Not having enough to do
bad,"The typical work day in the warehouse/Merchandise pick up is taking care of the customers, unloading trucks of Goods and what ever else the management deems as your job. mostly part time positions. your co-workers are great as long as there not management. I learned how to take a lot of verbal abuse from management and there are no pay raises period.there is a lot of associate turn over. you get paid every 2 weeks into you checking account and if you don't have a checking account the company sends you a sort of debit card like a prepaid visa card that they continue to fill every 2 weeks. you only get benefits if you are full time If you are thinking about taking a job here think again its not worth it."
bad,A place where shifts were not run in an organized manner and discrimination against workers was allowed.
bad,"This company practiced poor customer service and I was displeased with their employees work ethnics. I, myself did an outstanding job at performing their work task as everyone else barely did their job."
bad,they dont work their employees they dont pay them enough for what the do
bad,upper management doesn't care about it's employees nor their quality of life mix between home and work. district & regional managers are the most unperson-able individuals they could find. the store management work schedules are ridiculous and the stores are run by grandfathered in old men who don't follow company policy. I worked 6 hard long years without a raise in compensation and transferred to a location with the expectation (through district manager coaching) of making a name for myself only to be part of the staff cuts as they closed the location 1 years later. this company is at deaths door.
bad,for a teenager highschool drop out
bad,I would not recommend this company. Nothing in stock no new tech. When you call HR it is out sourced over seas. Old regs. ect.
bad,"Slow, unproductive because of uneducated managers. The new managers are somewhat better but i dont like this job or company."
bad,For a large company they really have no consideration for their front line people
bad,"Poor customer service and even worse treatment of the employees, if that is possible."
bad,"I was a photo studio manager for three years at various Sears Portrait Studio locations from Seattle to Memphis. I felt like my associates and I were on a sinking battelship being overtaken by crazy corporate policies. The final straw was when the District Manager told me to do something that corporate told me not to do. I told her that I called and checked with corporate and she informed me that regional policy trumps corporate policy. The expectations are more than unreasonable and the hours worked are scheduled in the weirdest manner. Literally, who goes to work from 10-2 and then takes an hour lunch between 2-3, finally coming back at 3 to close shop? I you're a portrait studio emplyee, YOU WILL!"
bad,Company that doesnt care about there employees. They looked for any and all that you could do wrong
bad,"In store marketing supervisor of seven stores...managers treated the marketers like lepers and while interviewing a prospective employee the manager physically dragged him from the office. Contacted HR and nothing was done...thats the ""flavor"" of the entire corporation."
bad,sears is a quiet steady environment however the stress of credit apps having your job threatened everyday is just too much.
bad,Called existing and potential customers and discussed the benefits of SearsProtection Agreements.Met quota of weekly Protection Agreement sales and renewal.Answered inquiries regarding Protection Agreement and repair and replacementprocedures.Trained and managed Twenty Eight Sales Reps and achieved significantimprovements in their productivity.
bad,"I have worked for them for over a year and there has already been two different store managers, and several assistant store managers and most of the managers don't hold things confidential-everyone knows everyone's personal business. There was one assistant manager that was nice, but she left about a month ago. The store manager was always giving her dirty looks, and I even witnessed the store manager talking down to her a couple of times when i would go on breaks. They go through associates all the time because of how the store manager treats people-talks down to people-yells at them. Most Department Leads and Managers are rude and unethical. One of the managers was bragging about a raise they had gotten, nice to hear when we don't get raises. I have had people who have been there for a long time tell me that they have not given raises to hourly associates for four years. I am looking for a different job."
bad,"This job was all about overwork and underpay. there is absolutely no room for improvement, and the management team will let you know. There is no pride or teamwork within the company and the stores themselves."
bad,•A typical day at work **Not very pleasant
bad,The bottom line is how many credit cards you sale. They have shady schemes on how to get rid of employees and they have low tolerence or patients for improments.
bad,The sears i used to work at was very slow and almost going out of business. I didnt get a lot of hours and the management and coworkers were very unfriendly.
bad,21 years of working for them....at first it was GREAT...but after the sears/kmart merger....it SUCKED!!!!...the pay ESPECIALLY...
bad,Bad Business - Bad News - No wonder they closed. There was basically no structure - and no management team in place.
bad,"Sears was not the best job ever. It is good for a high school student looking for extra money, but even at that it is not worth it. Management is bad and although many people blame the work place and staff, I am serious! I worked there for one and a half year and I am confident that I was the best at my job, but they do not show appreciation. I believe that a workplace should be enjoyed. If a job gets boring, your attitude and work ethic tends to reflect. I decided it was time to look for a better job with benefits and better pay."
bad,I felt left out in many ways.I don't think there was a strong work ethic running in that work place.
bad,"The workload far exceeeds the pay Sears offers. The managers treat employees like dirt and make up more work than what is initially required. This company needs to realize that once you keep your employees satisfied, then the customers will be taken care of. I have never worked for a company where they talk down about you (especially the Managers) amongst other co-workers and Managers. My co-workers and I get along great and we all work hard to help each other so we can get out at a decent time."
bad,I worked here for 3 months and had been harassed so much that I just had to resign.
bad,My day of work was working on cars. I really didnt learn much since i grew up working on cars at my dads garage.Management wasnt that nice to me he had an additude problem.My co-workers was the best.Hardest part of job was lifting heavy tires all day.The most enjoyable part of job was going home.
bad,Don't Bother!
bad,I Learned more cashiering experiance. It was extremely unproffesional.
bad,The management was not fair nor were they very nice. Some co-workers also didnt work as a team.
bad,if you like work place drama... enjoy. I personally could not handle it and had to leave very quickly because i couldnt bite my tongue for much longer before my leave.
bad,Management will mislead employers and act very unprofessional
bad,"They dont care about family needs, management and scheduling is a joke. The ENTIRE job was a waste of time."
bad,"Co-worker often lazy, management was not organized at all, pay and hours were as low as it gets for all departments other then management, response to threats and miscommunication are almost nothing."
bad,Expected to do more than 2 people's work.
bad,"As a company, there is no loyalty or respect for its employees. They switch out managers by the month and allow the management to abuse the staff - place unrealistic expectations on department staff and terminate them when they don't meet them regardless of tenure. The company allows the store to operate without essential needs to save money. The hierarchy of managers leave the cashiers and sales reps to fend for themselves on the sells floor; they don't respond to complaints and concerns from customers or their staff. And altogether the company does not pay enough to compensate for the abuse employees endure."
bad,Required to talk to 20-30 people an hour and set up appointments with 5-10 per hour. High pressure to succeed in a depressed economy.
bad,"Revolving door, always looking for new employees. poor management, no products to sell. Going out of business"
bad,"A typical day at Sears includes but is not limited to negative and poor motivation, too much to do in a given day and not enough time or opportunities to complete it and the management acting out in some way due to personal problems with employees."
bad,A typical day at work is the same at Sears as it is at any other retail workplace. Management can be good or bad.... it is hit or miss because management tends to change hands often. My co-workers were mostly high school kids that didn't seem to care too much about doing the job and doing it right. The hardest part of the job was the picking up the slack from everybody else so that things got done.
bad,"I was miserable here. Some of the managers are great, but the store manager has a focus on numbers. He is a salesmen and everything else is pushed to side. The sales requirements are constantly increasing even in non sales departments."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer. the hardest of m job was around chistmas because it's busy that time of year, your trying to stay on top of everything."
bad,it was good money when cars came in to be worked on. when it got slow you made no money.
bad,"Log-in and begin helping customer with complaints,I learned to place myself in that customers shoes so that each call I would give them the best help possible.Management was poor. The hardest part of the job was not having enough information to help the customer and not being able to get service in a timely manner.My co-workers under the conditions in which we all worked in made coming to work a pleasure.The most enjoyable part of the job is when an 80 yr old calls in with temps in the 100's with no air and has a health condition and with luck I can have a tech come out same day instead of 2 weeks later."
bad,"Your successes will be forgotten, and your failures will be noted."
bad,typical day at wor would be open store prepre sales floor verify banks into registers. welcome and greet all costumers and tend to there every need question or concern push criedt applications and up sale merchindise
bad,low pay hot and boring work in a tire shop customers are extremely picky
bad,Great place many advancement opportunities and a very nice atmosphere.
bad,The management staff does not care about their associates at all. You can get fired after one bad day. No pay increases at all. little change of advancement.
bad,to many cheifs not enough indians everybody wants to be a manager !
bad,"Sears is not the company you want to be employed by. There is no attendance policy. They change all of the policies all the time. Management changes the minute hand on the clock. Very poor training. There is absolutely no job security, let alone room for professional development."
bad,"I was a Home Improvement Sales Consultant and Sears was the worst company ever worked for ""This is not the company your grandparent, parent and maybe you grew up with."" The management is only after what is in it for themselves, they don't care if they TAKE ADVANTAGE OF the customer, the sales people, the installers, who ever it takes. They bleed the elderly customs who remember the old SEARS with great warranties and good products, they want the salespeople to high pressure them into buying over price home improvements with the same product they can get at the local big box home improvement store. The sales person is to convince the customers the products are only available from SEARS, that Sears uses their on installers which they don't (they use subcontractors that homeowners can also find if they do their own research). All warranties have loop holes that protect Sears. A LOT OF THE INCOME SEARS HOME IMPROVEMENT MAKES IS FROM TAKING BACK PART OF THE COMMISSIONS FROM THE SALESPEOPLE WITH SOME LAME EXCUSE THAT THEY PRICED THING WRONG. ### THE BEST PART IF A CUSTOMER IS OVERCHARGED THE SALESPERSON LOSES PART OF HIS COMMISSION AND SEARS DOES NOT REFUND THE CUSTOMER!!! WIN-WIN FOR SEARS ONLY AVOID THEM AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I worked here two years part time and could not get full time but the store manager hired a kid full time that was just as good as me in sales.They would schedule me 2 hours a day 5 days a week pathetic.My whole team was fired for nothing and we were replaced with kids that were starting out in sales.
bad,"A typical day-- is wondering what going to happen next. What you learn --- notting, management ,I dont have a nice comment, -- your co-workers , the reason why you want to get up and go in to work , --the hardest part of the job , is workin hard doing your best but only the lasy one's get the better pay and they recongnized them ,the most enjoyable part of the job is , get to work with the people you love,"
bad,"No one knows what they're doing. Management is systematically dismantling the company by selling off the assets and people are being laid off in groups as this is happening. Or if they don't want to lay you off, they just charge you with a flat out lie and then fire you. The only good part of this company was the beautiful campus at Hoffman estates, and the cafeteria! Other than that, there's nothing good to say about this company. Don't even CONSIDER working here."
bad,Assist customer when in need of help and also clean my area of concentration clean.
bad,This was a great place if it had better management. the job was too easy and the pay wasnt good enough
bad,"The most enjoyable thing was selling appliances, talking to new customers on the phone and on the store floor"
bad,a typical day at work was working five to eight hours alone loading large merchandise alone.
bad,"The 1st five years I was proud to be part of the Sears team, I learned alot and grew as a tech. The last 4 years, management changed everyting and caused difficulties in all aspects of our jobs."
bad,there is no room for advancement .pay raise is non existent.
bad,"I loved working there. I really did. But they put all this pressure on you as a cashier to get so many credit applications and in this day with the economy, tat was quite difficult to do. I worked so hard ad did everything i was supposed to do. But b/c i didn't make a certain quota, they let me go. I told them that people were getting the applications the wrong way and lying to customers bc other cashiers have seen it but they didnt care. Because they were making there quota, they didn't care people were lying to customers or falsifying information. I liked the co-workers and and every part of the job but that. I was glad to leave if that is how they wanted to run there business."
bad,The company is in disarray. No process works well. The upper management puts more emphasis on side programs like signing people up for shop your way rewards and sending emails to lost customers than sales.
bad,"I didn't like working there at all you never got a day off,the benefits were horrible."
bad,13-16 hour days with no apreciation from senior managment. Declining business wiht no aspiration to advance into the future.
bad,When i just started working at sears i have enjoy working there one day a customer walk in she did not know what she looking for so i have to help to fine it.my co-work are fun to be around they help each other out. there are no hardest part of a job if u put your mind to it you can do it..
bad,No one really wanted to help out on the team. I was constantly left with the phone because I was new and I never knew what to say or do.
bad,"Old faulty equipment, little or no stock, unobtainable goals, threats,"
bad,"Before getting hired in, I informed them that I was going to school full time, and that they would need to work around my school schedule. They continued to schedule me during class up until the day that they fired me for missing too many days, because it was more important that I attend class."
bad,If your a teen yeah great job.Come and go as you please.But if your old love people hard worker this is not a place for you.Instant stress.Worried you'll be fired.But the lazy ones give sob stories and why you do their work theyre gossiping or shopping in the mall.Sears pays for those employees.And then there are the ones who do worst that buddy you.Its like a huge bad soap opera.I feel if you working as your surpose too.Who has time for gossip or drama.$7.25 an hours they work you why others play.Seek out your employees see why your failing.I dare you visit your Independence MO Mall store for a month.You will see some shady stuff.
bad,"This company is horrible when it comes to tasks, every manager thinks they are the boss which unprofessional and yet they got no manners. They suck."
bad,"I got paid 8.20 after i had been there over a year, and before i quit they were only giving 4 hours a wek to the asociates on my team."
bad,"I have worked for this company for several years, and over that time I have seen a lot of changes for the worse..... Very little pay increases, many positions were eliminated due to sales numbers not shrink numbers. Full time is 30 hrs felt like part time hours. Security does more customer service roles than catching people who steal. No concern for life balance wanted you to put company first. pay could be better to keep associates longer, To much pressure on associates to sell replacement plans, (which btw are a waste of money and are 100% profit for the company). I am glad that I am not working for this company now... At the rate that they are closing stores, I think Sears will not be around within the next five years.."
bad,"Always changing company looking for new strategic intiatives that support the companies growth. Management has limited patients on project completion timelines, any hurdles, or testing programs prior to rolling out nationally."
bad,"The job was very laid-back, they did require you to meet alot of expectations."
bad,Bad place to work treat you horribly pay is bad never positive to employees
bad,Management and leadership of organization are purely focused on cost control and cutting cost throughout organization. Not a good place to be for the driven and motivated employee.
bad,"This position was not very pleasant. It started out being somewhat enjoyable, and offered bonuses that made the low wage base somewhat bearable. After awhile they removed the bonuses and reduced everyone's wages 10%. That was to make their company look good on the books so they could sell. It was very unfair to the employees."
bad,only worked as a temporary driver. for one summer to make some money.
bad,This was the worst place ever to work for. while there you are pressured to keep unrealistic goals. they don't understand if you child is sick and needs a day off to care of family.
bad,"worked for this company for about 5yrs, within those 5yrs, I received a .25 cent raise, and a .24 cent raise, that gave me a .49 cent raise within 5yrs of work, company is more focused on techs selling products and pertection agreements rather than fixing and repairing, if a tech sales more products and warranties they are more appraised than a tech that would complete 5 + calls a day on their route, sears has also come up with a way to change metrics every 6months so when your yearly reviews come up, you don’t qualify for a raise and if you get a raise, it’s about .20cents....very horrible routes, sometimes I would drive 1hr to my first call, then may head south to do a call, then head back up north to do a call that is another 1hr away, and all calls would be am calls for example, if you’re not selling you’re not productive basically and we are in the business of fixing and repairing products, can’t say enough about management, I was very let down by this company, if you want to be a service tech, this is not the company to have a career with, I’ve seen techs that have been with company 30plus years be treated like garbage, thought I would have an outstanding career with this company when in fact, this is the worst job I’ve ever wanted to get up in the morning and go to..........."
bad,while working at sears it was a good company i measured coustmers for glasses fill rx do pa announcments and the best thing i liked was working for commision
bad,"I started working part time in the warehouse, worked up to part-time sales, then to full-time sales and was promoted to the Floor Sales Manager. I gave the Kingman Sears my all!"
bad,"I held my possition for over 7 years. I was hired to over see 1 product and as time went by, I was assigned 4 additional products, all exterior. I received no help from the managers trying to hit the numbers corporate wanted, which were impossible to hit. The managers always said they would find a way to spread the products over the production team but never did. I worked 6, many weeks 7 days a week to try to accomplish what was told I had to do but was unable to do so, just not enough time to handle 5 exterior products during the bussy seasone. I was told every week to do whatever it took to hit their numbers. Installers refused to work for Sears because of the reduction in the pay scale and they were going to reduce it even further."
bad,"This company is in trouble and not in touch with reality. This is evident in the massive decline in stock value the past few years. Management does not understand how to lead. They bully and coerce to meet their own goals. They do not accept the fact that that employees have needs. This company only recognizes statistics, which they create and change to use against employees. This particularly applies to the STAC unit managed by Fogle."
bad,"Company was always in chapter 11, everyday wondering if they are going to just close the doors. Great people, work was not bad, but company outlook just horrible."
bad,No room for advancement or job promotions. Poor customer service tactics. Hours were based on which ever cashier was able to push the most credit card applications.
bad,Protection agreements are à joke    Always getting in trouble if not meeting goals   Sucks sucks hours suck   Suck  manager a jerk  always thinking he is right
bad,"I have worked here for a long time and though I love the people I work with, the people in the higher places here are awful. I am disrespected often by the people in charge. These people are very apathetic, and I feel that has to do with their souls slowly leaving their bodies over the period they have worked for the company. This company does not prioritize the customer needs or the needs of their employees. Actually, the company does, but this store does not. I am very underpaid and reap no benefits."
bad,Entre compañeros el nambiente es muy bueno El salario es malo ya que es por comision y si te toca en una tienda donde no hay mucho movimiento de clientes pues a la quincena te las vas a ver dificil. Aparte que las horas de trabajo son mas de 10 y en ventas especiales te tienes que quedar en orarios que pasan de las 10pm. En conclusion muchas horas para un pobre pago
bad,"no capacitan, no apoyan al personal"
bad,"The managers don't care about the employees or the customers, just the company. "
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE! I was harassed by this company. They do not follow standards against discriminatory behavior. I tried to report a case of harassment and they told me I was a liar, although this manager I had reported had been reported by every worker still there. They do not care about staff nor family emergencies. They let go of me exactly two months after training because of my sex and they had the audacity to ask me to close afterwards! A HORRIBLE company to work for and no one should be in such a miserable work environment. This place is crook and not worth your time in the long run. No employee discount or nothing. This place should’ve been closed."
bad,"Poor all around... between management, corporate, and trying to accomplish things that are completely unrealistic and impossible. I would never go back..."
bad,"Pay was decent but the long hours, horrible vehicles, upset customers, lack or resources (safe vehicles, tools, parts, machine diagrams, management). Just avoid and put your energy into something meaningful."
bad,Not a bad company however I knew tCompany closed sad facehat they were going to close the company down I just got a jump on looking for something else
bad,"Highly Recommend to not go with this organization, as people has been terminated with planning and plotting, Management it's miss match with conditions, HR staff ignored people of Pune location as few teams Handel by HBD location, they don't care about employees."
bad,CEO caused a lot a tension. The only place I’ve worked that I felt I needed to be armed for safety. We had hours cut continuously to keep from making a livable wage.
bad,I was a sales rep that was sold a line of bs about how great the job was and the  Compensation package was. What I wasn't told was how bad the leads were are how much they hit you on your commissions when you do sale for minor things. Also how little they pay for  Mileage. Training is erratic at best get trained by 5 people get told 10 different ways on how things are to be done. Justone o
bad,A company highly reliant on bad data analysis.  My experience as an appliance tech was miserable.  No focus on their customers or employees.  It's been too late.  Don't.
bad,"Poor management, poor payscale. They kept cutting commission from sales to the point where its unlivable. Always strict on trying to get new rewards member making it part of your review. Always trying to get new credit apps out."
bad,"High stress, perform or else. Push add on,s and warranties. Sales goals unrealistic. Upper management was very abrasive. Never felt comfortable or important, you are just a trained monkey to them."
bad,I worked for sears for 3 years at six corners on Irving Park Rd in Chicago. I was 30+ hours until they couldn’t met their metrics goal and cut back hours where I was only working 5hrs for 2-3days only. I got a raise once and after that they wouldn’t offer me anymore or any benefits. They took away pay vacation and sick pay.. after that all that was left was discounts and the discounts was trash they don’t offer much they only take taxes off. Management was poor. They constantly hung out in the Hub office or in their own offices. The leads were always sitting in the lunch room not working and always on their phones .
bad,a typical day at work was slow i dint learn anything here management was scary was ruled by the wick witch of the south workplace was scared of this woman
bad,"Esta empresa promete mucho en su publicidad, pero una de las cosas pésimas que tiene y en todos los sears de la República es que el departamento de Rh se cree el jefe de todos los departamentos y se mete mucho, jefes inmediatos indolentes, preferencias por gente. Tardan en manejar tu solicitud, si no te dan el trabajo y preguntas porque, solo te dicen que tu psicometria no salió bien y no eres elegible. Rh es prepotente y deja mucho que desear."
bad,"Even if it weren’t a sinking ship, management, with the exception of 1 lead, is abysmal. No vacation time, no pto, no benefits. Still owed money for severance."
bad,"Located in the mall, first management crew was actually great, cared about the associates and the store, the next crew came in and were truly aweful. Minimum wage, aged graphics, no air conditioning."
bad,"ok to work for this company."
bad,"From the managers down to the associates, Sears has been by far the most unprofessional place to work at. The managers will talk bad about fellow managers or fellow associates in front of you or customers. There is unrealistic quotas that need to be hit such as a certain amount of sales per hour or certain amount of credit apps per shift which is difficult when there are no customers in the store. If you don't achieve these expectations your hours are cut and usually a new associate is hired with little to no training. The associates are immature high schoolers or elders who hate their job. I wasted years of my life working for a company that did not allow room for associates to grow or be promoted."
bad,We all knew Sears was dying. The associated arent going to go above and beyond for the pay they get. It's like hanging on to the titanic and watching it slowly sink.
bad,This job was one that actually made me hate working there. No chance to advance and everyone already working there did not care if the company was going under
bad,What can a person say about a company that lied to their customers and employees every day? This company was hard to work for. There was one set of rules for the upper management and one for the floor staff
bad,"No room for advancement. Company almost always hires from the outside so there are no opportunities for promotion. Pay is minimum wage with the false hope of earning commisssion. If you don't make minimum wage through commission, you fall into the negative, so the next time you make over minimum wage you have to pay back to get yourself out of the negative. Customer service is a joke - you can't solve any problems for a customer, you have to refer them to a 1-800 number for any issues, even most refunds. Customer base is toxic, uninterested, or unappreciative."
bad,I helped customer with purchases of all sorts.Dealt with  warranties and shipping all around Texas.Made sure each customer expectations were equally met.
bad,"Es una empresa muy buena, te enseña a competir a demostrar cada cualidad  y sobre todo a demostrate tu capacidad de tolerancia y respeto"
bad,"During one of my first few weeks working at the portrait studio, the company was doing a groupon. We were all booked up. Someone called and literally threatened to kill me if I didn't book him in for an appointment when we were all full past the date of expiry. Continued to threaten to come to my store and kill me. Security was called by the other staff in the other in-store kiosk things (optical, travel, etc), the police were called."
bad,Sears is closed down therefore there is very little to write about here.  It was a hardware store and one of the last classic old-school hardware stores with a great tool refund/exchange policy.
bad,"When I started in 2008 it was great, but there was a noticeable decline in product and management in the following years. The last time there was a job fair (wasn't advertised anywhere) the HR lady put a hand written sign (with pen) at ONE of the mall entrances telling interested people to go to the merchandise pickup area (which was located in the back corner of the store). She sat there with a friend watching youtube videos and cackling with a friend that stopped by and eating the snacks that she had gotten for the potential applicants. Needless to say NO-ONE showed up to that event."
bad,"Worked here for a couple of month's in college.  Management was horrible and only cared about store numbers.  Got so bad that I almost got fired for calling out sick on days I didn't feel like going in.  Finally, I gave my 2 week notice once I got hired somewhere else.  Turned me completely off to the world of big retail."
bad,"Not enough SA to work floor, departments.  Much less keep customers satisfied with their dinosaur computer/ registers that lock up, in addition to asking the customer 10 questions before they can make payment.  Loss due to NO PREVENTION of any kind.  No training for minors who don't have a clue.  Ridiculous schedules. 5.5 hr shifts. Barely over min wage.  At that rate you'd think Sears could hire a couple people to monitor the floor for loss prevention.  Stepping over a dollar trying to make a dime.  No wonder Sears in going out of business."
bad,"Unless your a yes person or your best friends with manager, distric manager you are nothing. leaving doors unlocked to the building or leaving people locked in. for the night is ok if if your friends with manager. Horrible insurance no good benefits and over work the employees to do err everything. even as a woman you are to move washers, dryers, refrigerators,  mattresses and ranges by yourself. your no longer able to help members due to lack of inventory or sears allowing you to. Long time ago it was good place to grow and learn."
bad,CEO/owner was literally tearing the company apart and selling it off piece by piece to maximize the profits he could make as opposed to saving a company that could have easily been saved and been turned into something competitive in the retail market going forward.
bad,"When looking at their layout as a whole, they have an AMAZING system set up for success. That being said, I've never heard of a store actually being ON-Process, and this is likely what drove them to bankruptcy. No employee discount, no bonuses, no raises (unless you're a favorite then they submit the help ticket to boost your pay). Raises are easy for management to do, they just won't pick up the phone to call the market HR, or create the help ticket. Spoilers! "
bad,"I'm happy I have a job. I enjoy meeting the customers and helping them find the products that meet their needs, I receive personal fulfillment when that happens."
bad,"You will get calls when your “off” come into work , expect to work over 50 hours a week in management and an upper management who work off of intimidation and complete disconnect between stores."
bad,"Wouldn't really recommend it, pay is terrible. All Sears are slowly but surely shutting down so its not very dependable. Bad management. Pushed for sales that weren't possible. Clientele was rude and expected things of them. Would not work for again."
bad,Company changes direction every 6 months it seems.  They keep cutting staff on the store level and it kills customer service. Company does not have long term future.
bad,Una empresa donde te dicen que ganas entre 7000 y 8000 y ganas 1500 a la quincena
bad,"typical day at work, coming into a store and be told to sell as much as you possibly can despite lack of customers and get scolded for lack of sales."
bad,"Pay depends on how many credit application you can get people to fill out. Very competitive to the point they want to you lie to customers, management is ok but will lower your hour if you don't get enough credit card applications. Very cut-throat, lack of teamwork"
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"Don't do it! Worst decision I ever made. I wasted 14 of years of my life with no pay off . There are no hours , way to many metrics, way way way to much work to  done with no staff to do it. There is no properly working equipment...ever and you'll always feel like to little butter spread over to much bread. They took any discounts we had. And ate constantly doing massive lay offs and I got one raise after 14 years. Oh and they fired me form my fulltime position due to cut backs. But if any of this sounds good to you and your as stupid blind as I am, I'm sure you'll fit in just fine."
bad,"Did not enjoy the work environment, it was stressful and didn't enjoy getting chewed out for doing my job correctly, it made home life very stressful and didn't want to go in the morning"
bad,"Low pay and very stressful, this company only cares about how many credit cards you can push, how many protection agreements you can sell, they do not care about there employee's at all, just there numbers."
bad,"Sears I loved getting out there and involved in their work envirnoment, but the mangement was highly poor. They did not know how to manage none of them had manger backgrounds and were there for all wrong reasons. But co-workers and work environmnet involving co-workers were amazing"
bad,Sears is the last place you want to work if your an adult. This would be best for a college student or older retiree who doesn't really need a lot of money. They start you off at minimum wage ($7.25) and they wont give a raise unless you get promoted to a higher position. The hours each week are inconsistent & they will send you home in a heartbeat. They took away employee discounts. So you really just get paid bare minimum with no benefits if your part time. Other than paid time and half on holidays. They don't let you go overtime or you get written up. They make you do work outside of your job description. I was a merchandising associate doing a cashiers job.
bad,"It is a really good thing that it closed! I shouldnt do a review since it doesnt matter anymore but why not?"
bad,"This job was my first and difficult because company closed store. I had difficulties getting time off. "
bad,"This has to be the worst  mangement team I have ever seen. Just messy with everything they do. Pay, benefits and insurance is all bad . No raises. Lack it structure with the home services escalations . The mangers are bad, turn over is very high due to the poor environment mangement has created. Trying to get help from HR was a waste of time, our rep spent 90% of the day in her cell phone. Could never get an answer from her she had to find out and never followed up.  I would avoid Home services. There are better jobs out there. Sears is going down hill fast and working there I see why."
bad,"Spent excessive amount of time dealing with irate customers. Store was severely understaffed resulting in employees working in areas they were not assigned. As my job performance (sales numbers) improved, my work hours decreased. Work environment unstable and unsure as Sears continues to close stores. Not a good place to work."
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had, for sales associate they get paid $6.50 and cashier paid $7.25.  Mgmt was very hateful and they know they can get away with it.  They would yell at you so loud that you have to hold the phone away from your ear.  They would get anger with you in front of the customer and even if it was not your fault they would come and chew you out.  If your lead tells you to clock in early then your manager would watch you and reject it even if you had permission.  There were so many cut throat people it was unreal!  They would play games and tell you one thing and the next day they would tell you something else.  This is not a good store."
bad,"The company and store felt like it was fighting an uphill battle against a changing time, they were stuck in a time when everyone depended on them for products, but times have changed. The store I worked at refused to change product lines, sales tactics, or locations to advance the company’s profit."
bad,"Managers were terrible and ALWAYS pushed credit cards when we were slow paced and only got regulars. My first day working here consisted of me working by myself, with no training. I was the only cashier in softlines and managers didn't answer when I called for help."
bad,"You can tell why they are going out of business. They don't pay well enough for a good standard of life, and all of the best sales people leave this company to go some place that they will be paid what they are worth."
bad,"The left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing."
bad,dying company.  leave before they close.  Kids will keep working here until the end because the company is horrible and will hire anyone and expect the world from the employees.  Managers are all looking to jump ship.  Metric driven management style with no incentive to preform.
bad,"a typical day was standing around doing nothing. once you finished straighting your department, which took almost an hour, theres nothing to do. No one shops there so its impossible to meet your credits and percentages."
bad,"Poor Management, high turnover rate. No Support team from owners. they are constantly being bought out. Employees are not trained properly and not friendly"
bad,It was a nightmare working there after I had a baby. No work life balance. They gave me such a hard time to get my maternity leave. My manager was not willing to mentor me. In fact she used to feel threatened by me. HR used to create more hurdles. The harder I worked the more stressful it got for me as they used to give me more work.
bad,there wasn't enough work to keep you busy for 8 hours and you had other people stealing your sales so you could never get your commission also the manager could never give you a schedule because he was busy taking all the hours for himself to make up for the week he would take off
bad,"The company was once a Stalwart in the Retail industry. Those days are numbered, they keep cutting back and have not given increases for their leadership team in a decade."
bad,"the management was crude and did not seem to care much, everyone seemed miserable, the store is literally going down the drain this company is not worth investing time in."
bad,"When management makes no effort to hire on more employees, you get used to being alone and a stupidly excessive workload, customers are absolute trash, who honestly left me wondering why the store really isn't closed."
bad,"Sears is a very busy company to work for.  The management  teaches you mostly about sales and retail.  The company has many great benefits like Medical, dental, and vision plans you can choose from if you want to purchase the plans."
bad,"It was clear from the get-go that the company was not going to last long. It took them too long modernize their systems and get with the times. They constantly catered to a generation that was getting older and progressively spending less and less."
bad,"Scheduled employees, showcased jewelry, cleaned, polished, and inspected jewelry for any damages and/or lost stones, and received payments for layaway and credit card purchases."
bad,Huge lost opportunity to expand an excellent retail concept as a boutique appliance sales showroom. The archaic Sears work culture was transplanted to a new format that did not require the outmoded training and sales environment that proved ineffective at the mainline company.
bad,"take an over view of the department clean assigned area. greet customers advise  them to products that may fit there needs."
bad,"No room for growth or advancement. No raises in pay; failing company, slow paced working environment, many locations shut down nationwide. Very hard to make a quarter of a living on the pay they give."
bad,A typical day at sears was faster paced. I learned a lot about being a cashier and cash handling experience. Helped prepare me for better retail jobs. Culture was good. The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards. Most enjoyable thing about sears is that there was always something to do.
bad,"They do not care about you as a person. They do not pay well, and there is no clear line of management. I am full time, and it is difficult to get the full eight hours for five days a week. The hours are so bad, that I am on a work- shared program to help pay bills."
bad,"At my time at Sears I feel I was underpaid and overworked. I was only scheduled behind the jewelry counter for shifts within the time frame of not getting a break, and when I worked in the shoe department I was scheduled for long shifts and expected to cover work other people didn't do and didn't train me to do properly. The whole environment was filled with hostility and harassment. I was even reprimanded for missing work to go tot the hospital when I had all the proper documentation with me and orders from my doctor to not return to work until a set date."
bad,The managers are ok. They forget a lot the hours you can and cant work. They put you in times where you cant work. The money is terrible. The only time it is good is the holidays. You'll be lucky to make enough to live off of.
bad,"no career advancement, company doesn't believe in raises.Company wasn't easy to work for.The only way to get a raise was to push their credit cards.Even with the holidays coming up,couldn't get more than maybe 15 hours if your lucky."
bad,it is good as a part time job but I prefer to have job which is related to my studies. The other negative point of working there is its salary which is too low for me.
bad,"I worked at the Kmart in Warren, MI it was dirty as ever made me sick. Management is horrible, they want you to come in excited yet their equipment is old and customers were rude. $8.90 a hour to do a lot of running around. They use people and drain the life out of you. I had to get away from that place because it was depressing and a bunch of nasty folks with nasty attitudes. I just didn't like how they treated folks who actually worked hard. Seems like if you didn't kiss up to management then you were a nobody. Everyone always looked so mean and evil. Place is horrible, warning run away from Kmart in Warren...."
bad,I was working here for a couple months because they decided to spring upon us that they were closing and they had no other jobs to transfer us to to back it up. They never worked with your availability and fired me for not coming in on a day I requested off in advance. The sad thing was they didn't even tell me they let me go I had to come in and see my name crossed up and down the schedule. The hours and working environment was horrible. Never Again
bad,Managers were out for themselves and their bonus rewards for constant cost cuts. Few workers & many managers who really cared anymore.Most feared to be on weekly or monthly downsized lists. Increased workloads force people to focus on costs over service.
bad,"Bad management, store poorly ran, little to no hours, just overall not a fun workplace.  Worked as a cashier and folded clothes after hours it just was not fun.  Hardly anyone to help and everyone puts stuff of on the night crew."
bad,"Depressing place to work. Very few happy faces.lower management has no clue about inspiring people. One in particular rules like a little emperor. They are huge on sears process, and sears process is a proven failure."
bad,"I enjoy the work of merchandising and taking care of customers. It.wasn't always a good environment to work in. No management team work, no consistent communication among management team."
bad,"besides the fact that sears is going out of business, it was a terrible place to work. Pay was bad. I actually made more money as a sales associate then when I was in management."
bad,Overworked due to lack of staff. Won’t hire more staff. Terrible management who only cares about themselves and not their employees. Coworkers are jerks because of stress and hatred of the job.
bad,the hardest part of the job was when there is a long line and one of the customer speaks Spanish and you don't so you have to go find someone who does which slows everything down
bad,"Asset protection was laid off to save the company money, but now the company is rehiring for the position. Working for Sears you will have no job security. I was not even given a heads up about the laying off of the position. I went into work one day and then had no job."
bad,"Ok we're talking about Kmart distribution...this place is horrible! It's slave driven,can't talk,followed to restroom,production rates are impossible but they will use you for as long as they can.Advertise 4 day work week which never happens.you work 6 10hr days with only Sunday off. There 2 months and two supervisors and many associates left.And management has A LOT to be desired,very unfair and unprofessional.Go to upper management with issues about a supervisor and your fired. By far worst job I ever had.Co worker got yelled at for eating a gummy bear..really!"
bad,"Work hours keep increasing for management, plummeting actual staff. There is no job security, you may walk in on any day and discover your location is closing. Management plans change several times/year, as do district and regional managers and district alignments. Company has no cohesive plan to stabilize sales, and has thrown it to the stores for local marketing but provides no budget or schedule support to do so. Benefits cost has increased 350% in seven years"
bad,I lucked up and had two amazing manager's that made the job and its terrible pay tolerable and at times enjoyable. This however is due to the people and not the company which can happen anywhere. I honestly can not say one good thing about the company itself and the poor leadership at the top that is making the whole things come crashing down.
bad,Sears is going down in flames. Don't work here. The work environment is not healthy and the management is completely cut throat. Would never work for them again.
bad,Was laid off.. Constantly moved from one position to another. Lack of consideration in scheduling and also you are constantly working in a high stress environment in which there is always a site visit.
bad,"Sears does not give pay raises ever, mangement has favorites that will advance to a lead position, they are not fair.  The workload is hard but you get little time to do it.  They expect alot out of you and the store suffers for it.  Things get messy because too much is forced out on the floor....all because corporate wants it out.....The best part was the friendship we had...we certain people.   BUT it really wasnt a fair place to work....."
bad,"A typical work day was replacing pricing signs and quadruple checking if prices were right, building displays and bringing merchandise to the floor. I learned that having too much management and upper management is inefficient; one tells you to do something but another says you aren't supposed to do it, then another says you did it wrong even though directions of the first manager was followed correctly. Training was poor and the same problems arose weekly."
bad,"Terrible horrible despicable absolute worst place to work in sales.  My location was sooo slow most of the time, commissions are a joke on everything except extended warranties which nobody really wants"
bad,I loved working for Sears for many years(19+) but in the past couple of years they have changed dramatically from a company who seemed to care about their associates to not at all. They want to change the technical workforce what they hired on for to a sales workforce and the employees doing these technical jobs are either leaving or being performance managed out.
bad,"Hours were entirely dictated by the sale of rewards programs and credit cards. It's unfair to shove unnecessary accessories on customers that clearly don't want them, then deprive employees of hours because they're merely a statistic to management. It didn't matter how courteous, charming, cheerful, and helpful you were - if you wanted hours or advancement of any kind, you had to be a pushy car salesman type and sell credit cards like no tomorrow even when people started protesting. Minimum wage is also unacceptable in this day and age. "
bad,Company is falling apart. Each shift the workload got bigger while your hours were cut to save the company dime. Drastic under-staffing and still expected to meet ridiculous quotas.
bad,"manager would frequently override system to accept returns without receipt or after return period and exchange broken merchandise customers broke because he feared losing customers. "
bad,"Sears is not doing well.  The company is losing money fast and there is no way to combat it.  Techs can work 10 hour days and therefore, management and HR must also put in those hours.  Too many workplace injuries.  No real engagement opportunities, which makes field workers feel less connected.  They wages are incredibly low and they are closing stores and laying people off each years.  It is the typical way a company operates before it goes out of business.  If you need a job for a short while, feel free to apply.  But remember to keep your resume updated and continue to source for better employment.  The benefits are comparable, but still way too expensive.  They support staff get treated worse than field techs with little to no pay increases.  Read up on Sears before you decide to apply.  It is definitely not a place for a career."
bad,"The work was not hard, there were several task to work on, and a lot of time to do it in. However, signing merchandise was time consuming and took away from in coming customers."
bad,"I really don't have too much to say about this company. I do appreciate the job offer. They pay is good. The hours are not so good, I feel that this company should be Mon-Fri."
bad,"Training is backwards. Sales floor; can be cut-throat and ""clickish"" to say the least. Pay-cuts continue. Corporately, out of touch with reality.........................................."
bad,"The morale in the store is very low, and the management team lacks any type of appreciation for their employees, No raises were given in 8 years and yet your job description only increased."
bad,"High turn around rate for management. The second one starts and gets comfortable to make a change, he is fired because he didn't drastically change the company."
bad,"The way that the Store mgr, Operations Manager, and Human Resources mgr. treated the employees was unacceptable.  As a Dept. Lead, we had to work in a store with poor ventilation, and customers were unhappy with the store as well, which made it very hard to make them happy, but we tried. We were given inadequate hours to schedule our associates."
bad,"The bonus is ok "
bad,Terrible management and organization. Very frustrating working here. I would not suggest it. Need a serious restructuring if they want to stay open and make employees happy.
bad,"Sears used to be a good company to work for, it no longer is this prestigious place to work in. I worked there for 12 years and left because it is awful to work for this company. They no longer care about their employees, they are more focused on catching up to their competition."
bad,"Did not like working for this company. There was lack of management after December 2016 and when we did get new management members they did a very poor job and had unrealistic goals for one person to complete in all the departments especially in the jewelry department. Wages were unrealistic for the amount of work management required us to do and, all employees were cut hours when most employees made only minimum wage."
bad,It felt like management viewed us as replaceable cogs in a machine. Their only concern was making sure they looked good for their higher authority. Every employee there would agree on management being horrendous there.
bad,"i would like start out saying there are a lot of good people working for sears.Hmm,i guess better stop right here, I cant think of anything to say nice about sears as a company"
bad,Sears is a failing company.  They do not promote or give raises because they cannot afford to.  They do not care about their employees and over work them without caring.
bad,Not a honest company and no Union and the company is for the company not the employees or even the customers that keep them in business. Work there for 8 years as the top performer and only received 3 raises
bad,"This company needs to focus more on the employees . Lack of respect for employees . They have great potential , but unless upper management changes they will go down fast ."
bad,"good first part time good for a high school student, college student, or other"
bad,"Management asks their employees to clock out and continue working. Most cashiers are working only 4 hours a week! Management harasses their employees by threat and telling their employees to get a ridiculous amount of credit applications or get written up! Management does not help,  and every employee learns just about everything on their own. Plus they give their customers the run around after they make a sale. Glad they are filling for Bankruptcy this coming June!"
bad,"No chance for overtime, the benefits suck and are super expensive, no 401K or savings plan. The management staff knows nothing about cars. The auto divison is headed by a non mechanic as well."
bad,"Company is going under and has laid more employees that is acceptable to meet daily requirements. No training, no follow up on new hires, no one knows what is happening and lost alot of good employees."
bad,"Sears offers limited advancement opportunities. They pay minimum wage with no chances at a raise. Upper management expects salaried employees to work 50+ hours a week, while limiting the schedule for hourly employees. They then blame sale decreases on them as if they are personally responsible for advertising and pricing. They have ridiculous standards that leave employees hating their job while killing themselves to meet an unreachable bar."
bad,They are going out of buisness. I dont know why anyone would go to work for a company that will not be around in a few years. There is no saving sears they will collapse.
bad,Hardest part of the job was when the management thinking you had more than two hands wanting you to do everything. Not given realistic times on when a task should be done.
bad,This job was stressful and unsupportive. You will not have supervisor support or guidance in your experience.  I would not recommend working here until leadership is changed.
bad,"This company does not care about people. "
bad,Good experience but never has or will be the best place to work. No job security and company is fast going out of business.
bad,The only thing I learned from this job is customer service skills. The management is very demanding and like to belittle their employees. The work place culture is horrible. There is not paid time off so if you are sick or want to take a vacation it pretty much cannot happen without a significant hit to your paycheck. Full time is not full time and the pay for a lead is barely over minimum wage. It is very stressful and you will get blamed for other peoples mistakes.
bad,"A typical day here was assisting customers with their (shoe) needs, I was in the shoes department. "
bad,The manager was never around people wasnt doing they jobs like i was always long lines the people who worked there was rude to customers and i didnt like how they treated the customers i would pull them aside an tell them how to treat the customers and they really didnt care
bad,I worked for sears while in college and it caused more stress than my coursework. I worked in the warehouse and the management treated us like slaves. The workers in sales literally fought almost every day. Met a bunch of good people but the management is what drove me away from it.
bad,"Senior management has some competent and dedicated people, but the firm is controlled by someone who could care less about retail, and hopes to make money by closing stores and selling off property.  Decades of overall bad management and poor marketing have chased away numerous customers.  Days at work  - lots of work where you don't even get minimum wage, because you work without commissions for hours sometimes when the store is closed.  Sears no longer pays for mandatory training for most staff.  Management includes a wide range of people, some good, some nasty and incompetent.  Being on your feet for long hours and often no customers is painful.  Pay is not high enough any more to cover health care costs for those eligible.  Some customers are nice, as are some coworkers."
bad,"I have currently been working for sears for 5yrs.."
bad,"I don't even know where to start about what's wrong with the company. I'll summarize into a few words: overworked, underpaid, unappreciated."
bad,"A typical day at work is hectic and non stopping until time to go home.  They never gave me the opportunity to learn anything new during my 10 years. Management not the greatest.  Co-workers: some are friendly some are grumpy and unfriendly.  Hardest part is putting the go-backs away.  The most enjoyable is cleaning the floor, straightening the racks and folding the tops."
bad,While Sears stocking was my first experience in customer service. Being that I was fresh out of high school I didn't take to the job as I should have. Being irresponsible there are things I would change however this being said I still can say that Management was terrible. No one was on the same page at any stage. And coworkers were always welcoming. I did learn valuable orginization skills however this job isn't for everyone.
bad,Management changed too much. Not enough help with things. Place was dirty and nasty. Very bad people to work for. Gets rid jobs fast.
bad,Management is unskilled. No training for new employees. Merchandise is poor quality. Expectations are too high. Hard to sell the merchandise when customers keep bringing it back. Customers fly off the handle having to wait for assistance. Check outs understaffed and slow because of all the questions associates have to ask the customers before completing the transaction. Graded on metrics. Written up if metrics are low. No hours.  Stay away.
bad,"A lot to learn, manager expects you to learn everything in a week. Wasn't very informative about pay in interview. She says one thing one day and says another the next. Customer informed me she was talking about me in front of them with another associate while I was outside with a customer. If you are great at sales, then it will be good. But depends on if you can handle management. The team members are good people to work with."
bad,I only worked at Sears for 5 months and it was the most stressful 5 months of my life. They only push credit and never truly appreciate you when you do something good. It wasn't worth the pay that they gave. I'm pretty sure they use the pay to lure people in and then they just use them up and throw them out.
bad,"Struggling company with broken structure , poor management and poor job culture. No room for improvement, managers are not very professional. Only a few people stay because there is no job security."
bad,"Horrible culture.  Little actual respect for the associates.  Lots of lip service but nothing in reality.  High turnover, terrible compensation system.  For sales, salary and bonus based on performance, but the performance goals are for the most part terribly out of whack with reality.  Hourly associate variable pay NOT aligned with sales, so big disconnect."
bad,"If you are in need of a job and have basic computer skills Sears Call Center may be for you. Operate like a typical call center with very little time for breaks. Training is fun. Fast paced incoming calls in the parts department. Many customers are undecided and obnoxious. Parts customer care department you listen to irate customers due to refund and exchange policies. Many reps order wrong parts or the warehouse sends out the wrong parts for appliances, tools, lawn and garden equipment etc. It's an everyday cycle that keeps CSRs busy. If you have no personal life, spouse, kids, school this is perfect. Work-Life balance is terrible. Schedule consistently changes. Mandatory overtime is available."
bad,I quit my job because of my supervisor continuously came in on his day off and harassed everyone in the department. I got tired of his stupid routine. if any one goes to work there I would feel sorry for them. the bad thing about the whole thing the upper management team allowed him to do all that.
bad,The company as a whole has done little to keep up the quality of their stores that was at one point held in fairly high esteem.  As is fairly typical with retail jobs they pay as little as they legally can with advancement available only to those who (to be perfectly blunt and fairly crude) brown-nose management.
bad,Working at Sears is very stressful because of the unrealistic goals top management sets for their Dept.Leads throughout the store. There are no pay raises unless you're one of Store Managers favorites our Store Manager is more concerned with getting credit apps and being popular with the females in the store. The backroom associates are abused by the heavy workload and reduced hours. They are forced to complete task that other depts don't want to do they are treated with no respect they have to work in a hot warehouse with no a/c and their equipment is old and sometimes broken. They play musical chairs with managers and always promote the least qualified people and management has 0 people skills. STAY AWAY IF YOU CAN.
bad,just not the company for me. not really more that i would like to say aside from the fact that im trying to wait out the oilfield and hope it comes back soon
bad,"Stress, Stress, Stress, pay is lousy, crummy working conditions, building in need of repair.  Focus of Management is directed in ways that can only lead to failure."
bad,"Very poor Management. You are expected to work crazy hours with no respect for your family life or concerns. I have never ever heard a Manager talk so unprofessional to employees till I worked here.The pay is just a few cents above minimum wage, and for this type of work, and what they require from you, better off working at something mindless for more money. I def. do not recommend Kmart."
bad,"Sears is a major company in which I feel still has standards that need to be addressed. The staff wasn't very professional, and the manner in which they do business is minimally unethical."
bad,Do not apply for a job here....Runnnnnnn....Management needs to be improved greatly.....No room for advancement.....No pay raise....Low pay...Waste of your time
bad,I can honestly see why so many Kmarts are closing or maybe this one just gave me a bad experience. Everything is old and out dated. Don't expect any benefits or a good amount of hours because you won't receive either. Even your employee discount only takes a couple cents off whatever you buy. Literally everyone who works at that store is part time because they don't want to give anybody any benefits. The store manager is rude and doesn't help at all. Wouldn't recommend this job to anybody.
bad,"I got hired about a year ago in Fresno location.  They gave me NO training, I was just assigned to a department with no background at all.....  Their managers are so arrogant and unfriendly. At one incident, I greeted the manager with a simple 'good morning', and she,in return, rolled her eyes on me. They are just so poor with communication, and have total disrespect for the employees. I worked there for a month only, and two guys whom were hired at the same time as I did, burst into tears in one incident; because Sears is hiring uneducated trash to work for them as team leaders, people that have no regard for low tier employees nor any educational background in managing. "
bad,"I can't elaborate enough how terrible this place was to work at. I worked at the Niagara Falls, New York location for just over two months, from November 2016 until January 2016."
bad,"A warehouse job which included everything from loading and unloading courier trucks, moving appliances, inventory and customer service. Also some merchandising."
bad,"Its not the company I grew up with or your parents grew up with. Lets start out by telling you they don't care about their employees as if the pay of minimum wage without ever available for a raise doesn't rise alarms(for cashiers,office jobs,backroom) maybe you want to try commission sales at 1 percent because that's where the real money is right lol... Try a half a percent during the holidays! You sale thirty thousand dollars for a company that wants to give you a hundred and fifty dollars how can you make more than minimum wage that way either? Now here is where I have to draw the line from a management prospective high turnover rate is expected in retail but when you have a high turn overrate in management there is a company problem. If i could honestly gives this company zero stars I would.."
bad,"I loved working here because I was always given something to do, I enjoy fast paced work. But other then that just about everyday was crazy for me because for about 7 months besides me the only other manager the store had was the store manager. So 90% of the time he was in his office and 100% of the time I was on the sales floor managing our numbers and the staff. I guess it worked out since almost everything I needed to learn about my position was from reading documents and having hands on experience."
bad,"Four years working for Sears and they just kept pushing us to push more on the customer, Credit cards, E-mail Addresses, Extended Warranties can we have your Phone # so we can call you in 10 days Etc...... Sears security is not for the shop lifters but to eliminate employees, I saw more good employees being fired for no reason."
bad,A company that I would not recommend to anyone to work for in their career. they paid minimum wage to those who had been there for a number of years with no chance of advancement.
bad,"A typical work day included being told that I needed to get a certain number of people to apply for credit cards, and that if I didn't, they'd have to let me go. Management was awful, minus a select few."
bad,"Not great management, boring and very little pay, the company wasn't doing well anyways. No chance of advancement, nothing was good enough."
bad,Leadership is bad the constantly change there vision and create there own problems the company laid off like 400 plus employees and I worked there 10 years
bad,"Some people were really nice but ended up leaving because of bad management and no fairness in work distribution or pay. We were't even getting raises anymore. after the first year that i worked there. I did learn a lot about customer service and how things were run. But there wasn't ever a lot of customers especially when the prices of the  products were high and the quality low. "
bad,"Not a good place to work if you are trying to support a family, no raises, no advancement opertunities. seems management holds people back."
bad,"Set up money for check outs. Tour store for issues. Unload freight from truck. Attempt to place it on sales floor with 4-6 assoc. while running a register, customer service, layaway, and minimum 2 conference calls a day. Go thru emails for Corporate projects and also complete. Conference call on completed projects and explanation for incomplete projects. Email plan for completion. I really enjoyed the associates I worked with."
bad,it wasnt really that good to me they wasnt well put together. the managers only listened to one another. no real place to work
bad,"When I got recruited I was advised that I should stay away by another LPM but decided to go for it. I regret it to this day. I worked 8 to 17 hour days with no overtime. Management has no option but salary. I had to pull way too many overnighters due to an old alarm system that clearly needed to be replaced. Your efforts are not supported even by your district LP manager who was only concerned about making himself look good. Which includes throwing you under the bus for his mistakes. Be wary of the Laredo staff. Sherriff dept. moonlighters will get you fired just so they can be lazy and collect a check. They have no integrity, passion, or morals. Ahh Laredo's finest. There are moonlighting investigators woking there that haven't caught any shoplifters in a long while. Any numbers they have are because someone threw them a bone. Overall, every single department from receiving to management and all their audits are completely BROKEN! This chaos has been going on for over 10 years and are always on the verge of bankruptcy. 700 terminations occurred in the corporate offices in one day (2005)! Everyone is expendable and they exercise that power on a daily basis instead of fixing the problem."
bad,"sometimes employees ignore you, you seem to get the meanest of humans there is. It seems as if they are hiring a lot of people yet they no one only the managers have hours."
bad,A typical day at work consist of you standing around hoping someone comes in to shop instead of just walking through to get to the mall.
bad,"Under appreciated, and the management isn't friendly."
bad,Sears sucked. When I was employed there I was the youngest employee they had at the time and was mistreated. I never even met the manager of the store. Management stayed in seclusion from the employees. It was a weird place to work. Glad they didnt keep me!
bad,"My job at sears was to mostly get a hold of all layaway orders, keep backroom in order, unload trucks, keep the stock up from the items that sold earlier in the day, sometimes do returns. First off unloading the trucks was a joke, they just told us to lay the merchandise ""in piles"" on the floor and it got really messy. Secondly most of the customers ordered items too large for them to fit in the vehicles! Another thing was the returns, many times, the brands were covered by our company. When I told them, I can send it in, but they had to pay for it, that's when all the customers started to get agitated, and upset. Many times the cashiers would ring a tractor or some large item as ""carry out"" and they they would blame the backroom. Overall there is really nothing I can say good about this place."
bad,"Do not work here.  It is terrible.  The pay is very low and raises do not happen.  Rock bottom is exactly where the morale is, and I am not sure that ""rock bottom"" can even paint an accurate picture.  Positions and hours are cut all the time.  The worst part is that any and all good employees leave and the company is forced to put unqualified persons into management positions, which in turn makes the situation worse."
bad,Too many salespeople for the traffic. They schedule you outside of your availability.
bad,"I understand that we all have to work and if you are desperate, you take whatever you can."
bad,"I was told 3 years ago by management that I would never advance or get off minimum wage, yet others are advancing and getting raises."
bad,"i started two years ago and it was fun going to work at first. cool co workers and since i worked in the back i had a lot of down time. slowly sears started to fall apart. a new store manager came and everything went down hill. a lotttt of workers left which made my job more stressful. when your doing a supervisors job because your so short staffed w/out getting a pay raise it makes going to work feel like death trap. sears has cut so many job positions and now even closing stores. its a good temp job or summer job but i wouldnt recommend anybody to make a ""career"" out of it. theres NO advancement unless you like kissing up. and theres nothing worse than you working hard just to have a manager yell at you bc you didnt get a task done but not realizing that your department is understaffed by atleast 10 people. oh and not to mention that sears is always putting in place new technology that never ever works properly, which not only makes employees angry, but customers as well."
bad,"The manager who hired me had been with the company 14 years and was great. Once it was clear Sears was doomed, he left the company. My new manager has failed to perform his duties. Although he holds a traveling position, he has met with me only once in five months. I am left completely on my own at the store. He is never available to assist me in any way. He showed up once in our store when I was not on duty. Employees reported that he told them he was the new area manager, that he seemed lonely and just wanted to talk."
bad,"Former employee, was fired after 5 days of improper training (they didn't even have a LP manager hired on duty for my training). I made a mistake I didn't know I could make and was immediately terminated, no warning or nothing, I was treated poorly by other LP associates, and was just overall uncomfortable with the sears holdings company, they express how they enjoy team work but it was mostly just a lot of competition."
bad,"I come in and start solving member issues basically around delivery and associate error then i go over numbers and competitive shop. over all emails and execute primary tasks and attendance. provided outstanding customer service while promoting sales,upper management where very open to who they liked and didn't like and excused some behaviors while punished others. Ive learned that upper management doesn't engage or solve any issues at all they pretty much hide in their office and write people up they treat all lower management horrible.  the hardest part of my job was doing everyone's but my own. lack of appreciation for hard work and going above your job duties. the most enjoyable part of the day was the customers and the last few good people of management that where left."
bad,"Very flexible with school schedule"
bad,"God awful those are the words I will use to describe this place. If you're working here chances are you've pretty much hit rock bottom and/or have no other means of bringing in income. I've worked here for almost a year and the culture of this company is so unprofessional, so unorganized, lacking in common sense and devoid of any kind of logic. Please stay as far away as you can from this cesspool. It really doesn't matter how hard you work favoritism abounds at this place and expect to see your schedules fluctuate like crazy it all falls under the whole ""flexibility"" thing these kinds of companies have going on these days."
bad,"Sears is a massive, festering ball of contradictions. At every turn, they preach the gospel of 'Members First' yet we're told that our only objectives in the 'Customer Care' department is to sell the customer every single thing we can, despite the issues that they may be having. Now, even though we can't even send out correct parts, we are actively instructed to offer the monstrosity called 'Take The Lead' which is a 'free' home improvement consultation (a salesperson comes into your home to sell you on Sears contracted remodeling projects) which turns into a multitude of harassing phone calls if you decide not to acquiesce. We are ordered to offer this on every call in order to make money. At one point, I was told never to find the best price of a part for a customer or else we would never make money.  If you refused (just because it's a scam), you were issued a 'Plan For Personal Improvement', which is a fancy phrase for 'write up' which are never followed up on and often go unnoticed until your 'Team Manager' brings it up again when it's time for a transfer or promotion review. "
bad,"The counter manager position meant that you had to be in charge of all the employees working at your counter, making sure the counter met it's required goals, setting up visuals and displays, inventory, counter events and mainly helping with the customers!"
bad,This place is a joke. Dont care about employees. Cant have a life outside of work. One 15 minute break. For a six hour shift. I had a job where I worked six hours. Had a half hour break. Was lied to from the very first day. I started working here. Management sucked. Good thing I quit. Before They told me they were going to fire me anyway. I rather work at walmart then work here.
bad,Job was okay traveling around fixing refrigerators and meeting different people.  If you like to fix things but hate to sell things this job is not for you. It's why I left. Mangers only care about how much add on sales you can make on a service call. Also there are no raises or advancement opportunities here. Training on repairing appliances is non existent so you need to know what you are doing or figure it out as you go along. The routing office is useless they make you call the customer if there is a problem or you are running behind. You have to make at least four phone calls to four different people to order a part most of that time you are on hold for every call so a fifteen minute stop turns into an hour. Horrible experience here don't waste your time there are better jobs out there with better pay and advancement.
bad,Nothing nice to say about this job. I really despised working here.
bad,"These folks only understand how to micro manage, and hold the hands of there technicians, spent more time on the phone, and computer then fixing anything.... what a waste!!!"
bad,Management is beyond horrible favoritism is key in the Sears in Brooklyn I wouldn't recommend a friend or family even if they needed a job badly the only direction is down for this company
bad,"I worked at the Sears in Visalia, CA"
bad,"The way the company is set up creates an environment where processes and accountability do not exist, it is a free for all."
bad,"A typical day at work I am asked to do anything under the sun, including: moving freight onto the floor, putting away unwanted merchandise, changing the price on product, helping cashiers, and making sure the floor looks great all day(RAD- Ready All Day). The hardest part of my day is being told over and over what I am doing is wrong all day long, even though that's how I have been trained by my managers and leads at Sears. The communication is horrible with Sears employees, and there is no respect. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I clock off and go home."
bad,"Their management is not good. managers show favoritism. I kept getting called into the office saying my job was in jeopardy cause they want you to sign people up for reward and credit cards, and customers get mad at you for asking every time. I'm surprised Kmart is still open. I dreaded going into work everyday, They put me in layaway with heavy lifting, i cut my finger and dropped on my foot. when i called a manager to get a guy to help me, he told me to deal with it myself. I only worked there for 6 months and finally quit. I couldn't take anymore of their work ethic . Maybe it was just the Kmart in milford. idk but i will never work for them again. the schedule was back they had me work till closing at 12 then i had to be there to open up at 5am doing a 8 hour shift  during the holidays I didn't sleep for 24 hours."
bad,"Promised a lot, given nothing, incompetent people advanced before more knowledgable employees, management team changed 3 times in 4 months. Salary reduced to $4.50 an hour after (so-called) training period, commission at 12% (which was nice-BUT, with Sears' diminishing presence in the retail world and unimaginably lackluster sales support, LOW sales volume)"
bad,The day started off slow. I learned how to sell electronics. The hardest part was having to deal with management.
bad,"Not Desirable"
bad,"Sears may seem like a nice place for a job, but with upper management making things hard for there customers and employs it's a hassle. With online and In store running 2 different promotions you never know what to expect when you walk in. Also when they "" upper management "" says we don't care about stores just online, it gives a bad vibe."
bad,"You dont receive any sick days in case you get sick,yet if you miss for being sick you are written up. You can try to move to a different position or get promoted though, they either try to high you for a job you didnt apply for, or you dont move at all. The schedule you dont get to pick, its what they give you. I have kids and couldnt get off at a  decent hour. The pay is not high enough for the drama you go through in regards to escalation calls. Not to mention we are supposed to be there to help the members though have next to no empowerment given for assisting them."
bad,"Was told I was hired non-seasonal, yet 2 days after Christmas, I get the message ""yeah we just don't have enough hours to keep you, Goodbye!""  I have always been wished a great future/career if a company was downsizing and all other companies gladly provided references for future endeavors, not here.  Management is absolutely useless, Never there when needed, only there to tell you that you have to sell more extended warranties. They give away products and do not abide by same rules set forth for associates. Will not hire full time, so as to not have to pay benefits, management takes no interest in helping further your success, and does not care if you have a family to support on such poor wages, they would rather keep the kids who know nothing about the products they sell than keep a knowledgeable, seasoned Sales Associate that actually cares about customers needs. I have never given bad review to any other company I have ever worked for except Sears! That sums up Sears Holdings from my experience."
bad,"•	Provided guidance, coaching, training and motivation to over 56 Exempt and 1,150 Non-Exempt associates to maximize sales and profit. "
bad,"Cleaning up after the entire store because they don't feel it's ""their job""."
bad,Not much to say anymore. I would find anothere place to work.
bad,worked as a cashier and the registers break down every 10 minutes and the managers doesn't seem to care. Most customers say Kmart sucks and the worst retail store they've ever been to which I agree.
bad,"Terrible morale. No reason for employee loyalty, let alone customer loyalty. C-suite attrition is outrageous. My own CMO once said, ""If you are employed by Sears, you are looking for another job. I guarantee it."" That sums up the average corporate career at SHC."
bad,"just bad overall use you for long hours, no recognition for hard workers, and bad management."
bad,Sears Holdings is a trainwreck... Say away and watch this one slowly circle the drain.
bad,"The job is not difficult at all. I basically put up signs multiple times a week and reorganize shelves and appliances. The other workers and I constantly have to deal with outdated and failing equipment. Co-workers for the most part are good workers. However, most of the management lacks considerable leadership skills. All they do is care about themselves and no one under them. All they talk about is the negative, never any positive. Not even a simple good job or keep up the good work. Hardly no one receives praise unless you are a cashier who got credit applications. Anyone else, they could care less about. I can't even discuss work related matters for one minute before getting yelled at to do some work. Yet management can talk all they want back in the office about non work issues. Also, management is always says ""no cellphones,"" but yet as soon as they leave the office you can constantly spot them on their phone texting or calling someone. I highly doubt it is work related as well. There is more, but no point going on. I think I made my point. Avoid this place at all costs."
bad,"Do not work here. No raises in over 5 years hours always get cut. Management is a joke, they work you to death for no money. This place made my life miserable."
bad,"This company does not care about their emplyees, Management is rude- and the general atmosphere is poor."
bad,"Unorganized, management focus on their bonuses and not on customer or employee needs. Bad scheduling with minimal pay."
bad,They don't always care about your school schedule but there is potential to make money as a sales associate in commission. The quotas you have to meet are ridiculous and management always get on you for not meeting the numbers. Lots of punishment meetings. Hours get cut when numbers are not met. You get lots of hours when they lose people or there is holidays. You may end up with 50 hours a week and don't have time for school.
bad,"Terrible management ethics. Hostile HR department. Used illegal tactics by cutting out recorded paid work hours , denying employees' rightful and legal pay earned during clocked-in time. Made cashiers close down the register after clocking out and counting the till and accruing documents(receipts,checks,coupons)"
bad,As LP (Loss Pervention) you dont get paid enough for all you do. In the store I was in the AC worked 20% of the time....corporate knows. NO ONE really ever came into the store...very slow store. My manager couldnt prove his citizenship.  The store manager couldn't manger a toddler wiffle ball team.
bad,"I worked between 35-38 hours a week including weekends. "
bad,"Unrealistic average handle time expectations especially since they are trying to move to a ""one and done"" call scenario and the biggest influence on handle time is being forced to hold for extended periods for other departments with the expectation that you NEVER cold transfer a call."
bad,"- customer service on the floor and cashier"
bad,"It was an easy enough job, but the whole time you are pressed for time. Constantly rushed to get the job done and never really seeming to have enough time to do so. The enviroment was friendly and my co-workers were great though."
bad,This was terrible. Even Though the pay was good. Nothing more I could say. Working with Sharnitha King made me stick it out.
bad,An incredibly messed up company.  Very surprising.  Unbelievable bureaucracy and bad corporate governance.  They've outsourced their internal help-desk and HR functions and that only adds more confusion on the working level.  Can't say enough bad things.  The people on the store level are great.  Corporate should be dis-assembled!  
bad,"I worked here for 10 months and I absolutely hated it! It was the worst job I've ever had. Never had any staff and always wanted you to worked double shifts and when time for scheduling, would schedule you for like 10 days straight. When I first got called for an interview the first thing they asked was were you attending school because they didn't want to hire anyone attending school. WTH??? Management sucked and always stayed in the back. You never saw them on the floor unless it was time time to go home. Didn't properly train you to work in other departments and just threw you in them and expected you to know what to do. Co-workers would have the worst attitudes and there would be people who would get hired one day and quit the next. The place was always messy and unorganized. It was just a bad experience and I was GLAD to quit."
bad,"Management SUCKS , they are lazy and bad mouth you to other co workers , you will never get a raise , I would not recommend anyone to this store especially if you are in school everything has to do with metrics , selling credit and reward cards they ask way to many questions it's to stressful , can't keep anyone wont hire you if they don't like you , managements sits on their butts all day while the little ones deal with everything . Do not apply here , typical day is doing 4 different jobs for minimum wage and then going home crying !!! They don't like you if you work harder than them they will find a way to get rid of you ! "
bad,You would think in retail that sales would be important. However it's the other 19 metrics they expect you to hit are what is important to them. 
bad,The store does not care about its employees at all! you have to meet crazy numbers and basally lie to people to get them to open sears cards! You will get no hours at this job they will not make anyone full time
bad,"No benefits, terrible hours, it's a horrific company in general with absurd ""sales"". They believe Shop Your Way Rewards will save their dying company."
bad,"I worked as a loss prevention associate at the Frackville PA location. The job wasn't bad, but as usual it's the management that ruins the experience for most of us. I worked there while finishing my Bachelors in criminal justice, and that's all that can work there, students and elderly who are only there for spending money or have other forms of income. 8 bucks an hour? How can anyone live on that? And only part time as well?"
bad,Sears really needs to be close down they make you get credit apps no apps not hours period!
bad,"Handling cash, providing cusotmer service, and processing credit card application and different tenders for transactions."
bad,"Terrible job with Sears, they lie about the earnings please trust me on this one. Especially in the WV area, credit rejects are all over the place and you make no money on them. They make you drive your own vehicle and your drive to a ""pre-set"" appt is usually 2hrs one way. Terrible district manager, super nice on phone, and in person. But like a true sales man they are, they promise the world and deliver nothing. Wouldn't waste your time with them."
bad,Environnement de travail déprimant à moins d'être en formation pour devenir policier (ière) ou réserviste dans l'armée.
bad,"The store I am at promotes and advances predominantly Hispanic leads and managers, whether they are qualified to lead or not. I have worked many other places before coming to Sears (I am a retiree working at Sears), and it is appalling the kind of people they put in positions of trust and ""so-called"" management. One young woman was only there a few weeks, got promoted, but on two occasions she had to ask me how the spell two, basic English words. She happened to be the cousin of one of the softline managers, who was promoted, but suddenly quit."
bad,the manager there was bad. he had a thing for one of the employee. i found out. that manager don't ever do his job.
bad,I was brought in as a contractor and was treated like a 2nd class citizen. There were no benefits and the pay was below average. The work was meaningless. There was no direction from management and I performed work that was just plain stupid.
bad,Possibly the worst job that I have ever had.
bad,"This is a horriable place to work. There is no work life balance, it's real time slavery. The DDM is clueless!"
bad,I am a former employee of 5 years. Only worked in Electronics as a sales consultant working for a base pay of $6/hr plus commission (that kept decreasing in percentage as time went on)
bad,"If your an individual who enjoys working long hours for a low salary rate and no appreciation for your efforts. And enjoy being worn down for company driven metrics , that has absolutely nothing to do with Sales or Customer service . If you enjoy watching incompetent individuals being promoted for who they know rather than what they know . Then Sears Is The Place For You ."
bad,Its a horrible place to work. They treat you as if your expendable. They do not value any of there employees. Super over worked and underplayed. I basically do a 4 person job everyday for 7.25. Ive been there 5 years and still make the same as a new hire.
bad,"Sears is not about quality, it's only about sales. No work in the winter, wanted too overwork you in the summer. No work in the middle of the week, but they wanted you to work every Saturday! And if you didn't sell the numbers they wanted your fired."
bad,Sears really sucks. Worked for almost 12 years without a promotion and the last 3 years without a raise.I learned not to trust what they say.
bad,cashier
bad,Very limited hours and management does not back up its employees
bad,"Sears is a very slow, very empty store most of the time. There are periods of rushing customers through (due to the management letting so many cashiers go and never putting more than one at any register unless it's the Holiday season), and employees are not trained AT ALL on any products or offers we have. Employees are expected to do their own personal research, which is normally not a bad thing, except they expect us to do so regarding the multitude of tools, electronics, and appliances we sell, meaning we likely have no idea what we even sell, leading to a poor customer experience."
bad,"they do not pay their employees well, no room for advancement, and no support from the managers."
bad,"The two managers there would tell you anything to hire you, then tell you anything to explain why you weren't being compensated properly. They are currently reaping what they have sown. Round the bowl, down the hole, roll sears roll....."
bad,There was extremely poor management and no job training. There was lack of organization of information and a lack of help.
bad,"I quickly became one of the head guys in my department and even though there were many hard times/goals, I accomplished them. The only good thing about this job was that it gave me the work ethic to ignore all the negatives and keep my eye on the problems at hand and to accomplish them to my full ability."
bad,The company has underrgone some changes. Do to finincial reasons I am seeking employement
bad,"My job was very hard work, sometimes doing the same amount of work you would do in eight hours, delegated to four hours. The management was rude and disrespectful and treated some people favourable and others in a hurtful manner."
bad,"Manager was more into socializing than training, didnt feel like i had the tools i needed. I was under staffed and had regular questions but my manager was no where to be found."
bad,"Terrible company to work for, managers never seem to know what they're are doing and on top of that communication between management and lower level employees is very weak. Personal recommendation go to school or pick up a trade."
bad,o Very challenging environment for career development
bad,"Mediocre employees, fancy titles for senior management (to attract & retain younger talent), no work life balance (there maybe for junior employees), no accountability amongst employees, no performance review, company is a sinking ship, salaries are worst among retailers, brutal cut throat executives which filters down the hierarchy, high turnover"
bad,not a good place to advance and build a career. the division i worked in was terrible and management lacked skill
bad,"this company cares nothing of anything but the bottom line. they are unorganized, and micro mangages everything that you do. every second, and i mean every second, you are on the clock is accounted for. if you clock in a minute early from lunch you have to sign a piece of paper stating why. if you go to the bathroom for more than 2 minutes, it counts against.everyting you do is a caculation. the managment staff is incompetent. you can ask 6 mangers in the same department the same question, and you will get 6 different answers. we were selling thousands of dollars worth of elect and appliances but did not recieve 1 bit of training for it. we just would guess as we went along. the managers never knew the answer. the calls are back to back. you dont even have a second to breath. in fact if you dont wrap up the call with in 10 seconds it counts against you. i was making like 20,000 in sales but did not recieve 1 penny of commission even though the associates in the store did. they would encourage us still sales from store. they would encourage us to lie when we didnt know the answer. there have been times where i was selling something and had know idea what i was taking about, but as long as i got the sale. if you were smart and wanted to move up, they would use you by giving you more responsibility but wouldnt actually promote you.the would have piles and piles of papers on every second of every momment you were in that god forsaking place. everyone there was so depressed.just thinking about the year i worked there... if i had more time to tell you the horror stories of that place"
bad,"Haters and jealous  people at this company. Apply at your own risk. "
bad,"El entrevistador de Rh te pinta la empresa como la mejor en el ramo, tanto en sus ofertas de trabajo como en persona, y te miente porque no tienen sueldo base sólo comisiones y los que tienen sueldo base ni siquiera es el salario mínimo completo."
bad,"The management here was actually pretty nice and understanding to certain degrees, they let me do my art in peace. You could read books and all of the calls where sort of inbound but also outbound. I would call out but it was based on them wanting to be called. Most of the time, it wasn't great but it was okay. I guess?"
bad,"Worst company I’ve EVER worked for.  Ever.  You’re just a number and have no value to them at all.  They’ll pay you poverty wages, and set goals for commissions impossible to meet (and I was a top biller in the company for my department)..."
bad,"No moral support, no team bldg ,  Lead Mentor is a back stabber & runs to the DM every chance he gets to talk bad or to lie about another team member just for his gain. The Co is in financial trouble. No raise in 3 years. Also was promised full time 40 hours a week but in the last 3 years not the case, hours are inconsistent. Every employee there talk bad about the mentor and DM"
bad,"While only at Sears for 3 years, the store had 5 different store managers. Was not a stable work environment. There  were way to many changes. Nothing stable. But most of the workers were hard worker and professional."
bad,"Never got commissions paid out correctly. Managers were constantly negative & often absent for long periods at a time. When I went into labor with my son my mom, my only coach, was fired for leaving to be with me when they knew in advance she was my coach & they had people to cover. Overall horrible to work for because they’re all money hungry!"
bad,"I worked at Sears for a year, and it was a bad time. The employees (save for a couple) were all out for themselves, including the management. Management didn't care about the store, and it reflected. The store was always empty, unless someone wondered in lost, but they quickly realized they were in Sears and would be in an all out run trying to exit, also trying to avoid the stupid jock salesman desperate for a sale. I doubt this review contrast from other Sears stores."
bad,many of the people working here at been there a very long time if you're good and aggressive then you got to go away I was treated like a redheaded stepchild the whole time I work there because I picked on it picked up everything they wanted to teach me right away and able to execute repairs that other guys took years to master as a result
bad,They will try and make you do other employees jobs when you didn’t get hired to do someone else’s job and it’s not even on your job tittle for what they want you to do
bad,"Management was not good. They did not back up their employees, and often made us look bad in front of customers."
bad,"Sears will overwork you, make false promises and play ignorance to the schedules they set for you. This was a very unstable position to be in, as not only do you have to deal with customers, but bad managers as well. I have been guilt tripped AND threatened to be written up due to taking late lunches-even though each time I was never scheduled the hours to take a lunch OR I was never relieved for a lunch. Despite all the hard work I put in, going above expectations, the company took advantage of that and refused to let me achieve anything higher than a cashier."
bad,Leadership has one goal and that is to keep funding themselves until the end.  I loved working for Sears up until three years ago when one could see what leadership was doing to the company.  It's a sad state affair.
bad,You’re expected to work in your department and also deal with other departments. They definitely do not pay enough for the amount of work. Management is highly unprofessional.
bad,"Horrible management.  Only there 6 mo., first 2 Dm's were great, 3rd was a corporate clown from Houston.  He saw my store which was vastly improved from being a total shole as a shole still.   Despite having made money the first time all year in Sept. he fired me in Oct..  Next day, Sears Canada made their announcement and so the dominos went, well deserved......."
bad,Benefits are terrible. Very Corporate culture. Call in procedures have to be followed or it counts against you. If there was a car wreak in front of you and you had to save someone's life and it made you late. They dont care. They can't. Its policy. Now Sears is owned by Transform Co. Same company but different name. Executive's
bad,"Not the place for advancement, too many individuals in positions that don’t have knowledge. No clear direction on objectives , or ways to meet company mission, it doesn’t surprise me that the company is tanking ."
bad,This was a fun job at first. New manager made it a living nightmare. I would not recommend this place to anyone interested in working there. The new manager cut my pay from 10.00 hr to 9.00 hr as soon as he took over.
bad,"One of the most poorly ran companies I've worked for.  The insist that you follow their plan, when clearly, that is leading to bankruptcy.  When I took over the location, it was the worst in the district.  They kept saying that tire sales are the most important thing.  My customer count was down 50%, my techs were miserable and making no money, etc.  Within one year, I made that store the 3rd most profitable store in the district.  And w"
bad,"The job itself is easy what makes it unbearable is management and support. You cant order half the products on the floor, and what u can order usually doesn't get to the customer at promised delivery time. over half of the orders placed have some kind of issue such as not delivered on time, delayed, delayed again, scratched, dented, etc. Management takes no responsibility and your check can be cut in more than half in one single day because of reoccurring problem that no one can solve. save yourself the headache and get ANY other job. Management changes every 2 years, the only good thing is the people you work with and the supervisors. The company is dying slowly and there is no room to further your career, it's very sad to watch."
bad,No volvería a trabajar en esa empresa por los k integran esa empresa
bad,District and Regional support lacking Store Management Stressed from verbal abuse during conference calls. Lack of hours given to stores. Lack of support.
bad,"I worked at Sears for 3.5 years as an appliance sales person. Straight commission unless you didn't sell what you would have made at minimum wage. Then they would pay you a draw salary. However, once you made over that draw amount you would be deducted until it was paid back. I only went into draw once during my time there, but the not knowing what your pay was from paycheck to paycheck was very stressful. Then they started cutting so many of the other perks that I went and applied at Lowe's where I got a base salary plus commission. Best decision ever."
bad,"Clocked in, took a ticket, retrieved car/truck, completed work, parked, retrieved another ticket and car/truck, completed work, and so on and so on and so on until end of day. many many new managers during my time there. many many new techs, all levels but master tech. Mostly good guys, some good, some bad. same with managers. hardest part of job was the pay. not nearly enough for layers of work involved. the best part of the job was the ability to pause when work slowed and take a breath."
bad,"Terrible place to work, management is a joke!!! Paid one manager a salary to set in her office and make bulletin boards, only time she’d get up is to use the bathroom and she’d go thru the warehouse just so She didn’t have to deal with customers. No pay raises in almost 10 years.."
bad,Didnt care about in-store associates cut there own sales team to make online better not competitive with competitors unrealistic sales goals this is why they went out of business
bad,"There was not any motivation for growth. The only reason why I became a supervisor was because, the previous supervisor became ill in the hospital and the store was closing."
bad,Constant work for dirt wages.  Management from other areas of the store will require you to do their work while yours is stranded.  Then you get in trouble for not completing your job
bad,"The store was always slow, had to wait for customers. Wasn't much to do but stand around a fold clothes for hours, hurting your back in the process from standing and not much movement. Management showed favoritism to those who got the most credit cards and talked to others rudely. The most enjoyable part about the job was clocking out and being able to clean fitting rooms in solitude."
bad,Jewelry Dept was ok helping customers looking at the jewelry and selling quite a lot of it.  Was good selling jewelry. Customer Service was fun there.
bad,Managed by a team of incompetent buffoons. It has an unpleasant atmosphere and is governed unfairly. Nothing gets done because the managers don't know how to do anything.
bad,"If you want to work for a company thats all me, me, me-then this is the place for you. Sears cares more about credit card applications and saving money rather than treating its employees fairly and having decent hours of operation"
bad,"I worked for this company for a year, and in this time I was given more bologna than Oscar Mayer. In my interview  I was told the amount of commission you are given, by the owner, was 10% of total sales made. After noticing my first paycheck did not reflect this, I talked to the owner, and was told that commission was actually 10% of what the store makes, or ~1%. Scheduling was weighted in the favor of whoever the owner liked the best that week, and the job itself was never fully explained, yet all of the work done at the store was expected to be done correctly to the owner's standards, of which none of us knew."
bad,"Worked the New Orleans, Louisiana location as a Home Services Appliance Technician, under a tyrant, constantly butted heads because she did not have people skills whatsoever, when put in her place she would use the excuse she don’t mean any harm."
bad,"Turnover of employees was frequent, managers never seemed to know what they were doing, I was hired to work in the garden center but was made to work as a cashier, etc."
bad,Manager are constantly harassing you and I’m not over exaggerating. If you plan on making this your first retail job DO NOT. Worst place managers are constantly bugging you about credit even when they’re aren’t any customers. Also always bugging you about shop your way. Its just not a good environment they expect you to do more than what your paid. Pay is awful for them to make you wipe down tables like a custodian.
bad,In my role I leaned a lot of the automotive industry and retail. In the beginning the days were very busy and productive. The hardest part of the job was no room to advance do to the company going into bankruptcy. The best part was helping my employees grow in their productivity and having very satisfied customers.
bad,"It was too slow paced and no affordable benefits ,raises Or bonuses. No opportunity given for advancement when it was clearly proven by metrics consistently through the years."
bad,"work culture was low"
bad,Honestly....I would only suggest working here if you can't find any other type of work. The only enjoyable part about this place are the co workers( which you hardly see) and the customers you interact with( even though most are upset)... If your looking for a sales job then this is the place to be....they don't care about you actually fixing anything. Management is constantly micro managing your sales. The work load is unbelievably large..your expected to fix these machines in 30 minutes or less...that includes driving to pick up Parts once you've figured out the problem.....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR SANITY.
bad,"Hard work for little pay, acknowledgment or advances.  Was not a fun place to work.  My manager made it quite pleasant.  She was well aware of the problems with Sears management and wanted to help as much as she could."
bad,Hours weren’t as promised when hired. Wasn’t cross trained as indicated when hired. Company filed bankruptcy so I don’t feel secure with the direction the company is going
bad,"extenuante el trabajo,ambiente laboral malo,no lo recomiendo,no tienes vida social"
bad,"You are never really rewarded for hard work. A lot of times I felt manipulated by a manager to quit. No one else in management cared. They would make your schedule, then change it without your knowledge or even notifying you, then you would get in trouble at no fault of your own."
bad,"Very tough environment to grow within. Not easy to get the support you need to be successful at your job. Too much turnover. As soon as you get comfortable and feel like you are making progress, your leader gets released to the industry or resigns from the pressure."
bad,"I was in the employ of Sears during the riots of Rodney King.  The very next day afterwards, I got a call from a co-worker not even a Supervisor.  I was asked ""if I saw what occurred on TV, and that the store was looted"".  I replied yes, and then I was told ""I no longer have a job"", and no longer employed"".  By this time I was already in the employ of Sears for two yrs.  "
bad,"I don't like it period , idk why indeed is making us do this , iam currently still working there with no hours & the managers are unprofessional & stuck up"
bad,"Always under staffed, odd hours, unkind staff and management. Unsatisfied costumers, unorganized store and very low pay for the amount of stress in the environment"
bad,Sears was not a great fit for me because the lack of advancement and not enough compensation for the amount of responsibilities you are required to do. Additionally there were not enough  employees In the loss prevention department which is where I worked.
bad,"Two years of regret. Sears based its scheduling on ability to sell Maintenance Agreements (MA's), basically extended warranties. Product knowledge and customer service was a distant second to the ability to schmooze customers into buying MA's. Scheduling was based on those sales and Associates with low MA totals were often given one four hour shift in the early part of the week as punishment for low MA sales."
bad,"sears is dead.  get out now.  worked in whittier,ca.  its on a path to close,.  terrible sales.  management is on your butt for lack of sales.  it might be close by now"
bad,It was inspiring in the beginning but over the years grew to be more and more about profit and less and less about the customer we served. Culture is a joke.
bad,Incompetent management defined sears. The store was always understaffed and many cash registers were regularly left unattended. The pay was good until they cut commission by half resulting in halving pay to those working on commission.
bad,You will never ever receive a raise at Sears. Part time employees start at minimum wage and stay there. Working hours get reduced every few months too. There were sneaky managers who were very dishonest with the associates but they have left now. The corporate office doesn't know or care what goes on at the store level. Many associates reported unethical and unlawful behavior to the corporate office but the corporate office protects these managers and just moves them to another Sears location.
bad,"It is a minimum wage job (told I’d be paid more from the start, never was even after being repromised multiple times by management). Management is constantly on you about rewards and credit, which makes it stressful and miserable for the employees. Never consistent work schedule."
bad,"What's there to say? Sears is going the way of the dinosaur. Cannibalization is rampant throughout the company. They are not paying anyone with talent to stay, so you are left with unmotivated, and unfit individuals at all levels of operations."
bad,"Sears will be closed for good by 2020. Absolutely stay away from Sears. They will be closing very soon. If you want a retail job, look somewhere else."
bad,I use to enjoy sears but now constant complaint on sells. They drive you long miles and care less if you are home with family. Sears is on life support DONT apply for employment very bad company to work for
bad,no me gusto nada en general ni el salario  ni la gente ni las prestaciones ni los horarios nada es mediocridad la que te hacen sentir al trabajar ahi es mejor liverpool en todos los aspectos
bad,Very unorganized and very poor management. The pay is horrible and the job is stressful. The company needs major help in management and sales. The staff is rude and everyone quits. The products are usually have complications.
bad,There is a steady stream of super talented workers that join the company and then leaving once they recognize there is no hope of a transformation.  People are smart and friendly but learn very quickly why the company is failing.
bad,It is Sears goal to hire people and then fire them they do not care about their people and they do retaliate so beware if you complain about working a 13-hour day with no meal break or bathroom break you will be written up and give a 60-day notice where they double and triple your sales goals unrealistically so that you have no option but to fail
bad,"Sears is not a place that I would recommend to any one. Terrible pay, terrible benefits, management is not very helpful due to the company letting help go and spreading management so thin."
bad,"Under paid and over worked.  They don't give out raises and expect more out of you as people are let go due to downsizing and lack of budget.  Also, the benefits are horrible."
bad,Sears was great to work for 40 years ago. I don't think that there is 2 still in business within 50 miles of my house. I wouldn't recommend working at sears at all.
bad,"Over the 3 years I worked for them I saw my store and several others fall apart internally. During that time we had 6 different store mangers. I was paid commission only  where over the last year they dropped commission rates so low that I could barley make minimum wage. For example when I was hired I could make $400-$500 off an $10,000 sale and during my last year i would be lucky to make $150."
bad,"commission job, if you did not make enough to match current minimum wage they paid you at least what you would make on minimum wage and you had to pay the company back the difference"
bad,As a tv repair tech you ride with a tech for 2 weeks then turned loose on your own. Never felt fully prepared so many different tvs. There were just enough rude customers to ruin your day. If u have thick skin it will come in handy. I do not
bad,There was no communication from management. Schedules were given last minute and time off was near impossible to get. Sears had no respect for my time as they expected me to NEVER make any other plans as if I was always on call. The pay is miserable if you don't make comission. I made minimum  wage and I was told I'd make $10/hr at the interview. The computer system is outdated which makes finding your schedule more challenging.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this place. This company will constantly ask you to go out of your way and do things that are not in your job description. In fact, I was repeatedly asked to do things that I had been expressly forbidden from doing. "
bad,"I did not like working at sears! They pay you very little, but expect you to go well beyond the position you applied for and to take the job seriously. Upper management is only worried about themselves, and do not like to help when you have questions, floor work, etc. I would not recommend to others unless you are in high school trying to make a few extra dollars because you can't pay no bills working here."
bad,"Pay raises obsolete, we were told had to sale protection agreements to earn more but commission from sales were 3%. Customers upset over cost of repairs making any upsales next to impossible"
bad,"They never give raises,but your call requirements are littered with upsells of products.  Managers won't take escalated calls, they tell you excuses to give to cstr. Majority of calls are complaints about service but your supposed to upsell. They don't care if people gossip or argue and the managers talk about the reps, even some managers gossip with reps. It's the worst company I've ever worked for and I've been doing call center jobs for 35 years. Don't do it.  My training class had 25 people but most left after we got out of training and seeing how poorly ran it was and learning they don't give raises there. I toughed it out 2 years and was the only one left from my training class for over a year. They were smart. Don't believe me? Look at reports on Sears. Customers don't trust them and complain about everything."
bad,i worked there for 2 years never got a raise was promised department lead... worked all the shifts didnt pay very well. played favorites poor management
bad,"When I worked at Sears I was in Highschool. They would schedule me during school hours.  A Co-worker was covering my shift and broke her leg on the way there, they gave me a write up for a no call no show."
bad,"Management is usually not so cooperative. They treat their associates like trash cans. They don't wanna sell products, all they want is credit credit credit and syw, syw syw. Extremely disrespectful to customers."
bad,"Stepping stone to better. not a place to make a career. company provides no avenues for success, as does not provide appropriate training for positions."
bad,"This company has been in decline, they have been letting go of people left and right to hire part timers to save money. no pay raises ,bad management and in the fulfillment center they have you working multiple areas because other departments are understaffed. Managers are not there to help you they just sit around. You will be underpaid."
bad,"What can I say, the store was run terribly by upper management."
bad,"They'll start you at full time and as time passes by , they'll start dropping your hours to 20 hours or less. They come up with so much excuses to take advantage of you , no employee discounts no benefits and when it comes to promotion they don't give raises in pay. They just add 8 to 10 hours to your schedule with more responsibilities as a supervisor or manager."
bad,The management was horrible. The management was unorganized and didnt have respect for their employees nor their management team. Very toxic environment filled with old angry people.
bad,"after working as a part timer altho expected to work full time hours with no benefits for 2 years ... an older retiree from head office joined Home Theater Sales team + subsequently ensured my hours + shifts diminished / stopped because he perceived my engaging personality as a threat ... "
bad,I have been with sears for just over a year. I would not let my dog work here if I had to. The work place started out great and as time went on management changed and then now the whole store is changing. If I could changed the way the store was ran I would stay.
bad,"At my store all our managers do nothing all shift but talk and remind you how you're doing something wrong. Usually it's just constant hovering over all the associates waiting for something to go wrong. I rarely ever see my managers get anything done. Horrible pay, horrible for any type of promotion or advancements. Avoid at all cost."
bad,"There is no room for growth within the company. It is always questioned on if the company is going to close. Rarely received pay increases, never recognized by management."
bad,"They require you to lie to customers to meet your daily percentages.  If you don't, you will be replaced.  If you decide to take a chance with them then expect your location to close down without any notice.  Very crooked company.  Avoid them to work for or have your vehicle worked on there."
bad,It was ok. But no one took leadership and the one person in charge was never really there. Would lie to us about what was going on. Had contractors and customers yell at us for refunds Then they went under and closed up shop
bad,Retailer is struggling.  The first cuts are staff and hours creating more work for already overburdened staff.  Little resources or training.  
bad,"Dying company, you can see the vultures circling to scavenge for any remaining scraps after the last drop of fight has gone.  See store closure list. . ."
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever worked. management was constantly at each others throats and because of this treated employees like garbage. DO NOT WORK HERE.
bad,"Management has no demonstrated interest in running a retail business. Outsourcing / off shoring of every position possible breeds paranoia among employees. Horrible environment to work in. "
bad,"Too much stress not enough money. sups would take escalation calls. And seemed the reps jylust started transferring customers to any line just to get them off their line.. "
bad,"I didn't have much trouble working at sears. I got to my job, clocked in and then I went to find out at station I would be working at. Everyone at sears were helpful and nice."
bad,Manager was a backstabber. Promise one thing and does the opposite. Some employees always talking bad about other employees. Never give raises unless you get promoted.
bad,Jornada de 10 hrs diarias que por ley son 8 pasadas la la 9 hora se paga doble y la decima triple si conoces la ley federal del trabajo sabras que es una basura de trabajo comision del 1 por cierto eso sin mencionar la vemta nocturna que es una basura si no te quieres superar en la vida quedate en esta basura de empresa con sus salarios de hambre
bad,"No chance to advance, No raises, management has got to be world record the worse ever but district manager and above wont do anything about these issue...oh plus the store is closing in a few months so its not even worth it. McDonald's employees get treated better than us"
bad,Certain people worked well with others. Management was always changing. Not everyone was treated fairly. Cashiers are pushed to get credit. Not everyone is happy that works there. Some people get their way and others do not.
bad,Worked hard for this company for over two decades - pay low and closed with no severance. The morale was low however some great co-workers who were long standing employees.
bad,"Its was horrible job, management was okay, the hours horrible, forced to make commission, it was terrible  as a sale associate you have to know knowledge of the product and sell the insurance with it."
bad,Working at the location I last worked at the manager I worked under over promised and under delivered about hours and wages. When confronted about it i was told i hadn't earned it because i wasn't leading my team (i was not in a leadership position) even when i pointed out when i tried to take the lead and accomplish a goal i was met with resistance and complaints.
bad,"Worked at Sears for 14 years every year the pay goes down I work on commission only and the percentage keeps going down, and they want more work with no pay ! The benefits were good at one time a long time ago. The price for medical insurance went up so much I have to look elsewhere for a lower price.they have so many sales people on the floor no one can make money."
bad,"Management out of touch, managers not on the same page with each other, poor rapport with CSR agents, faulty and cheap products being serviced by the repairs department, and staff underpaid for the belligerence of the customers."
bad,"Working here will pay for your gas , but I do not recommend working here unless you are a student in High school. Management is very poor and unorganized , customer satisfaction was pushed but never actually taken seriously. Managers and supervisors solemnly cared about monetary income and gave little attention to hours given to employees , You would only get called in when they desperately needed assistance. You never felt like a valuable asset to the company."
bad,"This place actually offered me $7.25 as if this was reasonable. I have a managerial background along with pricing, merchandising, and inventory. The guy that interviewed me was making plans for me to be a cashier, merchandise, along with sale in his department also for $7.25. Smh. Oh yeah, also wanted me to be a lead for this small amount of pay. No one can actually pay a single bill with this. How can someone make off of this. I will never work for this company. This company over works its employees for a little bit of change. Never again!"
bad,"Lead are rehashed and prospect offered more off. I resented giving up 3 hrs drive time each way, and another 3 hour presentation, only to be undersold."
bad,Supervisors are super unprofessional including associates and managers. Unfair on the hours and favoritism like crazy I would not recommend this job endless it is a temporary job.
bad,The company as a whole is a sinking ship and in order to try to cut cost the company will regularly find ways to cut your pay and assign more duties to you.
bad,"Upper management takes accusing tones, doesn't ask first.  Uses any small misstep as reasons to let people go. Upper management blames lower management for leadership issues, but shows no leadership themselves."
bad,"1- under valued and paid"
bad,"Wouldn't recommend any job with this company.  Sears doesn't care about their employees. There is no Work/Life balance. Benefits are good, but not worth going to work with them."
bad,"Starting from the very top and working it's way down there is no strong leadership or management in place. Every one is out to make themselves look better, no matter who they have to walk over. Unless you want to be constantly stressed and receive nothing but negative commentary, avoid this company."
bad,Bad management. Failing Company. Little to no hours. No overtime. Not much concern for employee's safety. No raises ever given unless moved up in management. Nepotism.
bad,My team had increased workload as the overall staffing reductions continued. The fast paced environment often sacrificed quality for speed. My team functioned very well considering the outside factors that often played large roles in our day to day operations.
bad,If you are new you really don't get hours and the hourly pay is VERY low.  I learned that if you are not there to correct your sales order other team members will take your commission.
bad,"Its a good starting point specially for young adults getting into the work force. Teaches customer service and respect for retail workers. But its stressful, and depending on your crew can be very high school"
bad,"Slow, run down computer systems that crash during checkout services. Mistreatment of employees in front of customers. Cuts hours all the time without notifying, and changes schedule without notifying."
bad,"Management is terrible. No pay raises. Hours are always being cut. More work and less money. Terrible working conditions. Store is always hot, gnats in breakroom and on sales floor, always cutting hours, not enough help or coverage."
bad,i had a really terrible boss and management does not care about you the pay is terrible and the overall vibe was despressing. sears is a sinking ship get off while you still can.
bad,"Unfortunately the management at my store was lacking severely. they couldn't keep good managers because they were required to do too much for too little pay so they often left after only a few months. Too many inconsistencies between departments and no good established management plans."
bad,Its a job for a recent tech school grad wanting to get some experience.After you have worked there for a while it turns into a dead end job.They don't give any raises or advancement.The companys retail business is suffering.
bad,"The compensation was horrible. Even after working for them for 4 years, as a manager, I was only making $11.50/hour. I had a bachelors degree and still was making pennies! The company doesn't care about the employees."
bad,"It was a nice environment "
bad,The entire culture is disregards the individual and blames the associate if anything goes wrong no matter that you did your job to the best of your ability. It becomes stifling fast.
bad,"No coherent strategy for the long-term viability of the business.  Good people within Sears working diligently, however, the there is severe risk of losing one's job on any given day."
bad,"Sears is all about looks. If you look ""stylish"" and are ""skinny"" then you're easily hired. They don't seem to care about your skills nor customer service. You will be judged based on your fashion choices and body image. If a manager thinks you don't look the part, they'll move you to shipping or terminate you. Management is mean and not very knowledgeable. The customers are rude. You're expected to dress as if you were modeling in a fashion show, yet they work you like a dog (moving racks, lifting, cleaning, etc.)"
bad,"never saw a pay increase in 3 years. some managers ok, others terrible. little to no job advancement and inflexible scheduling. work far exceeds the pay"
bad,"bloated management, outdated practices, old school technology and ways of thinking. You arent a tech, you are a salesman. All they care about it ' sales sales sales'"
bad,"This is one of the most ill ran companies I have ever seen. Poor management/constant bickering btwn them and the way they treated employees, disgraceful.  They could not keep help due do their lack of leadership.  Broke many laws regarding Human Resources, confidentiality, and laws regarding breast feeding mothers pumping at work. I was given a constant run around and put into a room with Cameras w/out my knowledge. I do not reccomend this company."
bad,I needed someone to work around my college class work load and that is about all they did.  The store had not customers so I could study in the meant time which was great.
bad,They purposely find reasons to let people go because they hire in bulk and do not really need those persons. Which is really unfortunate for them because I knew better before I started because my wife left because they where mean and unstable
bad,A typical day is handling issues with member accounts. I have learned that you have to be vocal about what you expect of the employer and be ready to have conversations with several people for a small matter to be resolved. There is no accountability for advisors to follow standards as simple as dress code policies. Management is generally motivational and keep moral up but also have little control over scheduling or being forgiving with personal conflicts that require time off of work and offer no raises and you are told to find a new job if you would like to earn more no matter how good of a worker you may be. The hardest part was keeping myself motivated when others were able to be unproductive and do the same job poorly with no punishment. There is no reward for doing a job exceptionally and no punishment for poor work so there is no motivation to do a good job when a bad job is treated the same. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to have my own workspace in a cubical and be able to organize myself separately of coworkers which helps me stay focused.
bad,With all the news in the media it is unfortunate to say I can see why they are losing business. The company cares very little for their employees and that shows in how the employees handle the customers. Very poorly.
bad,Management is rude and doesn't give proper breaks. They will cut your hours and not give you a heads up. They will promise you a certain amount of hours and then after your first couple of months is up your hours will be cut.
bad,"It is hard to believe this company is still in business because it is no longer a relevant company. They are trying to change the way the business is running however, it is too little to late."
bad,Sears required their associates to do more work than what the job called for. hey rarely showed any of their associates appreciation. And would ask for associates to do work that's not within the means if the job description
bad,A group of well meaning employees trying their best to overcome a tsunami of bad press. Entitled customers who believe that we need to honor non existent warranties or abide by policies that no other retailer would ever agree to. A CEO who wants to bring the company in to the 21st century but a board unwilling to spend the capital to do so.
bad,I worked for the company for almost 8 years and never once was given a raise . I didn't qualify for benefits. I was treated poorly. my co-workers were fantastic but the management is not.The company is losing a lot of their regular customers due to the change the store is going through.
bad,Worked customer service over  at  Sears Parts Direct  in Hicksville.  Manager has serious OCD and is very short tempered. Horrible working environment
bad,"Clearly a failing company, forcing managers to cut costs wherever possible."
bad,"If you want to be a salesman this is the job for you if you want to be a tech find a serious company to work for.  You get no raises, and the management are yes men basically androids. You can ask 3 different people the same question and get three different answers. They are a joke and there is a reason sears is dieing."
bad,"Management is horrible, the pay is awful, benefits are so bad it's not worth your money, they pile more and more work on you without giving you anything in return, they only seem to hire people that lie, steal, do nothing besides cause trouble, and hardly ever show up, yet still somehow have a job. I even heard that people were sleeping together for favors and positions within the company.You don't wanna work there even if it was the only place offering a job."
bad,"Helping customers meet their product needs. Culture is diverse."
bad,Management only concerned about applications for credit cards; punished rather than coached if quota not met.  Management has no concerrns for their employees or their safety
bad,have preloaded work route.possibly 10-12 service calls a day. Routingdepartment overloads work:un-orghanized>cannot reach a Manager for urgent matter.have extensive jobs with very little time giving.learned electrical. mechanical in most appliances.
bad,"The work atmosphere would be considered chaotic at best. No associates (Due reduced hours, confidence in job security,closings and mainly pay) and reduced Management. The CEO has transformed the company into general store like environment with very little product on hand (with the climate of take it home to day mentality) It feels like a old Service Merchandise, Big Wheel or Sun TV."
bad,"it's a great place to work if you don't have a family and if you only like to work"
bad,"bad place to be, going out of business, do not care about the business or employees, no sense of need to continue, no help for marketing, sales are falling off the edge daily"
bad,"There is no formal training to speak of, for the hourly/ management positions. If you want to learn something you need to reach out, usually to associates below you, and hope they have time to stop what they are doing to advise, and usually it's to read a tutorial, and figure it out. Very disappointed for such a large company"
bad,A dying company that's making last ditche efforts to save itself by trampling all their associates. There are barely any hours anymore. Management team is a laugh who were promoted simple because they are there.
bad,"I enjoy the job and the people I work with. However, Sears Holdings has been in a downward spiral for the past 5 years and despite their transformation efforts, their store performance and same stores sales continue to decline."
bad,The management was a JOKE!! Do not work here for your own sanity!! All they cared about was themselves and their bonuses and they never had enough equipment for all of the staff.
bad,Ita a trip. ..they hire like 10 classes training its only 13.50 no commission untill you opp out..then its 11. Plus commission. They hire and fire.good money if you can sell.other then that this company is going under sears is old and can't compete with lowes.managers are lazy.call out sick most likely getting fired.hr lady is rude. You dont even have a set schedule and a desk.computers are shared like kids in a library.
bad,"Sears Holdings is a good place to start a career or used as a work gap fill, but, its not a place to work long term nor is it an environment of mentoring."
bad,"UNSTABLE COMPANY.. "
bad,"Poor leadership and management really turned the work environment sour and lead to low moral, low pay, horrible benefits.  I would not advise anyone to work at Sears."
bad,This was my first job and the employees and managers are so rude I would never work for sears again. the leads at this sears are rude and ecpect you to work everything as fast as possible when it comes to being a sales associate.
bad,"The staff changed on a daily bases. I was in the office at the end of my time there, I was the only one there in the office and put a lot of stress on me. It went to three office workers down to just me."
bad,"was micromanaged which at my age and my work ethics was very uncalled for"
bad,I am not sure if all the stores are the same but the manager at the store I was at was not nice and she was just all about pushing people through and making money. Forget customer service.
bad,Hated this job but it was better than having no job so i worked here for a long as i could. After a while i had to look for another job because it was not enough money.
bad,Great place to work if you need paychecks that start immediately. There will not be any advancement or pay increases. The company is currently bankrupt and many locations are closing.
bad,Sears was once a great company. Now it is failing. Not to complain about my local management but from the corporate level probably the worst country in America. They are constantly changing employee pay and cutting benefits.
bad,"its a very busy work environment "
bad,"I was excited when I began working for this company, but I learned in less then one work week  that Sears culture is horrible.  They only care about how many credits  you get while working.Meaning you can be on time, dependable,  have great customer service, but no credits well you get my drift. They do not train you appropriately and sometimes you don't even get breaks. Pay sucks! It's only part time mostly and trust me you will be worked like a slave during those 4 hours. Management sucks (lack  of communication) 99.9 % of the time. I would not recommend anyone work here period. The worst job experience ever! I could go on with things I have experienced working here but it is ultimately  up to whomever  chooses to work here to form their own opinion.  What was not a success to me maybe diffrent for someone else..."
bad,If you are able to find worse coworkers at another job I will be surprised because the people here are very very terrible they have absolutely no respect for anyone who joins the team because this is what they've done for the past 10 years and they're angry because they haven't gotten a raise nor a promotion
bad,"Sears is on the way out. Common sense and customer focus have been replaced with a very apathetic corporate bent, and management (in my experience) seems comfortable letting morale simmer at a very low level. As I understand it, most stores experience the same trouble and disinterest among managing staff; still, I won't presume that of everyone who works for the company."
bad,"They are a terrible company with bad management. There is a reason why the average employee has only worked there a couple months. I was only there for a month because in that short time I was scheduled outside my availability twice, yelled at in front of customers for taking my break less than 10 minutes late(because I was signing up a customer for a credit card) and then when I did go on my break I was yelled at again and mocked for my appearance, and on top of all that I was given the most absurd credit/shop-your-way/store-to-home goals and then had my hours cut when I didn't reach them. The management team is just awful and have no idea how to schedule, treat employees, or be professional."
bad,"Basically the management lacks the basic grasp of how to run a store. Yeah, they set up displays and sales and tell you what to do, but they make horrible decisions, alienate customers and will outright lie to you as staff, to your face, about what they are planning to do. The job culture and co-workers other then that are average, not really a good, close meshed environment, but not at each others throats."
bad,"The company and upper management for the most part is horrible.. It seems to be a company in which if you know someone you get places, and if you don't everything that is wrong with the store is always your fault."
bad,Out of an 8 hour shift you will stand around for at least 6 hours the other 2 will be merchandise pick-ups or building grills or lawn mowers management has no idea how to allocate labor. They don't care about employees or customers. Truly it is one of the worst places I have ever worked.
bad,Institutional memory depleted too many talented managers leaving. Long term planning has suffered and no clear plan to address or fix systemic problems in the organization.
bad,"Good first job"
bad,"I worked mostly in the Kids section of the store. Even though it seemed like a pain in the butt at the time, it was actually a great way to learn for other retail jobs. How to recover, how to put merchandise on the floor, how to update signs, and many more."
bad,"My experience was not good at all, very bad type of management cutting your hours down often very stressful atmosphere: there is always the suspicions that a wave a layoff is coming and may be you will be part of it. No place to growth at all."
bad,"The company seemed to encourage openly deplorable and abusive behavior from it's managers. my store manager would routinely scream obscenities at his employees on the sales floor, the assistant manager would make sexist jokes in the break room, and criticized workers for taking their legally guaranteed breaks. When hired I was told there was room for advancement, and that good work was rewarded, after being hired I learned that the company had frozen wages 6 years earlier, and only gave raises when changes in the minimum wage laws forced them to. My store was closed in a corporate attempt to reduce expenses, putting 82 people out of work, but the CEO gave himself a multi-million dollar bonus."
bad,Not a good place to work and the management team needs serious improvement. The pay is not very good for the location and and the pto is not worth even mentioning.
bad,"Walkers not walking. They help who they want, when they want and surf, eat and chat instead of helping anyone but their friends. Management does as little as possible and have to ask someone else if you all them something. Lunch breaks too short and training is a joke."
bad,"To start of I am a little biased because in a about a month I will be on the street because of this company. I had been working there for over two years and it was generally okay considering Sears is slowly dying and the pay is low so they don't attract the best people that work there. But when I came into work and was told that my job was no more because o a ""restructuring"" I don't really know what goes through these corporate nuts heads but my job was merchandise flow and inventory so they have to replace me with someone else so how is that a restructuring? Thanks for nothing SEARS"
bad,I would strongly advise anyone who has the ability to think for themselves to avoid this sinking ship. Upper management has no concern for their employees work life balance
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. Low hours, minimum wage, horrible management, and a work load that is not only impossible to complete because of the low staffing environment and the unreasonable time restraints that management sets upon you but also deserves twice the amount of compensation that you receive considering how much work is expected of you. There is a reason most people quit working at Sears within a week to a month of being hired. Once they find another job they're gone."
bad,"If I could give this place zero stars, or even convince someone looking into this job to not go into it, then I would have done some good."
bad,"The people I worked with at Sears were great and everyone was a big family. Upper Management and Corporate were horrible. The job for the main part was commission based and they continue to cut commission but expected sales associates to maintain and improve sale quotes. Benefits were not offered, to part-time associates and it was impossible to get a full-time position."
bad,Run as fast as you possibly can from Sears Holdings!!!!  This company is top heavy.  They hire non-retail upper management.  This company is going under VERY quickly!  I wouldn't let my worst enemy work for this company!
bad,Pésimo ambiente de trabajo pues al no tener un sueldo base mis compañeras de divicion peleaban todo el tiempo por los clientes y nadie quería atender la caja ni ponerse a limpiar ni a acomodar y a veces se ponían de acuerdo para no dejar vender a otras compañeras pues según ellas con saludar al cliente ya era de ellas aunque ni lo atendieran y eran unas nacas maleducadas que se ponían a discutir entre ellas como verduleras para quitarse los clientes y lo peor mi jefa que no sabia ni utilizar la computadora y las registradoras del año del caldo. Sears es un lugar donde jamás trabajaría
bad,"I, honestly, really tried to like this corporation, but, due to lack of hours and consistent favoritism between the managers and co-workers was awful. And that's not including the 9 hours a week schedule I was given. I was told that hours were based off of how well you do with Smart Plans and such, which I did very well on. I know this because I had the lead of customer service tell me, and show me the stats. And despite how well I did, my hours have gotten lower and lower. I decided to leave the job since poverty was a factor in it too, to another nearby town. And when I tried to do a transfer, I was forgotten about and the HR people do not do their job. I like the co-workers, but dislike the rest of Kmart. Customers are also treated poorly."
bad,"My fellow coworkers were very excellent, they were fun to work with and we always were laughing as we worked. On the other hand, the customers were always arguing with us. Our managers made the customers and cashiers wait sometimes 10 minutes before they would answer a question, were very snarky and acted as though you were stupid. They gave you very little training once you were hired. I was by myself for my entire shift my second day on the job. I eventually moved to a commissions position to earn more money because you will not make more than minimum wage."
bad,No direction for the company as a whole. Benefits are absolutely terrible. Health Insurance is probably cheaper to get through a 3rd party and no 401K match or bonuses.
bad,"I worked here for 1 month as a cashier and the management was terrible. They were hiring tons of cashiers and were under going new management because the main manager quit. Any ways, I was aware that so many people were quitting but I didn't exactly know why, until I experienced at first hand how terrible the managers are their. Within a month at least 4 people quit including 2 managers and 2 cashiers. Anyways, wouldn't recommend working here unless you like getting scolded for not selling sears credit cards and getting emails from people. And the cash registers are really old and slow it was a terrible experience overall."
bad,"Working here is very hard as every day when you walk in, it is a guarantee  that you will be faced with managers and coworkers who hate their job. There are no advancement opportunities and no raises."
bad,"Sears Holdings in Mobile, AL has been run by the same people for two decades.  They use passive aggressive bullying as a management tactic and anyone who tries to instigate change is ostracized, especially while people.  I have never experienced the unprofessionalism or racial discrimination that I have experienced here."
bad,"I enjoyed my position at Sears Garage Solutions and worked with a great team, the owner of the company and I had differences."
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful "
bad,"This is a sinking company.  It might take a few more years, but it is going under.  I was in Management for 5 years.  It was the worst job ever."
bad,Not the place to work at any level. Not a stable work environment. Too much work for little pay. Do not fall for this. If people wanted to work here they would not be posting on this site considering how large of a company it is lol.
bad,"As a loss prevention associate here and previously in another company  I can say that by far this has been the worst experience as a loss prevention associate. A boss as an  asset protection manager. Not a leader. Always harassing employees. She needs way more training and also way more experience when it comes to security. Does not know anything about it. The pay for such a high risk job? 7.25 an hour. Not good. Whoever is considering working here as loss prevention, specifically at caguas PR, DON'T DO IT. NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"Management did not seem to have a clear idea as to how they wanted to tackle tasks or schedule employees. It would've been 3pm & I'll hear from co-workers that they've been there since 6 that morning & they were asked to stay until close 11pm. I have Multiple Sclerosis, a disability that effects my central nervous system but it really takes a toll on my legs & I told them this during my interview. So one day, I asked if I could leave a little early because my legs were bothering. They laughed & asked me to stay an hour longer. Another instance, they told me to come in on a certain day, forgot & asked me to go home. I take the bus so that was time, energy & money wasted because thy didn't keep up with their own schedule. No one I talked to there had that as their only job or planned to move up in the company. Do with that information what you will"
bad,Variable hours with little training or direction.  Hired as a seasonal employee for the busy holiday season which turned out to be not so busy.
bad,When I began my career at Kmart it was a fun and friendly place to work. I've learned a lot in the past forty years but the environment has changed tremendously and the focuses of the company are no longer to the benefit of the associates.
bad,"I worked there for over 5 years. It's always about how to get the customer to spend more money and up sell them products they don't need. "
bad,"Okay at first thing job is okay. You just ringing stuff up, then only a couple days into it, theyre telling you that you need to push selling Sears credit cards, and if you dont get a certain amount per week, the cut your hours!"
bad,I worked for Kmart for 3 days and the pay is very low and the company prides themselves on working the staff and paying them very low wages. The responsibility of the staff is great but the compensation is unfair. This company is for a person who has no other choice but the work there. The pay is so low the employees cant afford to shop their.
bad,"There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from monotonous tasks to  new projects that were challenging and exciting."
bad,"very terrible... place to work ( w. kellogg - kmart ) store manager is terrible never on time in the opening of store and if isnt on time of course it makes everyone late, but office manager fixs the time so looks as all is ok, but then that has an effect on job performance and being able to complete job in scheduled time which then leads to write ups due to point system then termination. very sorry customer service values as well,   sears is taking a big loss by the brother store. Remember be careful the store manager and office manager are tied tight covering... there own butts, they also have a sorry loss prevention manager that is in  on it too, not only helps themself but allows instore shrink to happen with knowledge with employees that  has worked yrs  together."
bad,"Its probably one of those moments in my life where I am actually unhappy. Normal job is just cashiering, meeting metrics that are never accomplished, and being thrown under the bus by management. I was supposed to be a lead and they promised me the position, but then gave it to someone else even after I was doing schedules and the job for 3 to 5 months. Now at this moment, the store manager is trying to find a reason to fire me. He's sent me home 3 times for doing nothing. I basically get set up to fail. And since its the store manager, there is nothing I can do. Don't work here unless you really have nothing else. But always continue to look. Don't stay here long."
bad,safety record not good very hot place to work in the summers and very cold in the winter months.  Poor leadership no pay raise in seven years.
bad,"Sears doesn't recognize their employees at all.  They have the hardest working employees working for them and they treat everyone horribly.  Can't be promoted internally, they always hire new unqualified people instead of hiring within."
bad,"Overall management is ok, after the big layoff we had the atmosphere changed. Center Manager was fired and that showed us all that our job was not secured."
bad,"As far as call centers go, Sears isn't the worst by any means. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of room for improvement. "
bad,"Most of your management is terrible and worst place ever worked.  Once you step in the place, you can tell that no one is happy.  Never given tools needed to complete job.  Do not work there."
bad,On a day to day basis interacting with customers and helping then find the product that fit their individual needs. My co-workers were a pleasure to work for and were always respectful when I got promoted to Sales Lead. Management in the building lacked the proper leadership skills and were not well liked around the building by the employees. Hardest part of the job is the hours and the shifts you get scheduled.
bad,"Es uan empresa con equipo de computo obsoleto, un departemento de rh muy cuadrado, y los jefes por lo general no saben nada, pero tuve que hacer siempre mi mejor esfuerzo, y ver lo poco bueno en vez de lo malo."
bad,retail politics and favoritism. bad managers that need to to be trained and train employees properly. coworkers were decent people but management cannot learn to adapt to new business culture
bad,"It's 100% commission which is ok if you a use to commission. However; you can lose up to 100% of your commission if you make a mistake on any job, BTW you will definitely make mistakes because the training is not geared for you to be an expert. The customer service is ranked a 1, and you are ALWAYS 2-3 times more expensive than everyone else for the not so good products."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being the only cashier scheduled and being expected to do everything around the store."
bad,"I have been working now for almost 40 years and this is by far the worse business I have ever seen. Scheduling is horrific, management doesn't care about the employees. I could only last at Kmart in Pleasantville NJ for about 6 months. I spoke to management about the scheduling and with no results. You get your schedule on Friday for Sundays workweek start. I do realize we are talking about K,art but, these have to be the dumbest people on the face of the earth that work there. With all that being said the company is a total disgrace and should be put of business before long. Just as a note, I am a former business owner myself and would always pride myself in taking care of my employees. They are the essence of your company. The whole Kmart management think has me baffled! I guess in the long run you get what you pay for. So long Kmart you will be gone soon. Wake up Sears Holding Corp, this surely does not look good for you either."
bad,I owned a Sears franchise store and the best thing I did was terminate contract with Shos.The working environment and the communication between corporate and owners was non existent.
bad,A typical day at work is taking care of customers as best as I could even though my training was limited. I have learned to come out of my shell a lot I spent 10 years of my life driving rig coast to coast. Customer interaction was rough at first I adapted and became good at reaching out to people. The management was not very supportive to the customers they where hard to reach for support. The management concentration over the stores numbers like credit etc seemed to me more important than helping us floor people. I spent ten years owning my trucks running my own business I kept up with my numbers fine. My belief is this you take care of the customer and your numbers you need will be their. If you offer a good product good service good common sense marketing plan and be honest with the customers. I feel business will be booming and not have a dead store with no costumers. I got along with my co workers fine to keep moral up we picked on each other and tried to make the best of a difficult situations. The most hardest part of this job was my deciding to leave. Even though the store was failing I wanted to stick around to help. I felt I needed to leave after finding out what I was selling Sears was not standing behind the product. Then the Purchase protection plan was not worth the paper it was written on. I felt I was selling a lie to the customer. Sorry I will not lie for anyone no matter who you are. Integrity is the most important aspect of business without it a company will fall apart.
bad,Management at Sears makes the environment pretty difficult. Most of management is not qualified or professional. They don't pay very much and advancement is rare. High turnover rate.
bad,"Not worth the headache for the pay that they give, have had no pay raises in over four years."
bad,"There is nothing good to say about this store. Management is unfair, plays favortisim, sits in back and is lazy. There is no work/life balance they don't care if you have a family you could be closing everyday or every weekend and they will not change your schedule to accomadate you at times. All they care about are metrics and numbers. Your job gets threatened every other day for not making credit and other numbers. Management talks behind your back and there are always rumors and drama"
bad,"If you like working hard but get paid nothing compared to other places , then this place is for you. Sears is not going in the right direction."
bad,"Low pay compared to other stores that have Loss Prevention. There is NO good communication among everyone from cashiers to the store manager to the LP team or a good safety plan. It can be a really fun job but it can be VERY dangerous and the pay being poor for what you have to do and not having health insurance if you get hurt because they won't make you full time to get the benefits is what was a concern for me and my co-worker all the time. More or less broken promises, they tell you what you want to hear to keep you going but when it comes time for a pay raise or job advancement they find ANY excuse."
bad,"A typical day at work is consist of answering multiple phone lines, inputting and retrieving data. I've learned over the years how to multi-task effectively.  Some of my co-workers are wonderful people to work with, we have built a great working relationship throughout the years and some friendships. The hardest part of my job is that there is no room for advancement. The most enjoyable part is the people that I work closely with."
bad,This is a failing company that thinks they have all the answers.Try to think outside the box and you will be told to go back to what wasn't working despite any success you've demonstrated.
bad,"I work for sears outlet. Any student or under graduate don't work here. Because, they lie about how much you get pay in your field. Any graduated students with A.S degree should or always get pay hire than anyone without a degree. But, I witness first hand how each sale associated get pay by minimum wage. All students  or post graduate with A.S degree should always get pay more than employees who don't have a degree. Things have change for years that students or post suppose to get pay more than average employees. I think you need face fact."
bad,"Sears refuses to work you 40 hours ever. 7.25 doesn't make sense when they work you so hard. I've had to unload a semi-trailer by myself and all I heard from management was how long it took."
bad,"The company is undergoing deep cash flow issues with an uncertain future of further employment.  Apparently restructuring is performed annually about this time of the year, and that has become the culture for most tenured employees.  Progress is uncertain."
bad,"Management was completely incompetent and unable to see that the ""changes"" simply did not work and were slowly ruining the store and driving away customers. Unrealistic goals across the board. Terrible wages, they taunt you with the idea of commission, but you make less than 1% commission and will struggle to earn more than 8 dollars per hour on a good day. Also the associate discount is less than the average customer gets with a coupon."
bad,"Sears continues its downward spiral.  Call center job, bad compensation for associates, pay not comparable, yet they demand so much from them.  People are treated like robots. Their culture did not embrace employees as critical participants of their success.  "
bad,"Sears Lake Mary is always hiring and letting employees go.  When the location needs warm bodies they hire massive amounts of people and in the slow season they layoff, reduce hours and strickly enforce policy to clean house,  This is a very unstable place to work.      Employees are treated like children and there is no room for advancememnt and clearly even if you are promoted, the managment will down grade a person's position with little to no notice.  Many of the the canidates that are hired depart before the end of training when they begin to undrstand the position and see the environment."
bad,travail assis. aide au personnel en magasins/comptoirs en place.
bad,"Sears has prospective plans for expedience route to bankruptcy. They have authorized all technicians to endow their customers with however unreasonable wishes. This economic suicide is accomplished by creation of a grade system under which, the arbitrary, illogical, capricious, subjective and very often bias opinion of their customers has profound effect on technician ranking place. Nationwide, Sears technicians, to protect themselves from low grade survey status -which by the way compromises their job security, are heartwarming their customers with cornucopia of free stuff. The survey ensue -make as much sense as to ask a cow about its experience right after it has been milked to the very last drop (Sears modest fees for service) To add salt to the wound, the cow has to answer if it wants to do it again and if it would recommend it to other cows in the herd- Sears wonderful milking scheme ."
bad,"They don't pay well and don't provide great benefits either, so why stay?  Look for another job if you have this job."
bad,"I worked in the elyria store and the north olmsted store both in ohio, the management was horrible for both they don't care about the employees they only care about looking good to corporate, sears in elyria gave me one day a week then completely took my off the schedule then I go to check if they put me back on and it says I'm a former employee, so sears fired me with zero reason and didn't even have the audacity to tell me. I do not recommend anyone to work here, it's total b.s. All they care about is who signs people up for credit apps, and if you don't get a lot you're frowned upon. I wasn't even trained they told me since I was a rehire (haven't worked at a Sears store in a year) they said I didn't need to be trained so I was thrown on the register to fend for myself and anytime I asked a fellow employee for help they got rude with me. I'm writing a letter to corp, I regret ever applying."
bad,"Low pay, immature management, no room for advancement, every employee in a lead position or above is power hungry and thinks they are the boss."
bad,"I had applied with Sears on a Friday and on a Monday I was invited to a career fair on a Tuesday. I went, got hired and it took three weeks before I started working. Additionally, I was originally hired for Customer Solutions, that is what the original offer e-mail was for, was for Customer Solutions. Then, when I got a call from one of the HR managers to come up and take my picture for my badge she had the final offer letter and it was for Delivery Solutions which is bottom of the barrel. I asked her why this was she said ""Well, we needed more people in DS than CS"" I said okay and just accepted it. I went in for training and the trainer did nothing but talk about her personal life, her boyfriend, her kids, her this, her that and wanted to show us videos on YouTube. We wasted so much time, I was there to learn how to do my job! NOT to learn about your kids or your boyfriend... trust me when I say I don't  care about those elements in your life! So after three weeks we went into nesting. It was a complete disaster. Nobody knew how to do anything and it was so bad they gave us three extra grueling days of training. I learned more in three days than I did in three weeks of being in a class room. I would NOT recommend this job at all what so ever unless you are desperate and are on the verge of going homeless or starving to death. I noticed the company has a VERY high turn over rate, to be honest I knew it when I went to he career fair. If a company has to have monthly career fairs and they hire anywhere from 75 to 150 people that mean a lot of people come and go. My mom pointed"
bad,Management doesnt care about their emplyees. Alot of 'clicks' with immature middle aged women. No room for improvement. Just wouldnt reccomend it.
bad,"When I worked there I was always required to just stand there at the register all day every day..I hated that. I wanted to be able to be out on the floor and assisting customers myself, instead of standing at the register and have to call someone over, when I already knew where something was. Also, there was a strong emphasis on getting customers to sign up for Sears credit cards. I watched other employees trick customers into getting the cards for their own personal commission. I understand people need money, but I'm not willing to lie for it."
bad,"The Rating is for MXD Group & Sears (not Sears stores). MXD Group has the contract for delivery of Sears merchandise. My Company was sub contracted by them. "
bad,"Job entailed 3 weeks of paid training, then 2 weeks without pay."
bad,"Managers are expected to work a minimum of 55-65hrs, so yes the pay is better, but after you add the extra hours you actually are getting paid less per hour."
bad,"The pay is very low for what you have to deal with day to day. I was doing managers job because they didn't want to walk all the way to the front of the store. The HR manager for the store was one of the most insensitive people I have ever met. There were HUGE roaches by the bathrooms. It gets very hot up at the front of the store and they won't let you have a fan or water apparently they would rather you pass out. But I made some really good friend while I was there, that was the best part."
bad,"Sears Portrait has closed but when I worked there, there were no benefits what's ever. You worked alone 90% of the time. No hours because of no customers."
bad,"unorganized management, a lot of youth as coworkers. The hardest part of the job is learning how to lift refrigerators when you first start working. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and actually building a relationship with them"
bad,"This was an ok place to work for if you can pass the testing procedure during the application process, if you work there and quit they won't ever take you back so they don't support the former employees."
bad,"Simply one of the worst jobs I ever had. Unreachable goals asked of all employees. No raises, bonuses, ect unless you work in appliances. They make you work extended and unthinkable hours for holidays. Underpaid and under appreciated employees. Classic corporate environment where you simply do not matter because you are replaceable."
bad,"It's all just stress. The management does not know what they are doing. I've worked two years here, working my butt off, no raise, no recognition for my work. I've been injured here with no compensation. It is not fun. The best part of this job was my coworkers, I stayed for them."
bad,everyday at work is stressful. Management doesn't really care about the store and they care about how much money they make. The only enjoyable part of this job is when my shift is over
bad,0 Management is really bad. They never have any thing good to contribute to associates
bad,This company is quickly plummeting and I for one am not waiting around for the fallout.
bad,she would constantly watch you. make you feel very uncomfortable
bad,"Pays minimum wages, minimum hours, gives NO bonuses, NO raises, NO benefits and NO  incentives to advance.  You are JUST a clock number to the company, nothing more. They have a full time person who's #1 job is to find reasons to fire employees."
bad,"Every year the strategy changes."
bad,la parte mas difícil la económica necesidad de aumento de salario
bad,"Sears was a horrible place to work. Please reconsider working there and try to find somewhere else. If you are a teenager looking for a first time job, then this will work great for you. Otherwise, there is no job security, no benefits, pay is horrible, and management has no clue what they are doing."
bad,It was a blessing to have so many great customer's within my time here. I'll normally sell store credit cards all day and assist any customer on and off the register. I open and close the store mostly throughout the week. The hardest part was growing in the company. There wasn't a opportunity.
bad,The new manager don't appreciate or tends to help out when needed
bad,"Old out dated methods of micro management."
bad,"A typical day at sears is trying to figure out what is supposed to be done and where product is."
bad,"Not good for career advancement or salary. Great health care insurance, however very expensive."
bad,"Lots of kids work for sears and I see why. R.... the manager at the Wolfchase Location in Memphis TN is terrible, no people skills at all,  they do not know how to train nor talk to people.  They are rude with the customers and the cashiers stand around talking while the customers wait in line.  the pay is horrible and I would not let my dog work there.  Yes I quit I would not ever shop there again"
bad,Senior management mired in personal vendettas and power trips that come out against associates with no reasonable connections. Corporate policies designed to drive the online front at the cost of the brick and mortar stores.
bad,"Its a fast learned place the co-workers management the people that inter store the easy place to work and enjoyed every minute of it was"
bad,"very bad company to work for."
bad,"I work as an appliance sales associate, and make good money at times despite the cuts in commission rates during major sales, causing us to starve during the two weeks prior to the sales as people are waiting to purchase, the cut of 1.2 percent commission if you price matchyour own company online at ""Sears.com."" as well as other sites, the 4 managers that I have had in the last 2 years, the constant work cleaning and bringing out refrigerators and unpacking them from boxes, as well as stoves etc, the inventory floorplan, and display checklist that we performed every week setting out and moving the appliances, all the unpaid training that you are expected to complete each month, the constant bombardment of expectations as to your metrics, the micro management, taking away the one chair that was at a computer station so you want ever sit down, the poor morale, also am now an expert at buffing stainless steel, never mind doing that in dress clothes, not having enough digital equipment to use to satisfy the requirements of ringing sales on the ipad that alot of times doesn't work, etc. Other than that its a great place to work!"
bad,"Loss Prevention consist of me monitoring systems closed circuit television.Greet, qualify, recommend and close every customer in their department, and know how to handle basics in adjacent departments. The hardest part of the job was not being able to apprehend anyone on my shift."
bad,Certain management is always willing to with with you and help you. Some however were not.
bad,"benefits: your benefits are bunch of coupons that you can probably get from a magazine or coupon app and NO you do NOT GET A DISCOUNT ON ANYTHING."
bad,"You Do EVERYTHING !!!! Checkout, clean fitting rooms, fold clothes, cover 2-3 areas, get yelled at by customers because your the only one running 2-3 areas, call Managers for help Nope they're always on conference calls, but the angry customer can leave their name and number and if we remember well call them back. Ok back to what you do clean bathrooms, markdown Clrx, Freight and that's just the physical stuff! You also must get credit apps lots of them or management will cut your hours and write you up! And Rewards cards not doing well hello write-ups! Save yourself the headache TRUST ME"
bad,"purely commission, high ticket price of product, either survive or die environment."
bad,"Overall the worst place I have ever decided to earn money from. The hours and managers were horrible,"
bad,"A general day at work for me consisted of going to the shop and checking on the vehicles already having repairs done and the heading out to the sales floor. If there were customers I'd take their information down and have someone start working on it. Normally there would be a few vehicles that needed parts that we didn't have so I'd have to call a dealer or parts store to get them. If the manager was in and nothing was going on he'd have us sales associates and the technicians do some remedial task like clean the machines, often leaving no one on the sales floor.  "
bad,"Management does not care much about their associates or customers. All management sees is profit. I used to enjoy working for Sears but now there are just too many demands; too much questions to ask the customer. The hardest part of the job is trying to force the customer to apply for a credit card. Even when you do so, it seems like it is not good enough to management. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."
bad,"There was barely a typical day at work. I did not learn anything more than my previous job. Management was horrible, they lacked in protocol. The majority of the coworkers were older but they were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was knowing exactly what item the customer would refer to or if they ask what item was best for a particular situation. This was only hard because the time that I was scheduled to work I didn't have anyone to actually walk me through. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfaction of the customers and conversation and of closing."
bad,No hours no raises no respect. This company should be ashamed!! How do you not give your employees at least one raise. Gotta deal with irate customers all the time. Coworkers that don't want the job So now you have to take up their slack. I am definitely looking for Other employment soon. I would not recommend this company anyone. I am a very hard worker and deserve more than I am getting. Plus you have to deal with management showing favoritism To certain employees
bad,"Sale TV's"
bad,Poor company with a lack of communication and guidance from management.  There is no room for growth or acknowledgement of job accomplishments.  No incentives to work hard or beyond your job requirements/description.  Highly not recommended.
bad,"Does not give promotions"
bad,"Your typical day at sears as a cashier is to go to your cash wrap as the previous cashier leaves and stand in the box to wait until a customer comes to you. If you are lucky you will be placed in a busier section of the store such as mens or hardwhere (where there are other associates in lawn and garden) but otherwise for your shift you stand by yourself and wait. Sometimes you are lucky to get a task by the MCA's but most of the time it is waiting. The managment is not the best either. They will make promises that will never come true just so you will work there. The co-workers are the best part, even tho the turnover is so high you can barely get to know the new ones. As a cashier you are also expected to make very high goals regardless of how busy you are. These are made by tricking customers to keep your job. "
bad,For as much work/effort required this position is not worth it by a long shot.
bad,"i have worked with this company for 3 years and have never gotten a raise or even given a chance to move up. i work my butt off and my managers always tell me what a great job im doing and tell me what i leader i am among my peers but any time a higher position comes up the hire someone new from outside the company who i then have to teach how to do their job.... the management is terrible as well, none of the leads or managers talk to each other so its very common to get 4-5 different set of directions and get yelled at by all for not doing something their way. and when i asked for a couple days 2 months in advance i was told no and was written up for calling off. this company is the poster child for worst. job. ever."
bad,"No need to fill space. This was an awful place to work. Minimum wage, no hope for a raise (coworkers had several years in, still working for minimum wage), and scheduling was ridiculous. The amount of hours scheduled was fine, but after repeated scheduling conflicts with my full-time class schedule, the formal write-ups for not getting to the incorrectly scheduled shifts, and their repeated inability to work around my unchanging class schedule (which I provided to them repeatedly), I was forced to quit. However, I did thoroughly enjoy many of my coworkers. They are a hard working crew, and they all deserve much more than they are duped into believing is acceptable."
bad,"I had a busy store and was the only employee most of the time. I had back to back sits, a work load that was meant for two or more photographers. This left me little or no time to get to the other things needing done. I often felt like I was rushing the customer so I could get onto the next one and often left me unable to take a break or lunch. We were only open a few days per week which did not give me much room to space out my sittings. I received training on editing in lightroom, posing groups and individuals, managing a studio and employees. I had two great District Mangers and amazing coworkers at other locations. The hardest part of the job was in the last few weeks wondering when and if my studio would be one of the studios to close. After I took over the studio, business started improving but was always fearful it was to little to late. I knew they were planning to close some studios but we were all blindsided by the closing of all studios. I loved MY customers and quite a few became friends some more like family."
bad,"I'm a former employee at Sears in Salem, NH. That store is the worst store you could ever work at, the manager doesn't do their job right at all. I dedicated a lot to this company and got nothing in return. WORSE PLACE TO WORK AT, TRUST ME."
bad,"Work day began reviewing and working on the previous days work tickets, at the same time fielding phone calls and answering emails."
bad,"This is the most unorganized company from the call center I work to the way they conduct business with customers. Customers are not put first. Employees barely know their managers and there is no sense of job security. Upper management has no idea what a regular agents job is like, and has no relationship with their employees."
bad,a typical day is doing customer service and using the cash register.
bad,"Terrible , do not work for sears and do not shop there either...."
bad,My first Sear that I worked for was wonderful. I was a Shoe Dept. Lead and was even given the opp. to move up in Management. Then I had to move and was tranfered to a different Sears. These two Sears was like night and day. The second Sears did not repect their employees and there was a lot of favorites. I worked for this company for two years and when I got transfered I was demoted and not because of my work.
bad,"Selling Merchandise, fixing everyone elses screw ups, answering questions, helping other associates answer questions, and transactions. I learned being patient is the biggest factor when being envolved with retail, the customer is always right, and to never let anyone get the best of you. I had some of the greatest managers someone could work for in Lawton. However, when I came to wichita it was completely different. Hardest part of my job, not getting annoyed at the very poor manangement we had. The most enjoyable are the people, you meet new and exciting people everyday. They're always upset or mad about something, but you can make them leave with a smile and knowing that they're always taken care of."
bad,"i'll be surprised if sears is still in business in 6 years. Terrible place to be an employee for. No raises, bad benefits, just not good."
bad,"worked there for over a year, never received a raise. The new hirees get paid more than the ones that have been there longer. UNFAIR company, DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS EMPLOYEES. THEY WORK YOU LIKE SLAVES. Was yelled at on a daily basis by customers for issues that the company was at fault for. The studio was always understaffed & OVERBOOKED, leaving many customers angry & because of this i had to deal with customers yelling for ANOTHER issue that i had nothing to do with. I NEVER GOT OVERTIME BUT WAS ALWAYS WORKING PAST THE TIME THAT I WAS SCHEDULED BECAUSE OF THE OVERBOOKING. OVERALL, THE WORST COMPANY TO EVER WORK FOR. THEY ARE CHEAP & DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES, I WOULD NEVERRRRRRRRRRRR RECOMEND THAT ANYONE APPLY FOR THIS JOB. THE ONLY PART I EVER ENJOYED WORKING HERE WERE MY BREAKS & WHEN I WAS LEAVING TO GO HOME. IF YOU LIKE EXTREME AMOUNTS OF STRESS, THEN THIS IS THE JOB FOR YOU."
bad,"With one bad visit from a V.P,you can be out of a job, can't pay your bills, and yet have worked for the company for years."
bad,I had to figure out and let everyone on the team know what needed to be done. I had to train my boss. The boss was always asking me what to do. managers were rude. Some of the co workers were lazy which no manager said anything to them. I had to do most of the work by myself. Company did not give raises and managers only promote their favorite no matter who was most qualified. I enjoyed working with customers.
bad,"A typical day would be waking up going to school then cv-tec after cv-tec was done i go to work till closing which was nine, co workers were always talking behind my back or coming up to me telling me the manager was talking about canning me, then after I wasnt even working there anymore one of the guys from there had hacked my facebook page, and when i was going home one day one of them decided to tailget me only part of this job I miss is the check."
bad,"Sears seems like a good place to work, untill you work there. The management is beyond poor. They write you up for everything and consistantly go out of their way to target someone they don't like and do what ever it takes to get them to quit. If you apply to be a cashier good luck keeping your job. In my two years at sears the entire cashier force was replaced within 2 months only a few make it. You are expected to do a lot but are compinsated poorly for it. You will not get a raise and commission on clothing is 2% and thats only if you get someone to buy it online in store. The customers for the most part weren't to bad of course theres some rude ones its a retail store. Overall this company has gone down the drain and my recent experience there shows a great deal on how it has. The co workers are friendly but management lacks leadership and common knowledge."
bad,there is no trust to employees from management. there needs to be a compatable work enviroment to establish a good store for customers to feel welcome.
bad,this is the worst job i have ever held and if it wasnt for needing a job i would have quit soon after walking in the door. pay is alright management is very very very poor
bad,"he employees were all very negative and unhappy. On my first day alone I had THREE employees on the floor tell me to quit now because I'll hate it and the only reason why they have stayed is because they cant find another job. 2. Management is incompetent and largely absent. During my first week my manager (and suposed trainer) spoke to me only twice. The first time I saw her she showed me where my department was and then said she was going to lunch leaving no instruction. The second time she was walking by and HAPPENED to tell me that she had moved me to the womens department instead. 3. They WONT train you. BUT they will expect you to know what to do. They made me sit through hours of ""online training"" that was really just describing corporate policy that didnt relate to the job, but when it came to what I was actually suposed to be doing on the floor? I got nothing! Like I said, my manager took me up to the floor my first day and said she was going to lunch leaving no instruction and NO go to person on the floor to ask questions. She didnt check in again until four days later! And the other employees were no help in training because THEY had never been trained as well! And in addition, most of them had only been working a short time as well. 4. NO support system! If you have a problem with a customer, a question about an item or anything, 9/10 the managers wont even be available--granted, you will have to know how to reach your manager before you would be able to find out if they are available or not--something they DONT train you how to do. 5. Pay is BELOW retail average."
bad,They have more managers than employees. You can already imagine sweating for minimum wage while 5 managers monitor your performance. I even overheard a few discussing a replacement for me on my first day. Apparently the fact that I needed training wasn't acceptable.
bad,"all engine repair jobs, including timing jobs, electrical repairs in all imports cars especial Germany made."
bad,This place promises a long term career but the truth is that they will fire you if they do not like you and they will disguise it by telling you about some dumb policy
bad,If you don't believe me apply there its ran by Napoleon and his royal weird subjects
bad,"The company is still trying to find itself. There is no concern for work/life balance, only what can you do for them. Employee safety is at the bottom of their list, especially if you are in a dangerous neighborhood. Would not work for this company again if it was the only job in America!"
bad,"The two tiered union made the workplace a very difficult enviornment. The culture of us against them between the older employees as well as management in regards to the new employees was very disappointing. I found very few positives while working here. In all, not a place I would want to return to."
bad,Good pay but worst place to work. All non proffessional people around. I regined from this company within 6 months.
bad,This company has gone down hill with its value to there associates and customers. Most of what i learned was from my co-workers.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager. The manager has poor ethics and only cares about himself and his money.
bad,A nice job to start out with when looking for a nice part time job aside from a full time job
bad,"if by the small chance you get a raise, it will be ten cents every 5 years and they start at minimum wage. They aren't allowed to give you 5s on your evaluation, which is what raises are based on. The joke around there is that when minimum wage goes up, everyone gets a raise. And they expect you to ignore your family. They fired me because my kid got sick at school and i had to miss a day, even though i followed protocol and called the absentee line well in advance."
bad,There was very little customer interaction because it was a slow store.
bad,"If you don't get as many people as you can to sign up for their credit cards and shop your way cards, you're fired. As long as you meet your quota for the month, they don't care about sales or call offs. They hire and fire like it's no big deal. You're expected to do your job and whatever else they think up for you. Management will tell you to do things you're legally not allowed to do. If you need time off for anything, you will work every day before that day. If you can't come in every morning, you'll work 1-9 every day of your life. Co workers do whatever they want and it's allowed if they're up in credit. You're the one to blame if people are smart and don't want the credit cards. The way the store is set up is just completely unethical. I hope this store goes under. Co workers will also take as long as they want for lunch when you're only allowed 30 minutes. If you work with smokers, you'll work by yourself while they take ten smoke breaks."
bad,"Working at Sears is not worth the hassle, the management is a joke, you are pressured to up-sell credit cards every transaction and if you don't, your hours will be cut and you will be written up."
bad,"Management is not concerned about the individual, but only sees their employees as numbers. The turnover rate is very high. There is a lack of motivation and morale, and it is not career oriented. There isn't a realistic plan to elevate or promote to another position."
bad,Not a good company to work for lied to employees and customers people would leave while in training hated it every day no no no no negative environment
bad,There are no longer any customers to sell to. The original Sears has declared bankruptcy. Our previous customers now shop elsewhere. The future of the remains of the company does not look viable.
bad,employed for 10 yrs. in the beginning was a fun team working group. towards the end. mindless management who barked out orders and barely did work themselves. sad to report these finding
bad,"customer service  Work long hours. Company do not give raises, call center environment working with different type of customers that need their appliance serviced"
bad,"I think sears Holdings would have been a great place to work. But they got too big and could not control/manage the remodel side of the business. "
bad,"Sears was a pretty terrible job overall. The pay was poor, the hours were bad, the work environment was dingy, the morale was low, the management was incompetent, and the job security was nonexistent. It provided with a first job, and that experience was enough to get me in elsewhere, which is good because the store I worked at later closed."
bad,Easy repetitious job once caught on. Very poor unprofessional management constantly on social media until last 2 hours of work and pushed to complete work with no assist to workers when needed without attitude.
bad,"Health insurance extremely expensive and coverage is horrible! "
bad,"It's pretty basic.  You start at minimum wage.  I was there three years without a pay raise or anything.  It's pretty simple once you get used to it.  Unloading the truck twice a week takes forever.  You cut open every single box and take the merchandise out and load it onto carts for the floor sales people to handle. You also handle the merchandise pickup section.  When someone orders a big item such as a stove, they bring the receipt, scan it and then you go and locate the item in the back and bring it up to load for them."
bad,"The job was fine, my coworkers were very nice, but management was not, because they want it us to save the company. plus every day they would change the way they wanted us to work, so it was very hard to keep up with all the changes."
bad,"When I first was hired at Sears Grand it was great. A new environment and the hours were flexible enough for me to attend school. The compensation was not anything you could live off of which was really disappointing. The management was poor especially when I left, the store manager, was ex-military and talked down to people on a daily. The goals that were asked were near to impossible. I definitely would not recommend Sears Grand to anyone."
bad,"Work Laptop barely worked. I never saw the managers, and they didn’t help a whole lot. Customers were always mad if they had an LG fridge not cooling/ bad compressor. Drove all over several counties, instead of staying around mine. Never trained me on other appliances like I was told I would be."
bad,"Just not worth it. Take a few bucks less an hour and work somewhere else. The managers try their best, but not all of them are the best or nicest. Coworkers vary as it is a very odd melting pot of people. Upper brass is god awful and with the company failing it was just more rules and regulations and scripting and it sucks your soul. Constant mandtory overtime followed by begging people to go home when call volume plummets. Not worth it."
bad,I didn’t work here long. Don’t waste your time applying. You barely get hours and you’ll be bored to death because it’s always slow. The pay rate is very low.
bad,It was too much work for loo little money. They would ask for near impossible things of you and most of the time it just wouldn't work out. The people there were rude and there was no trust among anyone and people would blow up on eachother almost daily. The managers would seem to not even care. There was nothing you could do to get help with anyone or anything really.
bad,"Starting a new HVAC only department. Laptop computer system did not work with hours in the department. Coverage area was ridiculous. From the Milwaukee area to Rockford, Illinois. Finnish the day, and getting paid, in Illinois. Hour and a half to two hour drive home through rush hour traffic. "
bad,"You never know what time you’ll be off, so making plans with family is hard. You can break your back, leg or arm and management will still ask if you made a sale. As a previous  preventative maintenance tech, they’ll abuse the heck out of your schedule. You’ll start off in Riverside, the Moreno Valley, then in Whittier to Anaheim, then end off your day in Arcadia. Sears routing is the worst when it comes to scheduling. Too many rule changes. They say be a technician not a salesman. Screw that, it’s all about sales. And if you can’t make sales, then you’re out of luck with a job. Pay was good but not worth them abusing your schedule. Honestly, enter that job at your own risk. If you’re a salesman then you’re good. Heads up, don’t be a refer tech, you’ll do 12+ hours a day and still expect sales. Sears isn’t what it used to be."
bad,"Low pay, terrible leads, terrible management, upper managt driven by their pyramid-like % commission. Work you 6 days per week up to 14 hours per day . Terrible work life management"
bad,The days were long and you would be stuck in an area that the management hoped you would be able to bs. The compensation was lousy for all the attitude and down nose comments you received.
bad,"There were very few people working as a Backroom Associate at the location I was working, so doing all of the required tasks was difficult. Daily trucks came in to restock the backroom which we had to clear along with doing our assigned duties. The management was very poor as they did not care about the people working. Very few new people stayed with this Sears for more than 3 months."
bad,"High turnover. I witnessed a veteran 25y employee forced to do new tasks they could not navigate at their advanced age. The employee was forced to resign. This was a pattern. Management valued high pressure sales of high markup refrigerator water filters and condenser cleaning brushes above all else. Parts sales were secondary, and the bum's rush was given to the home craftsman who needed obscure parts for woodworking equipment. Horrible working conditions with not enough work stations with broken chairs, non-functioning computers. ""Turn and Burn"" was a favorite catch phrase."
bad,"The Sears Holdings call center was a typical call center. It had very strict rules regarding attendance, poor management, and minimal breaks. As expected, many employees violated the no-phone policy and other ""auto-termination"" rules."
bad,Not paid enough for the work that we do. we are always told to take on multiple assignments without any real direction. Staff that has been there were super friendly some managers didn't even know what to do.
bad,Never in all my years have I worked for a company that worked hard at chasing their own tail. They just can't seem to find there way in today's environment.
bad,"Now bankrupt!  What to do from here?  The store was struggling for so long, and the CEO refused to listen to experienced personnel at executive level to make company more competitive and profitable.   He had his own ajenda.  Then, when it was to late to save it, he started implementation of ideas suggested from long before.   Too little...too late!"
bad,"No one cares, everyone is underpaid. Everyone is looking for another job                                                                      ..................................."
bad,"cashier and customer service retail. folding clothes for presentation. keeping store clean and helping customers throughout the day. Poor management, no benefits for part time employees."
bad,I had two different bosses in the short time I held my position. I took the position as I was shown a business model based on a model in which I would be working for myself for all intents and purposes. The business model changed and so I moved on.
bad,"This company is swirling the drain.  Stay away unless you want to go with ship.  This company is eliminated positions, and is on a wage freeze.  Metaphorically the building is on fire and they are worried about cutting the grass.  This company is dead, they just haven't finished burying the body."
bad,"The store I worked in had a good group of people and we all got along. However, we needed about double the staff we had. Nobody for customer assistance. Customers would need to trek down to the first floor to check out because there was no staffed cashwrap on the second floor. Company does not value employees. Employee discount was discontinued. No upside to work at Sears."
bad,"I had to stop working there since my hours were cut in half. Plus they expected a lot of work for very little pay from employees. They paid minimwage to most of employees. I DID LEARN A LOT ON HOW TO RESET A STORE, with decorating and doing planograms. Also learned how to be a jewelry clerk and always helped with doing inventory and working in receiving. I learned how do be able to work in every part of store."
bad,"Due to the lack of customer traffic, the job can be very boring and you are left with nothing to do. The customers can be very rude and the managers are lazy. The bad employee scheduling leaves only about one or two people left at the registers at a time. At my store there were constant corporate visits. It is very clear that the Sears company is failing and soon all the stores will be gone."
bad,I was with Sears for 2 years. In that time we went through 3 different store managers and for a time no manager. The store was extremely disorganized and most employees did not get along with each other. They have since gone out of business.
bad,"Sears, a company that has been around for a hundred and fifty to nearly two hundred years (five or take a decade or two) has fallen on hard times. It was once a wonderful company to work for with great benefits and competative wages, however that is no longer the case. Now, individuals who work for Sears no longer get raises, you're locked into specific pay based on your minimum wage of your state or what have you should you get lucky enough to get a promotion because someone was fired or left the company. Since taking the position of Store Support Lead I have had, at most, a hundred and thirteen hours average to split between eight people, three of which are used specifically for keeping the backroom, merchandise pick-up, and online purchases running. three others are for signing, keeping shoes looking good and stocked and making sure HR is properly manned. I normally operate with about 14 hours cut each week. That is taken into account with the average I gave above. Now, if a store in our district falls under a percentage of online orders filled, that store is shut down from being able to take any online orders, however, that means all other online orders are then re-directed to other stores and those stores are not given hours to properly compensate the amount of purchases we have to fill. So add in the fact that there is only two of us, with no over lap, per day, on top of other duties we are pulled for, not including individuals coming to pick up their products they have ordered or truck coming in, we are often times left unable to fulfill other duties, such as return to"
bad,"The policies regarding customer merchandise pickup were lofty sometimes.  Any customer merchandise had to be ready at the pickup location of the store within five minutes.  However, some of the stock was on the second floor and poorly organized or more often inaccurately inventoried.  Unloading very heavy freight from a semi truck was very uncollaborative, depending who was on duty."
bad,"Sears Holdings was a workplace with many pleasant people I enjoyed my 6 years with.  The upper management does not seem to be able to grasp or is unwilling to invest in retail.  The CEO came from another background and it shows.  Many of the policies were not customer-friendly and I saw negative HR processes in which people who worked hard for the company were treated badly.  The overall turnover in the store was horrendous, although not in my department."
bad,"I left Sears do to lack of hours, lack of pay increses even by a cent. ( been with the company for six years.)  asking for time off even for school exams was almost like going through an act of congress.  In the end my final reason to leave this company was due to the asbestos found only to exist in the employee halls and lunch room."
bad,A dreadful place to work. Was not allowed to implement my full abilities because I had to take classes first and it takes an act of congress to be able to take those classes.. The pay was very poor to say the least. It was over regulated. Health insurance was very expensive. The managers cared nothing about our well being. Holidays were a joke...I could go on and on but too much to list..
bad,Working for Sears was an overall disappointing experience. I had no support from upper management. And my peers were really out to get one another almost all the time. Basically a toxic environment to work in.
bad,"I worked for Sears for 8 years, and only received 1 raise of .36. Moving all jobs overseas.  No benefits.  Managers are great.  I was proud to work for Sears, but no company loyalty and no raise made me have to go elsewhere."
bad,This was my longest high School isn't job. It was excruciatingly boring and the money was terrible. Still for that time in my life it was alright. Nice management.
bad,"Communication is key and Sears did not have the key for it. Associates are underappreciated and deserve more, can seem like a nice relaxed place but Sears doesn't sacrifice anything for you except for you as the associate for money."
bad,Worked here in high school and it was a terrible first job. The stress they give you is not worth the amount of money you are getting paid. Employees were lazy and so was management. No raises and no chance of advancement.
bad,"I didn't mind working at sears until they cut my hours down from 5 days a week to 2 because I wasn't signing enough people to their credit card. Which seemed next to impossible with the awful interest rate. Most of the management doesn't seem to care much about their employees, and the way is awful. But it is retail so that is to be expected."
bad,Run don't walk from this failing company.  Full of bureaucrats who spend all day in phone meetings that lead nowhere while the stores are completely neglected as they fall into disrepair.
bad,"The managers have no idea what they are doing. They put leads to run the store that aren't fully trained and cant answer questions if it is needed. It is a very slow store barely any customers unless it is a Saturday then it is somewhat busy. When you first start they barely train you and you have to learn on your own. The managers don't train you its another associate which is so lazy of them. I don't suggest this job for a career or as a stable job because the hours go up and down there's no guarantee you'll have hours by the next week. Another thing is credit, they demand a inapplicable amount of credit cards that we are supposed to pitch which is insane."
bad,"no chance for pay raise, no vacations, if your sick you need a drs note, serious lack of teamwork.very pushy about getting credit card apps. to the point of threats of termination if you dont get one. no in store LP person, so associates are to sell to customers,act as LP, clean up their areas, and cover for managers when they are in a meeting."
bad,"I worked as a merchandise assist floor associate, assisting customers, store recovery, fitting rooms and replenishment. I worked 3 1/2 hour shifts typically 2 days a week and received no work benefit except for the associate discount. I felt unappreciated and overlooked by both coworkers and management despite my positive and upbeat attitude. Everyone who works there looks and tends to act cranky, upset or exhausted."
bad,co-workers helped others but management style is not a good one. I had very little training and had to learn a lot by learn by doing. only a few co workers were helpful with learning and/or training for the position.
bad,Most mismanaged place I have ever worked! From top to bottom best way to describe A & E is USED CAR SALESMAN SHADY!!!!!!! They don't care about clients only what you can sell. They don't use new parts but the majority of the time you are forced to use sub par refurbished parts then lie to customers especially kenmore equipment under warranty.
bad,In the years I was there Sears Holdings never had a positive comp YOY.  Management made short sighted cost cutting decisions (cutting ads)and culture/morale was horrible
bad,This was basically a contract position. Each worker was treated as an independent contractor except they withheld taxes from pay. They also withheld a percentage of pay for customer call-backs which was extremely difficult to get back.They had too many employees on hand for the amount of work. Thus the best contracts were given to favorite workers and the rest caught the dregs. Support was minimal to non-exsistant. Did have a good balance with family because got to spent more time than I wanted with them.
bad,"Sears was a great place to work, when I started there. Then it was sold to a real estate tycoon. He only cared about the real estate, and I feel like he hoped the business would fail. All he cared about was making money from the real estate. The only retail experience he had, was that his mother worked for Nordstrom’s, when he was a child."
bad,Revolving door seens the company is putting money ahead of everything like a moneygrab even with management revolving door. They bring in college kids to be managers that have no exp repairing anything
bad,"Slow paced work environment, Understaffed with little training and few management incentives. The hardest part of the job  was finding opportunities to advance."
bad,"Terrible Management, Company was not forward thinking which ended abruptly. Staff was not treated with respect and new management was unheard and asked to go with the current flow of Sears."
bad,Working at sears is depressing. Don't hope to move up. I ran my department for months because my manager was running 4 departments. After applying and going through 3 interviews  i was denied my promotion as they brought in a manager from a closing site. I was thanked for applying and encouraged to continue to taking an active role in running my department in my current role with no raise.
bad,"If you like being belittled by the managers, lied to by the company, cussed at by the customer and taken advantage of by Sears, then this is the place for you. The commission is based on a percentage of sales, which is set to a very high bar.The calls distributed based on your sale percentage and dollar amount, so calls for purchases go to people with high levels and information calls go to people with lower levels. This way if you have a high level you are guaranteed higher commission and if you start with a lower level (or are new) you do not get callers who want to make purchases but are calling to complain, make returns, want information or to be transferred to a store which you are unable to do. All of these lower your level and worsen your level, permanently keeping you at a low level. Most of the calls are angry people calling about deliveries and to complain about the way they have been treated in the stores. The management is clueless and refuses to help. Training was not good, you are put on the floor with very little training. The computer system is not well maintained and the system freezes and shuts down while in the middle of a transaction, for hours or even days. Beware, if you have any dignity and you don't like being belittled, lied to, and cussed at every day, then stay away!"
bad,The managers are poorly trained and over worked. They expect you to complete a three man job in one shift. They rather have you overworked than hire another person. The ASM for the store that I work for had no idea what she was doing and the store manager was so rude. She never had anything good to say about your work. It's not contructive criticism at all.
bad,"This company worked on a points based system, meaning employees had to receive a certain number of customer reviews and sign-ups for both credit cards and the rewards card program. However, most evenings there would be few to no customers and, as a result, most employees that worked the night shift could not make the cut for the number of sign-ups."
bad,The management I thought was old school and horrible - they only listened to their buddies and didn't care at all about the supervisors or employees - was cut throat and horrible hours and bad benefits.
bad,"I will be brief, my manager lacked basic human respect for customers  and employees alike. She was foul creature and the department was overrated and under developed."
bad,There is no job security at Sears. Upper management is so stressed about if they will be out of a job that they send that stress down to store level employees.
bad,Poor management and commission structure puts your paycheck at risk each week creates a difficult work environment. Management judges staff by numerical grade.
bad,Over worked under payed. upper management screwed up the company. Lack of communication. No training just thrown into position. Met a lot of dedicated workers.
bad,The sales aspect of this job is the true issue here. You are constantly shamed into making credit card sales by any means necessary. At times this meant sales tactics that felt forceful and dishonest given the product's contract like nature. Would not recommend to a friend.
bad,"1. Inconsistent hours"
bad,"The managers are so mean and they are always giving attitude.They blame you for everything. They don't care if you have a personal life or kids, they expect you to live for Sears. Managers are near to impossible to get ahold on the floor, training is a joke, and the only enjoyment you have is the friendships with other associates. You first come to work with a list of projects with half of them not being your job, then you wait five hours most of the time for your first break being a forced lunch, and you're lucky if you actually get a fifteen minute like you're supposed to. The management has made everyone cry at least once, guaranteed. The blame you for the store's successes and failures even if its things you can't control, especially metrics. They only care about metrics and if their beating the competition. They don't care about real customer service or how the customer feels, only wants their money. There is no employee discount, no real benefits besides paid vacation which you'll be lucky if you can get any granted to you. They don't match 401k and if you want insurance just for yourself, it'll easily cost a couple hundred every paycheck. There can be over a fo of snow on the ground and they still expect you to be to work on time."
bad,Management was very unprofessional and threatened about loosing job. They would make you look bad when it came to having things done because if you depend on them for certain task they never do them.
bad,Sears is cutting salary (commissions) and benefits dramatically in an effort to stay afloat. Advertising has been reduced to a minimum and vendor issues are causing severe shortages of inventory for sale.  The management is closing stores constantly and the public is aware of the companies struggles and this is scaring away customers.
bad,"If this Sears is counting on the store manager to keep this place open it will definitely be going out of business pretty soon!!   There's a lot of amazing employees that work their but the store Manager lack the skills, accountability, knowledge, and communication skills to be in her position.. I truly feel sorry for the people that work for her. ☹️☹️"
bad,A very stressful environment. Lots of backstabbing by co workers. No job advancement for anyone. Constant pressure to perform better and lots of stress if you don't. They do have a good training program to teach people how to sell. Or at least they used to.
bad,"The company is in serious financial trouble. They operate differently than any retail company I've ever worked for. They aren't willing to change in todays marketplace, they think the ""Sears"" way is the right way even though they are financially failing fast. The store and job are full of drama, they pick favorites who can do whatever they want and others are held to a different standard. They talk down to people and instead of showing employees they value them and they work they do they have a very ""do it or leave"" attitude. It is not a good culture to be in."
bad,"Manager was very cruel to me , very slow paced .. store was so highly priced never had a customer.depressing envirement store closed down didn't like."
bad,It's retail. No one is particularly happy to be there. Pay is low. Work is tedious. Sears/Kmart struggles to stand out in a shrinking sector. Only a matter of time before all big box stores close shop. Sears will surely be the first in that line.
bad,Lack of adaptability and underappreciation of employees is causing this corporation to fail. They are constantly removing benefits and have had a raise freeze for older employees for years.
bad,"if you're just looking for a first job, it should be alright. other than that, this place is pretty bad. managers only care about getting their bonuses, that's the reason why they're always breathing down your neck about sales and the amount of each service you sell. that's right, you have to meet a sales per hour quota, a quota on the ""big 5"" (as well as tires, batteries, and other services) and they want you to sell packages, as well as a daily/weekly/monthly sales goal. i haven't even begun to talk about the kinds of customers you get. most locations are understaffed and have quite poor management. at the one i worked at, oil changes after about 12pm would take about 3 hours to complete."
bad,Very unhappy with pay and environment. Hours were inconsistant as well as pay because it was a commission based salary with very few customers to sell to.
bad,They will hire you for a position and force you to do other's positions work and to do over time which I think is not fair at all and the metrics are very strict making you stress in and out of work.
bad,"The store has very little business, and the company policies seemed to make customers angrier, when they are supposed conveniences. That being said, the managers are fair and decent, and I enjoyed most of my co workers."
bad,"job repairing home appliances is great, managers are terrible and personally degrade you in front of peers at monthly meetings. they set you up to fail and make your job security very stressful by putting you on probation for months on end. many employees leaving company because of financial state and they don't hire replacements but instead adding more work hours to your day."
bad,first job after I graduated collage and was working there till I found a job in my career field. manager did not like it when I gave him my noticed nd was told to leave that day.
bad,"the company stopped giving raises. upper management have made the stress level very high. everyday changes did not help the company store or customer."
bad,"They treated people who gave 15 to 20 years with the compony with complete disregard and callousness. They are attempting to not pay out pensions for their staff to give large bribes to the upper management to stop them from fleeing a sinking ship. The compony is terribly run and there is no future, since they are already in bankruptcy."
bad,"In my experience, Sears wasn't the best company to work for. They don't treat workers fairly and lack humility and understanding. Management was the worst part about working for this company."
bad,"This is a company that will soon be obsolete,  so many stores closing every year. Most stores are falling apart nit only structure wise but employee wise, no pay raises ever."
bad,no family and work balance. no chance for advancement. Have to work every weekend and Holiday. Schedule changed with less than 24 hour notice. Management showed favoritism.
bad,On m'a engagée pour 5 à 10 fin de semaine  mais licencié après seulement 2 fin de semaine. Parce qu'apparament  il y aurait eu conflit entre l'agence de placement et l'agence de publicité.
bad,"The management team tries to interfere with your area, when they do not belong there. "
bad,"Sears is going down the drain. Get out while you can!"
bad,"Typical day at work, they always place me on the floor or doing other activities. I am never or rarely  in the office. I am always doing other people's job expect my own."
bad,i disliked this job i had nobody to talk to there was alone alot due to the job itself always on the go. the thing i did enjoy was early mornings at the time worked for me and i had the afternoon to mysel
bad,"I worked as an appliance repair technician and in the off season we would work in the retail department. I enjoyed the repair aspect for the most part, but when I was at the retail store the management was horrible and the workers were underpaid. Due to the pay the turnover was high and we were always understaffed especially in the warehouse. Basically you were expected to do the work of at least two people in the warehouse."
bad,"Great associates, the company advertising about the closing of the huge store has brought moral down, business is almost dead. No customers and hours of all employees are being cut back, less help"
bad,"Sears refuses to come out of the 1970's and embrace the modern age. They cater to older folks almost exclusively. That would be fine, except for the fact that so much of today's world is driven by ecommerce and younger people. The atmosphere was stressful, as supervisors pushed employees to do the ""hard sell"" on all products to all people who came in. All this while offering no commission on sales."
bad,Check my email then I walk the back room and see what needs to be done. Do we get a truck today or not. If so unload the truck with my people. Then we process it.  Help with members and the problems.
bad,"This company treats it's employees terribly.  Many employees are still working there because it used to be great and they are close to retirement.  I feel like I was treated better than many while I worked there and was paid more than some. However, the majority of employees are underpayed and overworked."
bad,"I worked for this company for a little over a year and a half and all I experienced was horrible people running the company. The managers are very corrupt and rude to their employees. They would fire employees for no reason if they didn't like them. Many of the lower level management were drug users who were rude and treated the sales associates and cashiers like trash. For cashiers, there time there is all based on up selling the Sears card. If you don't sell enough, then you will be terminated. The upper level management is incompetent and don't care much what goes on in their store. I would never work for this company again."
bad,"awful job, never want to work here again. I highy would not recommend this place, if oure looking for a warehouse job this is not the place to apply.."
bad,"Company is slowly fading away. Little to no training, it's best to have experience before applying for certain positions because they will send you out unprepaired."
bad,As a photography company there should be more time spent making sure the 'photographers' have been trained enough and have the necessary skills before they are responsible for taking someone else's pictures.  There was only two days of training.  Management at the time was very unprofessional and inconsistent.
bad,"I took the job as a challenge. Challenging it was. Sears managers never gave me the training I needed for the job. They are just as overworked as everyone else. I started out with 65-80 hours a week working 6-7 days. The list of tasks to be done by one person is truly impossible. The corporate office management is completely out of touch with what it takes each field office employee to do. Instead of changing the whole structure of operations-production, they just keep adding tasks to each person until they burn out.  There is a high turnover of all employees. The company has been on a downward spiral for over a decade. It's just time for Sears to close its doors and accept fate. Sears customers do not deserve the inferior service and materials."
bad,"The managers are terrible and are only out for themselves.  There is little to know opportunity to advance."
bad,"very bad management team and a lot of work drama. management is very rude and not understanding, shows a lot of favoritism and very poor training for job title"
bad,"Managements tend to leave customers situations on your own and when you need to get something valuable like TV's for ex and call for management to get it unlock they mostly never show up to unlock in certain amount of time for customers to pick it up. The hardest part to work is backroom associate because in MPU which is short for Merchandise Pick-Up you have to get orders for customers within five minutes. Usually when they are understaff, most of the time you would only see one employer working in that department and usually it gets very busy and end up having a lot of customers waiting to pic-up their items."
bad,I worked for Sears in Milford Connecticut as an MCA it was fun to work there met some great people but management was awful it was like re living high school again with rumors got fired for false accusations
bad,"Alot of changes happening within sears canada right now.  They are spending and have spent a fortune on ""refreshes"" none of which are getting customers to come into the stores.  First of all. ..let's deal with the customer service 1-800 joke.  As a curent employee, it is a daily battle on our end to fix what these so called customer service representatives do to our customers!  Secondly, to get a raise with sears. ....HAHAHA. ...NOT A CHANCE!"
bad,"Great place to work until they decide to ""restructure"". Restructure by their definition means fire and hire at exactly the same time with the workers being let go while the new hires sit in the same lunch room. Never in all my years working at corporate head office have I seen this type of shameful behavior."
bad,"The managers up there is so unorganized and unprofessional. When you're first hired, they act all nice and helpful. Then, when you adjust to the place, they real colors show out. Sales associates will have a maximum of 10 hours a WEEK."
bad,"Backroom/MPU"
bad,"I worked at Sears and the management was always changing. Some managers were not mature their new responsibilities and also did not teach much. They also cut employee hours and was claimed it was mandatory. I was part-time and this affected is tremendously; 3 hours per 2 weeks. There seemed to be favoritism with the seasoned employees; however, their sales numbers were usually lower than mine on a weekly bases. Very confusing."
bad,"Senior management is very inconsisitent. Job security is always up in the air. Have to ""play the game"" to get noticed and work around the clock to be even considered for a promotion. No raises, No bonuses."
bad,Very stressful environment for the day to day operations. Training is adequate but they do not provide the time to do it. Upper management has a vision for the company but they are having trouble getting the rock pushed the direction they want to go. Trying to mix two businesses in one and not dedicating the time to the brick and mortar. Co workers are some of the hardest workers and would be successful in any retail environment you put them in.
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for, the management at the Washington square store doesn't really know what they are doing and have the worst communication skills that I have ever seen. You will get told to do something by one manager and then get yelled at for doing it by another. Not to mention carts always fall over from being stacked way too high and when you say something the only thing you get told is thats what the operations manager said to do."
bad,"A sinking ship. People are good to work with."
bad,"coworkers were awful, its all about politics and people getting special treatment so make sure you kiss the bosses butt. i liked it at first til they started treating me like a dog. bosses give you dirty looks. if you want time off and request it off they will schedule you and you cant find no1 to cover, they cut your hours down and give certain people special hours."
bad,"A typical day consist of helping customers with their packages and finding merchandise in the store for online orders. The management of Sears is definitely slow. Calling a manager on duty to come open a simple cage outside the office would take 5-20 minutes. Hardest part of the job is when a single customer or multiple customer has multiple salescheck (order number) and we have to deliver their items within a 5 minute time period. The current workers that are there right now are majority a bunch of new people. Although we (the ""veterans"" of the backroom) have been constantly asking for more people to help covers shifts that way it makes it easier, took us about a year to finally employ more workers. What was worse was that they were employed just a week before Black Friday and it was a dirty mess. It is hard to enjoy the job. What is great is that there are certain down times where I am able to collect my thoughts and help review for my school work. The hard part is that I cannot do my job effectively if I am always being rushed when it is during rush hour because I am usually closing by myself. I don't mind the work no matter how hard it was because I understand how it can be. What made the work harder is that the management is not responding to the feedback we are giving to them and thus digging us into a deeper hole."
bad,Keep records of customers vehicle information and be able to thoroughly define each diagnosis. Most customers were receptive and committed to the expertise of the advisors.
bad,"This company may have been great decades ago, but unfortunately it is a juggernaut caught in its own inability to get to the 21st Century.  A company that it's only interested in taking whatever money it can from its dying customer base - most of the time at the expense of its employees."
bad,The company did not value their employees.  They would hire and fire if the employee did not meet standards.  This strict policy was not described to employee when hired however it did become apparent when they did not meet the standard.
bad,I love the people I work with. Typical day would include folding the tables and assisting customers to find a size. I have learnt how to handle aggressive customers.
bad,"A typical day at work. I clock in, using my ID. Clock out keys, count down drawer, making sure the right amount of money is in drawer. Opening safe, taking out the diamonds and putting them in the show-cast. Waiting for the manager to bring me the list to see if customers were paying off there lay-a-ways. Getting ready for the store to open. I enjoyed a few of the co-workers. The hardest part on the job was, not getting all the training that was required on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,Out of all the jobs I had I can honestly say sears was the worst. I felt like they put too much of their responsibilities on the employers. working in sears has made me feel like I never wanted to work retail again. Majority of the workers were cool optimistic people we helped each other as much as possible. The hardest part  of the job was to have to clean and monitor four sections at one time I felt like a slave working in their.
bad,Good customer work environment / good employee work staff / poor employee pay incentives / no interaction with upper divisional management staffing/ no production acknowledgement from district or national staffing
bad,"opening, closing registers, costumer service, filing, sells , the hardest part of my work day was making credit sales. the most enjoyable part of my work day was seeing all of the costumers leave happy"
bad,"The management was not very good in any department, they either did not manage enough and stayed in the background or micromanaged and practically breathed down everyone necks. They payed very little, and hired just about anyone, people who had horrible people skills and most I don't think even liked people. They unable their employees to deliver good costumer service by practically chaining them to certain areas and not allowing them to go out of their way to help others, Sears is not about costumer service at all and could care less about helping people. They encourage them to spend as little time as possible with the customers which really bothered me."
bad,I enjoyed working at Sears for the most part just because of my co-workers.  I learned that Sears as a company was going down a bad path.  I worked there for over two years and didn't get the chance for a raise.
bad,"The people at the store, for the most part, were the reason I stayed with this company as long as I did, the interaction with the customers made our day, regularly. At the end of the time we were open, there wasn't enough buisness to keep us open. The parent company decided to close My store and 2 others in our area."
bad,Assisting customers at cash wrap. What I learned was to stay away from this company at all cost. They do not care about their employees. If you don't meet your credit card quotas they cut your hours. The only positive thing about this job was my fellow co workers.
bad,"Empresa buena, compañeros de trabajo no, mi equipo me gustaba mucho por el apoyo, pero con los demás empleados no me relacionaba mucho."
bad,"A typical day for a cashier means you have to push the Sears credit cards, and the Shop Your Way points programs.  You need to get a certain amount of each per hour, or you will get into trouble with the managers.  By the time a ""member"" gets to the check out counter, they just want to pay and leave, not get bombarded with a bunch of offers."
bad,"Handled customer inquiries and needs quickly and effectively, rearranged or redressed models/store floor if required, assisted in unloading freight weekly, conducted clothing placement by following department floor plan, marketed and arranged new store items and items on sale, updated clothing racks numerous times daily, exercised time management skills."
bad,"I worked at the K-Mart in Kearny,N.J.,fellow employees are friendly for the most part.The management staff on the other hand was terrible.Even the human resource manager was terrible.They all act like,they didn't want to be bothered,when approached with a question.The pay was terrible also,lots of work required for an hourly rate under 8.00.This job should be used only as a stepping stone for bigger and better things.Or if at all possible stay away period."
bad,"If you enjoy being severely underpaid (minimum wage), while being underappreciated, and having all of your ideas completely and blatantly ignored, unless you're a commission associate, Sears is the perfect place to work. Underpaid being that you have to, as an MCA, clean the whole store, four fitting rooms, three cash wraps, hold a phone on you your entire shift taking incoming calls and doing price checks, push freight onto the floor and merchandise it, etc. There is never a lack of things to do to keep yourself busy, because even when you think the store is clean it is not, it has to be perfect. Though due to the outstanding lack of communication no one will specifically tell you what needs to be done, you're hired under the impression that you possess some kind of psychic ability. Also having your managers, store manager included, gossip to associates about who does their job and who doesn't while refusing to have that conversation with said person is among the many pros of the store. No matter what department you're in they want you to push push push the credit card applications onto everyone. Despite the fact that the company sells 1.8 billion but is in debt 4 billion they still have a really admirable sense of optimism for the years to come. They give everyone a chance, for instance, they hire managers who are immensely unqualified. They will try to fight you and persuade you outside of your availability as if you set it for fun and not a valid reason. Even if it is for school as one of the managers once said, ""School isnt important since you work longer than you'll be"
bad,"Not enough pay for what you do, I took our store to the #1 store in the region and still never got the raise that i deserved! Management doesn't care about there employee's, just all around bad place to work."
bad,Management is terrible. There's no respect from them nor any recognition for a job well done. The only two good things I can say is its easy to set up availability for when you can and cannot be there; the other is the employee discount.
bad,"Sears was once the crown jewel of the American retail industry. Since then, it has sold off several of its properties and brand names. Its CEO has divided the company into multiple divisions that are in direct competition with each other. That causes major headaches for customers when dealing with delivery and the store as neither division wants to take a negative hit that will effect the funding they receive."
bad,They are shutting down stores all over. Don't expect a raise here or any advancement.
bad,"Sears was a good place to gain retail experience. I learned about many different processes and jobs it takes in order to run a company, and how each team affects each other. The manager was awful, and unreliable, and constantly harassed/embarrassed employees. The co-workers were amazing in details, and proficient in their jobs. The hardest part was signing people up for credit cards. The most enjoyable part I found was working in my department and helping the customers."
bad,"Sears is a terrible company to work for, they don't offer raises, and the company doesn't care about its employees at all. Management preaches constantly how much they care about their ""members"" but will do NOTHING to help them out when they've been wronged."
bad,This job was exactly like being on an airplane held on the Tarmac for hours. You can get up and you can't use the bathroom because it's an active runway. This job is just like that. You just sit there. Looking outside the doors as the clouds and cars go by. You make minimum wage. Helping a bunch of Mexicans that don't deserve the service probably because of their annoying whining kids. The worst most boring job in the world.
bad,Sears cares nothing about its employees. Human resources  provide no help and only backs up management.
bad,"This was my worst job due to crazy unforeseen events that occurred i will not go into detail but to put it shortly. Suicidal Hobo, guy trying to sew me, possible kidnapping and instance of fraud   "
bad,"Working at Sears ruined my senior year of high school. Whenever there was a special event around the corner, I would take off work via the online system and submit the request to my superiors. They NEVER approved the requests because ""others already requested it off"" or ""you didn't give a big enough notice"" when I, being the organized and competent person that I am, would request the shifts off at LEAST a month in advance. I missed sporting events, a homecoming parade which I was supposed to be a part of, birthday parties, and school events. When it came to prom and graduation events (YES GRADUATION) they still told me no. When I was given the ultimatum of prom or keeping my job, I quit on the spot. I don't regret it either. I did however learn a lot as far as managing money and helping customers goes."
bad,"I currently work for Sears Holdings/Kmart. I am required to maintain multiple departments at the same time, however I am paid just slightly above minimum wage. I have to maintain the electronics, layaway, toy, automotive, and home repair departments in an average day at work. This requires going back and forth between the departments, pulling layaways, storing layaways, cleaning departments and servicing customers at a rate of $7.75 per hour and have been informed that there is no prospect for a raise. Employees have been there over 2 years and are at the same rate of pay as the day they started. The company requires you to go above and beyond the call of duty but will not compensate you for your efforts."
bad,"Answering Inbound- calls, data entry, scheduling appointments payments, dispatching, filing and faxing."
bad,"do not work here!  This is a very horrible company.  They treat their employees poorly, and expect you to live at work."
bad,management is really bad at this company. If you get busy and its time for you to go home you have to stay.If you get busy you dont get breaks.
bad,"Working at Sears was pretty horrible. Technology is incredibly outdated, a simple return can take upwards of 15 minutes because of all the steps you need to take. The constant badgering about credit card apps is disheartening and annoying. Hard to get people to sign up when the benefits are minimal and the risk is high since the interest rate is absurd. Add this on top of a very poor product offering an I am not surprised the company is going under."
bad,"Very friendly co-workers and management is OK, but the pay is very low and the incentives are not that much. Only apply for this job if you're unemployed. You'll still be looking if you are hired. Once you see the way the metrics are changed so often to keep you making on average $9.00 hr for 30-35 hrs a week, you'll want to find better. Good job for kids out of high school, but not for someone whose trying to take care of kids. Very few growth opportunities. Out of the 20 people who were hired with me, only one is left. Thats within a 3 month period. Very high turnover ratio."
bad,"this job could have been alot better but the pay is very low.. and its not light work.. the environment was okay, bc the residents were worth the while"
bad,Count cash drawers. I learned a lot about retail since it was my first retail job. The management wasn't all that good to their employees. My co workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was applying customers for a sears credit card. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and interacting with customers.
bad,"For minimum wage its horrible. They pressure you to get a certain amount of credit card apps and the commission off that is like 2$. Then management themselves need improvement. Especially if its the one in Newark,Ca. If you are in sales you make good money I heard. Maybe then its an OK. Job."
bad,during my time at sear i receive unfair treatment when it came down to the hours given i also was not treat properly compared to some of the other workers. Management was poor. hardest part of the job was overseeing other job duties. i learned how to begin work in a small level warehouse type setting.
bad,"Supporting management and associates."
bad,"Sears is customer service focused, but they turn the customers off by trying to push too many extras on them such as rewards card, credit card, extended warranties. These are things the customer may like to sign up for but we are told to be aggressive and the customer does not like this. we are written up if we dont make quota"
bad,"Honestly though the management was very unprofessional and slacking at Sears, the total experience wasn't bad because I had a good time dealing with the customers and my co workers! Usually at work I would walk in, clock in and greet my co workers, then head straight to my cashwrap and begin opening my drawers. Then I would help set up the stores until my first customers comes in! The hardest part of working at sears was the everyday hounding of convincing our customers to sign up for a credit card. Everyday we were harassed about the sales of the credit! But the best part was the social interaction between my co-workers and the customers."
bad,"A typical day at work involved arriving to my office which my team and I had to paint ourselves, or figuring out how to rig our camera system to work without the assistance of the vendor, because any expense over $500 had to be approved by corporate. If the cameras worked, we were burdened with extremely high target goals for internal and external apprehensions. The conditions of the stores was deplorable. My District Manager actually had two districts, one in Northern Virginia and one in Southern North Carolina and we rarely spoke. The technology was outdated to say the best. The training was non existent. We spent weeks at a time in other stores cleaning and building electronics cages for expensive merchandise, while still being held accountable for performance at the store.  The experience is not one I will soon forget, and not for anything positive. When my son was born, I was called while still in the hospital and informed that I would need to open the store the next morning, despite being on Paid Time Off. As a manager you are paid on the 15th and 30th every month, instead of biweekly, may not seem like much, but it makes a difference."
bad,"The good: Great location (Eaton Centre).  Work-life balance is great.  Employee discounts on merchandise.  "
bad,Management was bad did not give good direction and was not a joy to work with. Your days were long. You did not have a good idea how long you would be there due to fact that it is retail and the job has alot to it.
bad,"Horrible company, unorganized, unethical . They stress out their workers to get credits and will fire you in days if your not up to standards."
bad,"Ive been at Sears for 5 years NO raise, NO promotion, Benefits suck  "
bad,This job is alright for teenagers who are just passing through. I wouldn't recommend anyone to keep this job as their life long career unless they have nothing greater in their minds. I can't say that all Sears are bad because that would be a false statement but what I can say that my Sears was horrible. Certain polices and cultural beliefs of the company are stupid; they want you to do so much for them but aren't willing to pay you for your hard work and effort.
bad,"A typical day started with checking in with the managers and staying at your cashier station until breaks and quitting time, by yourself, and hoping for the rare customer to come along.  I didn't learn much.  It was the dullest job I've ever had.  Co-workers were boring and not very helpful.  Hardest part of the job was coming in every day, busting your butt, for minimum wage.  The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting."
bad,A typical day was to assist customers with their purchases and to answer any questions or concerns they may have. Co-workers were great people who would go out of their way to help if there was a problem or if i was confused about something. Unfortunately never saw any support from management who were more interested with how many credit card applications and Shop Your Way Rewards sign-ups had been done.  Training was a joke as I was shown how to do my job by another cashier. 
bad,"Typical retail practices from the dark ages, most of the people who work at Sears have been there for 15+ years and have a very complacent attitude toward their jobs.  There were some genuinely great people who picked up everyone else's slack.  "
bad,"Not appreciated. Always feeling pressure , Sales, Credit, "
bad,Working for Sears it's an OK job for temporary. They pressure you to get customers to apply for a credit card. You don't get  lots of hours if you're not that good with getting credit apps and signing the up for the free shop your ways rewards program. The management have their favorite picks.
bad,Typical day was waiting for any customer to walk in then try and convince them to buy a warranty because that's where the money is
bad,No raises company will cut hours at the drop of a dime does not matter if your store is number one in the district or how much money you make them they still are not satisfy they are greedy and dont care about employee
bad,Not an employee friendly workplace. Bullying and intimidation were common managerial tools. Not his way when I started...but over 4 years it became increasingly worse. Really liked it at the start.
bad,"Store was in disarray when I took this position. I was promised to have assistance from a District Manager and a Multi-unit manager. I received neither. I was not given any managerial training at all. Overall vision in company seems lost. Unwillingness to conform in newer practices, Money not well spent in store modifications."
bad,"The lack safety standards made injury not just likely, but almost inevitable. The managements concern was monetary and not moral or employee based. I found that working there put my health and well being at risk. The pay was at minimum wage and did not match the risk and labor involved. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"For the most part the management played the ""favorites"" game. Whoever they liked most usually got the most hours. I was always hard working and on time. Not only did I meet the sales goals and requirements but I exceeded them and still got my hours cut."
bad,"The workers there were very enjoyable and proficient. the management was very terrible about handling certain situations, many of those with customers. Instead of hiring more mca's for stocking and signing they hired more register and sales associates. who apparently disappeared or were not on schedule which lead to long lines and wait; where me and other mca's had to step in after pausing our own work. Its only understandable to be a team but a lot of things could have been better. The leads of every area left , as once again the manager of the store resigned.The whole communication and computer network was running windows nt which caused many issues such as the network being done for weeks.You are supposedly paid for every hour of work after calculating hours an refund amount things do not add up. The overall workplace and business experience was plan grotesque. Over worked and under paid with bad management should be there slogan. the customers were very nice and tried being understanding."
bad,"Management worried about nothing but numbers. You could be throwing up in the middle of the store and they would probably hold your hair while they continue to harrass you about store goals. They would work around your schedule as long as they complained about it the whole time.. Co workers are very nice and helpful. The HR was team was amazing. I loved working with them. Their attendance policy is rediculous. 24 hour advance warning of a call in?! and some dr notes aren't excused. Departments were combined and we weren't able to pull up progress reports and the management would do monthly ""meetings"" about how you were doing but never give you full info because they couldn't pull it up either."
bad,Consultative
bad,"This job is literally the easiest job I've ever had, but the company will make it as difficult as possible with their pointless rules. They hire the most incompetent people I've ever seen, management included!! On top of that management talks at you and not to you, will put you down, and not give you guidance on how to improve, but everything you do is wrong, but I've witnessed even management fail miserably at doing associates jobs. If your in between jobs and your looking for something quick, but this is not a place that you should stay for very long."
bad,"I do my best work as always, but I do not agree with some of the new management ideas and values."
bad,Sears Marketing Company is a very okay place to work if you are a college student
bad,"Company has no loyalty to their employees. When it comes to problems they sweep them under the rug. To cover them from law suites, they have you sign that you will not sue. I've seen loyal employees laid off just to save payroll. And payroll freeze. Thetes people that need to work and after years are still working for min wage. Schedules are really a joke. They are not posted till Fridays for Sunday. Then they pencil in what management want you to work. SAnd theres hardly ever an 8 hr shift given. They would rather give you a shift of 11 AM to 5PM just to keep you from finding another job"
bad,"I knew, on my second day, I was not going to be around for a very long time. The person responsible for my training had just been demoted from the position that she was to train me for. She was bitter and she told me that she could not train me because she was told that she did not perform job to store expectations. How could she train me? I spoke to the HR lead and I was told that this person may train me with wrong procedures or show me steps that were incorrect. I was having a very difficult time trying to figure out the procedures for any of my assigned duties. I was yelled at, on numerous occasions, for not learning the job quickly enough. I was yelled at for not doing the job quickly enough. I watched the dynamics around the store and noticed that many people get yelled at so this was a normal management style for the store. Raise your voice, intimidate and CYA seem to be management techniques taught at Sears Schools. My immediate supervisor was only concerned about the manager yelling at her so I needed to learn my job so she would not be yelled at. I reminded her that no one was training me but she said I was not learning fast enough???? Two weeks had gone by, since I was hired, and I still was not being properly trained so I felt I had no option but to resign."
bad,"Overall, the employees are great to work with, the management needs to be more ""employee oriented""."
bad,I liked my job but the people that I worked with made it where I didn't like coming into work
bad,this place is a decent place to work tho it has the same problems as other retailers but the benefits is a lot better.
bad,"I had to do mostly customer service and paper work when people came to pic up merchandise. Inventory also if I had to work in ""the cage"" where small electronics were bought by customers."
bad,"I worked for this company in A SEARS FLS for awhile. Every time an issue was brought to management's attention, they would do nothing about it. They often played favorites to those not following the rules, because they were able to bring our store up in sales. Every person I had worked with has since quit or been fired for doing their jobs. HIGH TURN OVER RATE."
bad,poor enviroment bad management nothing but hard greasy work.
bad,"When the core values changed from "" A great place to shop,work and invest"" to ""make more money"" everything went downhill, sales, profits, employee morale. That crushed the culture, morale and hence the sales."
bad,The training is good and useful as long as you can retain all the information you learn in a week the work life balance in the first two months of work are none existenance. Long hours with minimal Overtime
bad,"This place is a dive.  The cash registers are from the 60s, slow and always breaking down.  The store is dusty and the bathrooms beyond deplorable.  Management is non-existent and clueless.  I was treated differently because of my ethnicity by many employees of another ethnicity. It is a good thing this place will be out of business in a few weeks."
bad,"Due to recent bankruptcy and continued financial constraints, I would not recommend employment with this company. There is a tremendous amount of stress related to bringing customers back into the store and overcoming their negative attitudes about the company,"
bad,The managers sucked. The place sucked. The pay sucked didn't get a raise in years. If You needed help to get merchandise know body would help you.  This place Sucks sucks.
bad,It started out great to be able to build a good start in your career but there is too much hostility between managers and employees. They have diversity however some of the managers there find a way to nit pick at everything an employee of color does. They also will purposely try to make you feel unwelcome and try to work you like an animal during the holiday times. I have worked retail during 4th quarter before and never felt so unprepared as I felt at Sears. Not worth staying at which was why I left.
bad,"When I was working for them part time, it was most definitely poorly managed. Department leads were doing most, if not all, the managing. My co-workers were always kind and willing to lend a hand to anyone else, even if they weren't in the same department. Got to know them a lot better than my managers, that much I'm certain on."
bad,"Managers are nice however the company sucks. All they care about is metrics, so if you dont get people to apply for the credit card you get no hours. Most people dont want to sign up for a credit card when they think the store is going out of business. Sometimes you might have absolutely no hours scheduled for the week. Ultimately the job is not worth having if you actually need money."
bad,"Was a stressful and friendly work environment,managers stucks... Would not recommend anyone working here unless you're desperate. If you're looking for a job that gives 3hr shifts then this is the place for you."
bad,It was very poorly ran they broke the law by letting illegal people who are not eligible to work come in and work and take your job make you make less an hour I was not very friendly all the construction got cussed and screamed at on a daily basis your work tradesmen ship was not treated like it should have been.
bad,Just another sales job. Management is usually horrible and extremely unprofessional in retail stores. Appliance associates is full commission plus draw with no base pay. Only good thing I guess is that hours are flexible.
bad,Working at Sears Outlet was a very good experience to learn about the environment I was working in. The store it’s self was a great place to buy appliances. The management was a total wreck.
bad,The managers did a lot of favoritism with each other and employers. Very toxic and childish place to work with very very low pay. Schedule was also based on that
bad,No chance for advancement and not enough pay or hours to make it worth working. Managers didn't want to help when things were needed causing the cashiers stress and mad customers
bad,The overturn rate is very high and they do not appreciate their employees. Any little thing they write you up for and if you can not reach your quota in credit cards then this is definitely not a place for you.
bad,"Learned a lot from Sears, they really trained us well. Unfortunately there may not be a Sears company to work for in a few years. Its a shame because its an important part of American Retail History."
bad,"First position as a store manager. I was first offered another store and then they changed it, I was then told I would have more employees and did not receive them. I worked long hours due to the lack of help needed to run the store. I was left with over 5 years of past medical records that should have been destroyed and I was left with a year and half worth of medical insurance claims. There was just myself and one other employee. I worked usually double my shift just to stay afloat with the regular job duties and then the other stuff they piled on me."
bad,"On an average shift I spent cataloging merchandise in the backrooms of the store with an occasional customer merchandise pickup. The customer merchandise can be very stressful. During the holidays, the stress is 100 times worse."
bad,This is the worst company I've ever worked for. No raises but they work you to death.  They expect you to do all these other jobs that you weren't hired for but with no raise. Dont ever work this company.
bad,"Customer service was great and helping people get the right tools etc  love all the new updated equipment, tools,etc and we had the first opportunity to explore products etc."
bad,IT staff continues to be cut to the bone as Sears sinks further to the bottom of the retail world.  Management is a revolving door and takes no responsibility for poor business decisions.
bad,"Sears Holdings is caught in a downward spiral. Their rich heritage is being obscured by the rise of Internet shopping. Too much emphasis was placed upon real estate holdings and anchor mall tenancy. And by the time that Sears acknowledged this, their competitive position had been compromised. Sears is a good place to work. But the company seems caught in its past rather than propelled into the future."
bad,"Not much good to say about Sears."
bad,the pay is not worth it at all you can not make a living off what they offer the managment is ok but I wouldn't go back the workers that have been there for years have a bad attitude
bad,"Many jobs with in my job and not enough pay, for all the roles taken care of , managers put everything on cashiers and do very little , there mood affects everyone else"
bad,Sears had a major culture problem due to it's business solvency issues.  Old school management and fear tactics was the norm.  It is not a surprise this company has folded.
bad,"Great company and great managers and associates, but no growth or benefits. Very little hours and no appreciation for employees. No incentives or discounts."
bad,It was super boring because people did not come into shop but the co workers were good. The pay was trash below minimum wage at this point. The job was easy just extremely boring!
bad,"I worked at Sears for 10 years.  During my time there I found it stressful and a very negative experience."
bad,They killed an amazing business.  This used to be a company that everyone could trust.  It slipped away because of an owner that no longer wanted a business...just the money.
bad,"Sears is slowly but surely dying due to their inability to effectively focus on outstanding customer service. The bottom line is their most important goal and squeezing employees, customers and vendors into more for less in the strategy to reach that goal. In my opinion, it won't work."
bad,Sears was my only job. I worked there for a total of 30 years. I still made minimum wage when the company went bankrupt. the store was dirty and falling apart.
bad,"The company itself is on a downward spiral. For the first couple of months working there I didn't have a direct manager. Aside from one to two managers, the leadership was lacking."
bad,"This place is the worst job I have ever had, hours are terrible would work 3 hours a week yes I said it 3 HOURS a week sometimes 4 if I was lucky,seems like they had there fair share of favorites, management is terrible there, everybody always gossiping about others. Not enough workers to help other workers. And customer service is S##ty"
bad,"A typical day at Sears is demanding from management to pleasing disgruntled customers.  Depending on the management team there were times when I had wonderful support, then others times I had very little or any support from management. Selling large appliances is a cut throat business that requires thick skin. I enjoyed selling the appliances and working with people by insuring they purchased what they were looking for, I did not appreciate some of the associates stealing my sales and management allowing it happen."
bad,"When I first started it was great, I learned a lot. The management was great as were my co-workers I actually enjoyed my job. Then everything changed. Management turn-over is unreal. Forget about job/life balance their is none. Hours were cut even though there was hardly any employees left. There is no job security since they are laying off people left and right. Stores are closing everywhere."
bad,"Sears, has and had great managers. It looks tough for the future of Sears. The company is loosing the back bone that made Sears great. I personally enjoyed my job, and the people I hired; and worked with."
bad,"It's all about numbers, productivity, cutting hours, and it gets harder every year. Punch in, get to work, 15 min break, back to work, 30 min unpaid lunch, back to work, 15min break, back to work, as soon as you throw the last box you better get punched out. Better not stop to talk to anyone or your productivity suffers and you'll be written up or fired. Starting pay is nice but they don't raise the top. Good raises in the beginning and no raises after a few years."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job. Though it was seasonal, I felt like no one liked working there. I didn't feel like the management cared about us and they pressured us hard to do certain tasks like get credit card applications. I was there to do a cashier job and I didn't expect such pressure. The job itself was enjoyable but it was hard to do with the stress of needing to get credit applications."
bad,"This company is falling apart. The equipment, racks, management; everything there just sucks. Such an embarrassment. It's only a matter of time before the company goes under."
bad,I learned little to nothing at this job but it was a good place holder during college since it wasn't stressful at all. Just other college students doing the same thing. Turnover was extremely high.
bad,"The work environment itself isn't all bad, as coworkers can be very enjoyable to work with. Budget is very low in the company on the verge of going under, so it is hard to get the tools needed to do the job correctly. The number of employees in the store is too few, stretched too thin to do too many tasks. Supplies are not given in timely fashion or sometimes at all (we had a broken AC unit for years) . Customers can be very hard to deal with at times, other times can be a positive experience."
bad,"Coworkers were great till they started pushing all the hard-working good employees  out the door  and closing other stores that's when I discovered that they take Managers from the failing stores and push them into the successful ones very little room to advance upward "
bad,"Don't work for this company.  It will be completely gone soon. CEO is a very bad, greedy man. Destroyed Kmart and misled at every turn. On your feet some days for 12 hour.  Out of date in every way."
bad,I wouldn't recommend Sears Automotive to any of friends or contacts as a place to work. A typical day at work for sears can very one week you will be busy an other there hardly be in customer coming in.
bad,There is a lack of communication and no room for advancement which is why many people move on .There is no raises which is also a big factor of why people leave as well.
bad,listening to agents take calls and receiving calls as well. upper management was never there for coaching just typically at the end of the month if numbers were not meant
bad,Sears is a sinking ship.  Poor leadership at the top who does not have a vision on where to take the company or how to make it succeed.  As the company is fallen apart and nearing bankruptcy the culture has become very threatening.
bad,"There was only one good thing about that job and it was my manager. Everything else was horrible There is fierce competition to open credit cards, which you were paid to open, but you constantly fought with coworkers over it. It was a lot of drama and gossip and it just wasnt worth minimum wage."
bad,"i hated working in sears. i was a builder. my job was to assemble the bikes, grills, stoves, etc for customers & display purposes. the hours were long, and sometimes you'd have a list of 50+ different items to build within 2-3 days. honestly speaking if i wasn't being paid minimum wage (7.25 at the time) and actually had someone to help me, or at least another builder it probably wouldn't  be all bad"
bad,"Sears Holdings Corp is in a slow death spiral. Poor leadership and haphazard vision is killing the company. The CEO is liquidating the company. Everyone sees it, but it's an ""Emperor has no clothes"" situation."
bad,It was horrible and store manager let the whole staff do whatever they want.and they would schedule you when they wanted and were nit able to take breaks when you were alone. No double coverage.
bad,"Responsible for 40 stores as far as scheduled maintenance and emergency repairs.  "
bad,"a normal would include cleaning the floor making sure freight was put away and assisting customers. some management were good some not so good. I learned how to multi task and train new hires when needed, the most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they were looking for."
bad,"This company is not a good company, the pay commission is not good, the structure of their company is not good . that hardest part of the job is to get people to walk into the store, how to drive traffic. there is no way to drive traffic everything was brought in by the company"
bad,As SEARS Canada filed for bankruptcy protection I feel that there is no need to do a review for this company.  If Disney land is the happiest place on earth working for SEARS Canada would be the opposite end of the spectrum
bad,"With all of the layoffs and reductions, it is not a fun place to work. We are all doing the work of 4-5 people"
bad,"I have worked for Sears for 10 years. When I first started the job, sales were frequent, the money was good, and I had managers and co-workers that I got along well with. As time went on, the company as a whole continued to get worse and worse. Upper management, people whom I've never met, would continue to take away more and more commissions, and continued to demand more and more from it's employees. Mandatory meetings for those who did not meet their quotes continued to develop, yet education of the job as a whole did not increase. Eventually, my department was dismantled in an effort to save money. As new managers came in to replace old ones, it became obvious that the general care for it's employees left with the benefits they once provided. Considering the financial situation of the company as a whole, I would not recommend working for this company in any position at this time."
bad,I went to work at Sears unsure of what working in retail would be like. I was pleased at the professionalism of the management team in the local store. I saw though that the corporate office was the issue most of the time. Some antiquated policies needed to go.
bad,"The company has benefits and downers, me and my gf both worked for the company and were fired for petty reasons as well as a friend we refered to the company all three of us were fired in less the 4 months. And weve all held professional jobs in past Sears is to big of a company to care about there employees.Wile bosses walets get fatt they only worry about there bank account. Employees are hired and quickly fired."
bad,This company is dying. This company is dying. Do not consider a career here because you will be out of a job in the next year or so. Did I mention company is dying?
bad,"No training. Will put you in positions and you have no say in the matter, you will work where they want you or else they will tell you to leave. Set you up for failure. Equipment is garbage but yet you have to get your job done. Associates are miserable and management is always fighting with one another and this reflects on the associates out on the salesfloor. Good coworkers but lousy management team! Store is always hot, 💯 degrees because AC has been broken for years. Give them 100% but this is never good enough!"
bad,I started working & everything was good I really like this job but many managers have been quitting so we get new ones. Also i only get 4-8 hrs a week.
bad,This just was similar to telemarketing sales. Many of the customers would become irate because they already refused the protection agreements in the store.
bad,"Not a great work environment, not enough sales for good commission pay, management shows favoritism in scheduling. Softlines are overworked hardlines are commissioned and don't end up doing much of anything."
bad,Working for this company was the worst experience of my life. You can work as hard as youd like but without the right friends in the right places you are nothing. You cant move up and there is no way of getting promoted here unless your direct supervisor recommends you.
bad,A typical day was working on the floor doing price changes and organizing racks.  Everyone seemed to have a chip on their shoulder. I learned a lot about staging and processing.
bad,Didn't like to work here because the management was rude.Hours were really bad.They never showed you what to do if you were new they would let someone else to help you.
bad,"the store baarely had business, the manager is very rude and the store manager talked to you reckless as well, i use to like my job until i was there for a year and realized the real people"
bad,The managemant overall could use a lot of work. Employees are great for the most part.The most difficult part is keeping up with the metrics. The most enjoyable part is the customer base.
bad,I only worked here because there were no other jobs available. Management acted like children. No body got trained properly. Employees got yelled at for not doing there job because no-one told them what their job actually was.
bad,a typical day at work was coming in and rushing to get out and start deliveries. management wanted you to do deliveries even when it was unsafe to do so.
bad,"Extremely competitive job, must be experienced in using MS DOS mode. Bit of a downer I thought. Some staff at customer service are very unprofessional, swearing and a bit self righteous, not very good trainers. Customers were always great and I find always knew what they wanted and what price they were looking for. All very patient when times were busy."
bad,"Not much to say, horrible management. They wanted you to do more than you had the tools for. Managers and leads didn't know what was going on and didn't know needed resources. Everything is based on surveys. They have a mattress return policy that is strict which you would get a bad survey for but they'd still blame you even though the comments were about the policy. The catch is that they were not informed before the connected call about the survey NOR were we allowed to tell them. Saw too many good agents being fired for this. I would not work here, they are a horrible company. The only reasons why I gave 5 stars on job work/life balance is because you can almost take off WHENEVER YOU WANT BUT IT'S NOT PAID. They have a good absent policy. They work well with school and life schedules. If that's all you need then this is the place for you."
bad,"Pay is a problem... Nice place to work, but cheap pay. Coworkers are teamplayers and assists when needed. Although, it can be very busy, need more employees. Theft is a big problem and dangerous to all workers. Nice employee discount, especially for the Holidays."
bad,"The worst working experience ever."
bad,focus always is on the negative on what you did bad on the good things are over lookr=ed most of the time and people are not treated equally everyone is mad all the time i feel
bad,"A typical day at work (sears) was always stressful but nothing hard to handle. I learned how to make international phone calls dealing with customers accounts and making sure I help them in every way possible. Management could have been better at being professional but that did not steer me away from handling my day to day responsibilities. I really enjoyed working with my peers, we had a lot of great ideas together to make our sales better. I would say the hardest part about working with sears is the last minute changes we had to make with our customers on our sale prices. At the end of the day the most enjoyable part about the job is dealing with different people and giving them good customer service! ."
bad,Improved 100% company customer service with my experience and psychology. Without technician training every day its a big challenge. The company goals its optimize the sales contract between customer repair needs in 35 to 45 min. In my personal experience 85% the morning service its walking distance (2 miles) without work vehicle. That's because a work order destination its in the only old town in the nation with out parking place. Learn a lot about how to fix any appliance with the minimum time and minimum expense possible.
bad,"Terrible Store and District management no communication ,no assistance or way to grow .Management plays favorites with salespeople and Also hours. No Labor laws are followed but documented as they are"
bad,Worst experience i've ever had working for a company. Experienced nothing but harrassment and abuse from management and coworkers.
bad,For the amount of work they expect to receive from you the pay does not equal to that amount. You can move up quickly in the company only if your well like by management and have no problem with loosing your own identity to conform to the beliefs of the manager in charge.
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for, but the people/co-workers make it somewhat worth it. No raise for employees going on 8 years and counting. Poor mid-level and upper level management. The job is okay for a few extra bucks, but advancement opportunities are non-existent. Future of company is very bleak."
bad,"-Very slow "
bad,"Management is consistently belittled due to downward sales goals and negative reviews. This lead to belittling of employees from management, making the overall atmosphere very negative and unpleasant."
bad,"I worked with nothing but drunks and drug addicts. The starting pay was awful with the experience I had at the time. I liked the hours though, which were 7-3 Monday through Friday."
bad,My employment at Sears was the worst experience of my professional career.  Poor leadership and little to no training on how to operate the company's stone age process.  There is a clear reason why this company will not last in a ever-changing retail market...The company is drowning in the sea-of-sameness...
bad,"The only thing that was great about this job was the commission. The management team goes above and beyond to get you fired. Even If you're 1 minute late they put you on a ""plan"""
bad,Worst company to work for. Management was so bad very unprofessional. Managers was very racist. The manager drove everyone out of there.
bad,Lots of cash handling and dealing with angry customers. They are always pushing for shop your way rewards and credit applications making the job stressful
bad,This is an awful place to work.  No support from upper management. Not willing to hire qualified techs. Not allowed to fire the morons that were hired. Let Sears close. Don't work there.
bad,"The only positive thing in this position is the fast money, that is if it stays on the books.  There is no life work balance.  You are always gone.  You never know where you are going until the morning of. You can never schedule family activities or functions because you are primarily always on call.  The training is inadequate for what you do in the field.  A lot of driving, wear and tear on your vehicle and hours spent without any compensation.  Another problem is safety.  You are going to appointments, alone, within a 2 hour driving radius from your home to a strangers home.  There are to many uncertainties with this position.  Management was very helpful, but only if you were a good producer.  The stress with this position is ridiculous."
bad,I used to shop at Sears for everything.  After working there and not being able to assist the customers properly.  Some Customer had a Range and the cost for the warranty was expensive and when the customers range broke still under warranty the Range still being made were sorry we don't carry that part anymore.
bad,"Needs a clear leader that will stay with the company longer then 3 or 4 months. I am on my 9th boss in 3,5 years. Needs to get more employees and more inventory."
bad,"a typical day at work is cash handling and customer service"
bad,"No growth with this company, this is not a place that you want to get comfortable with. No raises in eight years! District Managers are very unprofessional."
bad,"A day at work typically consisted of maintaining cheer and handling customers to their satisfaction, often working alone at a station of four registers. I learned how to manage the intercom system and call for assistance when necessary. I learned the layout of the store and the details of care packages that came with certain products of the store, as well as the details of company credit and rewards cards offered at the time. I learned much while working alongside my coworkers, such as whom I could trust to adequately assist me with any procedures I did not understand or was unsure of, and their interests, hobbies, and lives outside of the workplace. We came to love each other as a family and I enjoyed working alongside them all so, so much. Their smiles and company were a big part in why I looked forward to working my shifts."
bad,"Phone calls all day, two breaks and one lunch. Management was somewhat helpful about scheduling. Problems with some favoritism and there were multiple reports about that. If there was anything that needed to be fixed, it is that."
bad,It felt like I had little time to complete daily tasks due to the shear amount of micro - management. Couple that with the nasty emails and the failing business model made it the perfect storm.  Had to work 3 weekends a month versus the 2 stipulated at employment. Poor training program. Don't waste your time!
bad,"Horrible organization, ridiculous expectations, and RUDE management. I continue to work here ONLY because of the pay (which is only good on commission and god forbid a slow season)"
bad,"Manager and owner sucked @ running a business, and were always off playing golf together, leaveing me short on helping customers and other task around the store."
bad,"A young woman was hired as a Cashier. Shortly afterwards she was promoted into Mgmt. She would socialize from Register-to-Register. Customers' would be waiting for transactions that required Mgr. overrides and the person who often was set up to respond literally sometimes just did not come amidst she was called up to several times. She was taking double breaks to feed her baby amidst she had just taken her break. She would hang out in the office sitting on desks sprawled out or with her husband. When she did come, for Code 2's, Code 4's, Code 3's, she was so unfit (extremely large person) it would take her a while (double time) to get to the Register. It was awful there since she was hired. Sears also dumps people for the smallest of thing and there was a high turn over. I am glad that I am not at Sears. I like my previous and later Retail jobs much more!!! Also, Reviews would occur, a raise would be merited according to points on the review, to then hear that, ""There was no money from Corporate to give raises."" Therefore, raises were long over due that were already otherwise merited, eligible, and approved."
bad,"I am required to work 11 hour days with no lunch, no opportunity to see my family unless after dark.  Upper management ask for task that take me away from making more money for the company to do task that I have repeated at least four times."
bad,Extremly poor managent and work ethic of the full-time staff is extremly poor as well.
bad,"To start off the work environment was great. There was no proper training, and the managers expect you to know their systems and how they work. I felt like I was always thrown out there with no guidance or training what so ever. The pay is horrible, I was there years and never saw a raise. There is no opportunity to advance in the company. Management made things very akward for the associates, the would always go against one another. I guess there was an authority issue, they all wanted to be top dog. I wouldn't reccommend this place, but if you are in need just be prepared for feeling overworked and under paid."
bad,"Sears had a really unorganized work atmosphere. They ran low on cashiers and sales associates, causing customers to frustrate and either leave or take it out on the employees. Aside from management, I had a great manager that really encouraged all the cashiers. The job was not difficult. I was good with interacting with customers and satisfying them at the end of their purchase."
bad,"Very little commission offered, 1-3%. They pay you as little as they legally can, and expect you to do more than you are paid to do."
bad,"There's a lot of sale stealing from other co-workers, everyone tries to tell you how to do your job fifteen different ways and you have to tell your own co-workers to back off, that they are the same pay grade as you. "
bad,"This is a great place to work for compensation and benefits however the culture, atmosphere, and environment were terrible."
bad,I loved my manager. She was the coolest. My co workers were cool also. I enjoyed helping my customers.
bad,This is a place to work for someone who doesn't have major responsibilites.
bad,"The management were awful, they treated the people I worked with and myself terribly just because we were back dock associates, while every worker on the floor was treated the best"
bad,"The hardest part of the day is sitting down and not recieving any phone calls"
bad,"Opening cashier , receive customer , new merchandise learning , verify promotion , prepare schedule for employee , check old merchandise report and inventory, order merc handise , resolve customer and coworweker problems. I learned the customer first above all. The hardest part of the job when we lost a customer . And the most enjoyable part when we give a good service"
bad,The pay is horriable for the amount of work you have to do. Not given enough hours
bad,"I have been with Sears for only 3 1/2 years. I work full time on commission selling Appliances. Even though my sales have increased each year (the first year I was part time) my commission has decreased each year. It is very hard to get the most simple things done. Too many departments with too many chiefs and outside contractors. This may have been a great place to work at one time, however with the all the changes and low pay now, I would not recomend this job to anyone."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that has a family to provide for.
bad,"Worked there for over 5 years. In the last 18 months its all been a snowball. Constant writeups for things that are not control of the associate. Push the metrics but do nothing to get the customer(Member) in the door. Upper management is at such a disconnect its unreal. They think if its on paper in black and white then that is the reality. They take no consideration for whats actually happening in the store. Give you one set of numbers to meet, then change it a short time later. Its never good enough."
bad,"Sears at one time WAS a good company to work for and shop not so much anymore."
bad,They are on a pay freeze and have been for years. Management is awful starting from the very top. They don't care about their employees. They just want to see the numbers.
bad,"I hated everything about this job for the 6 months I worked there. Typical day at work was sitting in a dirty cubicle on a slow computer all day taking 60+ calls with no breaks. If you had an escalated call with a typical rude customer needing to speak with a manager, good luck getting a manager on the phone better yet good luck finding one on the call floor. If someone calls and just hangs up, it drops your numbers. You have to offer way too much stuff on every call and obtain way too much information. Pay is 10.50/hr then after 6 months or whenever you decide before the 6 months you go to 9.45/hr plus commission. Good pay but you honestly deal with wayyyy too much stress from customers. If you can get paid to be disrespected all day this is the job for you. Management micromanages everything. You get counted off if your quiet more than 10 seconds on a call. And don't go to the bathroom too long they'll be calling your manager to see where you went. Most enjoyable part of the job was quitting!!!"
bad,Managed a team of 25 Data Entry associates.  Monitored and provided feed back on a timely basis
bad,senior leadership is seriously lacking a moral compass. Abuse of employees occurred on a regular basis and formal complaints were covered up and local HR was excluded from the process. Voluntary turnover among management was 70% in a 12 month period. This is not a company who values loyalty and the hard work of its people.
bad,IF you eally need this job get it and immidiatly get another one and quit this is the worst place to work!!!! if u happen to actually make it there a long time they will fire u for any reason. I was there for 11 months and right before I hit a year LP grabbed me and said they found me makin up e-mail addresses and I said whatever i idid not do that and I was really upset so I said either fire me or I will get back to work for 8.00 an hour that is really humiliating geting led to the back of the store. so they had me write on a peice of paper watever we talked about and weeks later they hired someone else had me train them and than they fired me for creating fake e-mail addresses luckily in the mean time I was already looking and found something a lot better. So my advice get out and find something better there arent many sears around and luckily a lot of ppl dont shop there so hopefully the sears name will just fade away and just be a bad dream that u dont remeber haaha
bad,"Its quite boring,if you dont get customers to sign up for an sears account,they will transfer you to a different department,the benefits are good.they write you up behind small things,they are slow to promote,the cashier lead is rasict,she talks to the employees any kind of way.its always hot in that place."
bad,"A day at work for the most part would be boring. I've learned to be more patient with customers and co workers, there is a lot of miss communication with management from all of Sears. Some of my co-workers would call out of their shifts which didn't help considering we were short on staff which left a burden for the one's that were there each day. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers and dealing with the summer heat with the air conditioning turned on low. The e most enjoyable part of the days were the breaks i would get."
bad,"Ring transactions"
bad,I got fired because I thought I was doing the right thing and since I wasn't properly trained I got fired over it. 
bad,"Good people to work with, but there was always a negative feeling about the cutbacks and lack of store support."
bad,"Unload truck, carried up heavy items for customers, use the box smasher to smash boxes, cleaned up spills and broken items, at night you worked by you self a lot of the time and that when we had the most carry outs from washer and dryer to refrigerator and disk washer"
bad,I enjoyed the staff I worked with... They were under appreciated...when I left management never said goodbye or did an exit interview
bad,"Job duties do not balance compensation. "
bad,I would come in to work and my co-worker would make fun of the families that would come in to get pictures taken. She was very rude to all customers unless they were her friends. i didn't enjoy working there because of her.
bad,"I would never work for Sears again, typical day started at 7AM-7PM (7 days a week), Some of the workers wanted to work and other tried to loaf, motivating the loafers was tough. Human concerns were tossed out the window."
bad,cashier
bad,typical day is over 12 hrs a day.
bad,"i was still a newbie at Sears. no one was willing to stop and show me how to do my job. for example, no one would show me the basics such as calling co-workers over the intercom, how to fold the clothes (i learned that on my own), how to price items, or where to locate extra merchandise (i learned this in time from another co-worker). everyday when i would come into work, i never knew what department i was working until the day i was fired. no one told me there was a schedule in the backroom where the other MCAs would look to know their department for that day. the management was nice when they hired me, but as i began working in the feild, they expected me to know everything. they didn't show me around or introduce me to the supervisors, they just sent me to work like they thought i knew what i was doing. they would vaugely help if i asked a question. same with my co-workers. they weren't really around to help. they explained very vaugely and were annoyed when i still didn't understand."
bad,I go to work and do my job then come home not really a fun place to work
bad,There wasn't much that was really achieved working here. The management was very unfriendly and unknowledgeable.
bad,"The job was boring,slow pace and not well staffed. Didnt really learn much at this job,just how to fold clothes."
bad,"Store management, district and regional management manage staff by the metrics only. Morning meetings are a joke because why would the staff care about the gross of the store when they know the management does not care about them. Morale is terrible, everyone complains about the way management will beat you up if something is wrong but will very rarely say something positive about anyone in the store. If you sell a lot it's because the store is in a good location. If you sell a lot of protection agreements you hear nothing. Most staff, especially the young 25-35 years old are looking for something else where they can be valued for their efforts. There is so much wrong that I can not list everything."
bad,My typical day was calling customers telling them we couldn't be there
bad,In the first year I was there I had 5 different bosses. Nobody thought this was odd. There was no tracking to see if people were doing their jobs properly. The place is a complete joke. The turnover is so high that it's depressing. This is not a healthy work environment.
bad,"My collegue's were amazing, worked hard and got the job done. Too many managers always making changes"
bad,"A place with lots of management that was extremely dysfunctional. No one knew what their roles were and always passed off work. A very quiet environment. Young customer service, elder management."
bad,"Absolutely no loyalty!!!I worked 4 years as a tech for appliance repair and you get better treatment as a dog at the ASPCA! !!They have no values, everything's is a numbers game! And by the way the Kenmore brand is just a stiker, its made by every other manufacture"
bad,"pues estar checando el probador cada vez q entre el cliente e igual al mismo tiempo atender, lo que me ayudo fue a crecer como persona."
bad,Typical day at Sears was being overworked and underpaid..
bad,"Performance reviews are nonexistent, including raises in pay for at least the last four years."
bad,"Sears has been in the new lately as potentially going out of bussiness. Having worked there I can see why. They are completely backwards and cannot decide what it is they want to do to improve the company. They are changing tactics every month, so by the time you get used to one policy, another replaces it."
bad,"Sears is definitely a last resort type of place. The only thing I liked about this job was the fact that the work was enjoyable for me. The employees seemed to be unfocused and lacking motivation. The were times when hours were very very short and schedules were always adjusted without any notice from management and it was usually changed for the very next day. As for a typical day, you'd come in as early as 6am, and they'll schedule you to leave at 2pm. And when 1:50pm rolls around they'll give you a task to do that takes atleast 3 hours to complete. And no matter if you have an appointment or school, management will expect you to stay the extra 3 hours. If you don't, the next week they'll only schedule you to work 3 hours the entire week. At the end of the day, this is a good place for teens to work after school or during the summer."
bad,It was the longest and most dreadful 4 years of my professional career. I felt horrible for the stress that I endured. Sears will step on anyone at any level and no sooner scrape you off to create more room.
bad,"First of all, I'll start by saying that I actually worked for the REAL Sears, you know, before K-Mart. In total, I spent more than 6.5 years as a consultative sales person and watch things go from good, to not-so-good, to bad, to worse, to terrible. I quit today after having my commission cut for the last time I can stand. They've made it impossible to make any kind of a living. Worse than that, our store of Sebring, FL has the worst store manager I've experienced in my entire life. My fellow staff, who was awesome, and I experienced nothing but constant negativity and bullying on a daily basis since she took over the store over 3 years ago. I'd say that my experience was isolated except for the fact that the current District Manager, as well as the 2 previous, have ignored constant complaints from nearly the entire staff."
bad,This job sucks first job ever nobody care about nobody there no communication or leadership I understand it’s going out of business but wow this store is by the worst customer service I ever seen and manager and loss prevention associates don’t know anything about teamwork or leadership.
bad,Pues la verdad está empresa está bien pero los sueldos están muy bajos y lo peor que está por comisiónes y hay semanas que ni se venden nada en algunas áreas
bad,Too focused on credit applications and syw rewards program. It's clear they prefer quantity over quality. You wont get paid the amount you should be getting.
bad,Managers make up policies & look for reasons  to terminate associates especially if you have woked there for a long time. Also there was a lot of favoritism shown with certain associates & people being looked over that qualified for positions that were given to others that were less qualified & lacked knowledge .
bad,This was my first job and they treated me so terrible. I got hired on October 19th and didn't start working until November. I took 48 hours to send over my drug test and other people that got hired with me started working before me. I don't know if it was my age or what. The on my first day of work they did a terrible job of showing me around and telling me what i could do. I started working the day i was supposed to do orientation. After my first day of work they told me that they would call me the next day and tell me when i can come in to work again because they didn't have me schedule. I called and left voicemails and they didn't answer. They called me a week later and asked why i didn't come into work and i told them what happened and they made it seem like it was my fault. It was just a terrible work experience and i wouldn't want to work there again.
bad,"The job itself isn't too difficult, but the pay isn't all that great in the Sales Associate position. The management really depends on what kond of persom the manager is."
bad,The most stressful job no room for advancement. Most of the employees where nice. But interms of advancing and raisese forget it. They pile on work on others when staff did not show up for there work day.
bad,"Total wreck , the company is shady I would find a company a lot more stable than sears , I’ve seen over 13 managers work there in four year period and either leave or get canned , good folks too, Owner has make this company a complete joke to the retail industry!"
bad,"Sears is going downhill! They hire you as a technical specialist, but then expect you to be a sales person and so much more on top of it for little pay. High stress environment and way too much micro management."
bad,"Hardest part trying to get the trucks unloading on time."
bad,Common practice was unethical treatment of customers who had warranties. lying to customers and rescheduling service calls for cash paying customers on a daily basis.
bad,"Went from hourly plus commission, to commission only. Then made you clean store for no pay while salesmen with more experience got the customers and commission. You had to use I- pad for sales but half of them didn’t work."
bad,Could not get appliances for over 6 weeks in the 3rd quarter last year lost all most all my customers. all our vendors started making Sears pay up front for all products.
bad,"As a part of managment team you work majority of the time 6 days a week, unless your a key holder then you will work 40 no over time allowed. 9 and 10 hour shifts. The pay for the amount of work and stress is definitely not worth it. Staff is underpaid. You will definitely not have family time. You will definitely work holidays and weekends. You are not expected to have a life outside of this job. Hours here will be changed in the middle of the week and you have to be fine with it. Turn over rate is very high."
bad,"I worked here during high school, and I only asked for 15-20 hours/week, however, I was consistently scheduled for 25-30 a week. This wasn't do able for me, and despite multiple conversations with managers, I was continually over-scheduled. Workplace culture is VERY poor, they are not kind or understanding to employees. They constantly change the dress code with very little notice. BUT they are good about allowing plenty of breaks. I worked behind the jewelry counter, and I was able to get a base salary as well as earn commission."
bad,"Great place to work if you are really good at sales but could be better management expects you to make a sales nether customer are already mad and don’t want to spend any money , I would only recommend the job to older people"
bad,"SHIP division leader played favorites. Only likes ""YES"" men. Two faced. No accountability at and level. Leader is a finance person with know working knowledge of the business."
bad,"This company has been going down the drain for years. As time goes by, they eliminate more and more positions and eliminate more and more benefits. Not recommended."
bad,"As a Loss prevention officer you could not do anything to a shop lifter, unless you had 7 things. and with one person in my store I could never do any of them. We would watch people take mechendice right out of the store. It was a joke."
bad,"The work environment was initially alright. Felt pretty slow and easy to pick up. You may feel overwhelmed by the amount of jargon that gets thrown at you on the first few weeks, but it becomes second nature quickly. After the first two weeks of training, you feel confidant enough to get out there and actually provide support, little do you know that you'll be punished later. Their system is really messed up and you're affected negatively if the customer calls back within 7 days no matter what. You get in trouble if you take too many calls during the day, no matter if you provide sufficient support or not. They play favorites and will look the other way if you sell unsuspecting customers warranty contracts. You can go whole day of not helping customers at all but if you sold anything you're in the clear."
bad,"Sears is extremely poorly organized, and is a very stressful environment to work in. The pay is poor and not enough to live on ($8.30/hr). 40 hours will not be typical."
bad,No fue bueno pues no había oportunidad de progresar.
bad,"Required you sold 1 credit card per thirteen customers. Were quick to fire you and make you lie to customers. We would tell them that it wouldn't lower your credit score to apply for a card, when it did. Cashiers have to do every job in the book, be customer service, sell jewelry, sell credit cards, and run entire department yourself. also had to do training on computer constantly no matter your skills."
bad,"The work was ok management was/is the problem for me!!  Co-workers is a plus. Friendly and helpful. long shifts, with little time off. This is Clarksville sears auto center."
bad,"If  you are not able to get an unreasonable amount of people to sign up for a credit card then your hours will be reduced to nothing, which is why I only lasted about a month and a half."
bad,"My job responsibilities included cashiering, unloading new merchandise, and cleaning the store. Unfortunately, there was no possibility of a raise, even for employees who had worker there for 10 + years. I got along with my coworkers fairly well. Business was slow."
bad,Unfortunate that a good company did not survive and had to liquidate. Corporate direction changes were made too late to help the company survive. No true control on expenses.
bad,"I saw that the only thing good about this company is your coworkers and it's true. This place is horrible and only a couple of my coworkers, I could stand. I've worked here before and it was horrible. I came back because I needed a temp job, been hired back for over a month, and I still haven't worked yet. They change the rules constantly. They dropped our employee discount. I've heard more people upset with our rules then happy with them. The managers are a joke as well. I don't recommend working here. It wasn't good as a starter job and I regret going back."
bad,"Sears is on the verge of collapse. Many forces are at fault but I believe the CEO is a major cause of this. Under his ""leadership"" I saw this great company "
bad,"Save yourself the time and disappointment. Management only consults with their higher ups, does not listen, nor respect workers on a daily basis. I had hope for this company, only to be disappointed by their lack of logic and professionalism."
bad,In my time at Sears Auto I learned a lot.  Early on I learned that Sears were not competitive with other shop with paying the techs.  Sears paid base plus commission.  The base was low way under mininum wage.  There theory was that the commission would make up for the low base.  You had to work really hard to make enough to live ok not well just ok.  The upper level management was bad.  They are the reason Sears has fallen apart.  There were managers that didn't last long and other who lasted less.  They tried to change the culture of sears but all failed miserably.  In the end after years my shop closed not because we were a bad shop that didn't make money.  We were one of the top rated Sears Auto stores in the nation.  The company that bought the land that my shop was on drilled holes in our floor to see if there new land has been contaminated.  We passed with flying colors and they closed our shop because they don't want a repair center on the property to lower there resale value.  That is the Sears experience.
bad,A very unsatisfying place to work. Unorganized and unprofessional management staff. The high pressure to push sales amongst a declining amount of customers felt oppressive in many ways.
bad,"This position requires speaking over the phone with customers who are having problems with their household appliances. Hopefully the problem can be resolved over the phone, however if it cannot a technician can be sent to repair the appliance. Selling of product coverage plans."
bad,"A rat race to improve the product and price but people didn't shop at Sears because the stores are outdated and unkempt.  "
bad,"my manager was a great guy, but it did not make up for the fact that the metrics that they placed on you were ludicrous. the people who worked there were very kind, but their moral was being destroyed over time."
bad,"Great local staff, terrible company that starts with the CEO and trickles down the management tree to the district managers who blame their short comings on store level associates. Store won't be around for long."
bad,Managers are like a click. Respectable employees are turned down for advancement while new hires with similar qualifications are given the job. Given limited resources to perform basic job functions. Jewelry sales are very difficult to perform due to limited resources and even less support from upper management.
bad,"I liked it at first, until they changed management. When this happened then it became a circus. Ok when I worked for Sears I got hired on making 13.80. Three months later I requested a transfer to s store closer to home and where there was more action. When I got to the new store the store manager didn't like my salary and was vocal about to the point that everyone in the store eventually knew how much I got paid. The animosity that I got was crazy, even though month after month I was number one in apprehensions and the only non manager to be certified to make fitting room stops. And I trained and certified everyone hired after me in my store and two others."
bad,"Taking calls for Sears customers who are having issues with Their appliances. The Management changed often, and was unorganized. The workplace culture was negative as nearly all employees had negative outlook on the center. People would leave early or call out on a regular basis. The hardest part was dealing with the negativity while still trying to provide good service."
bad,"A lost company. The management is terrible expecting you to not make sales or give golden fashion advice, but to sell their confusing, no one cares credit cards. they suck."
bad,"To be an appliances sales associate at sears, you have to fight to get a customer, then you have to do your best to sell, and if you just sell the appliances, you are making 1% of the selling price + 9% of the margin. and because of the computation, there is not too much margin especially on holidays sales event."
bad,Good paying job but not enough help when needed...mangers always are never there when I need them customers are rude. But they do have a good pay rate and benefits
bad,There is no room for advancement in this company. The overall moral of employees is very poor. Unfortunately the company is in financial trouble and the employees are suffering for it.
bad,I hated working for this company. There were no room to grow here at all unless you were bestfriends with someone in management. The pay was horrible and they constantly nagged you about promoting their credit cards and getting people to purchase protection plans on everything. If you didn't then your job would be threatened. Never Work There!
bad,Bad place to work in. Always pushing for credit card sales which are not in your control if the customers just simply decide not to apply to the card.
bad,"All of the revenue goes to corporate.  Corporate is very disconnected with the field stores resulting in store closings.  CEO's main concern is putting money in his own pocket at whatever expense necessary. I.E. Buying out lease contracts from his own stores, taking their rent money, and then closing the stores."
bad,Don't work for this company. Rearranging my whole life for themabd they couldn't even give me another job after my store closed down.  They shorted me money they owed me as well.
bad,"All they care about is getting credit card enrollments. If you cant do that you don't get hours. I recently worked there and did great getting credit, I was promised a raise and never received it. No matter how hard you work it's rare for them to congratulate you. Management made me feel like no matter what I do I do it wrong. Favoritism plays a big role as well. They wait for the last minute to do things for corporate."
bad,"even though they gave me tools, truck, Iphone, uniforms that was not enough. they did not tell me that this position was a seasonal one and if they did tell that I sure would not left my other job. did not like the way the company laid me off"
bad,A typical day at sears is to do many transactions and get credit. The company revolves al around credit and forces you to open credit cards or you would be disciplined which is not professional.
bad,"I hated working at Mcdonalds. Every work day was a struggle and I waited for time to pass. The customers are always very very rude and inpatient. A lot of time they treat you like you're lower then them. But what can I say, I was a 16 year old working part time to earn gas money. I didn't know any better, but I know I didn't deserved the unfair treatment from customers"
bad,"Pretty much, if you do not have a family and have absolutely no responsibilities, this job is perfect for you because they do not care if you do or not!! Day after day i continue to slave away for these people and that does not matter unless i transform into a sales man. You are required to sell more to customers than to actually fix appliances. Apparently this is the only way for sears to make money which is scary. I applied to this job to be a repair man not a sales man. the sears service system is completely unorganized. I worked for 3 appliance companies doing the same thing in the past, and by far sears has been the worse. Its funny because before applying i myself was reading these reviews and saw similar complaints and i said to my self that these people are just complain. turns out they were right haha. Anyways, I'm done ranting, hope this review helps your future."
bad,"I hated working at Sears, especially during the seasonal times because they expected you to work there and stay there for minimum wage which was ridiculous. There were terrible customers everyday, all day. You had to ask about the credit card or a senior co-worker would get on to for not asking about it, and it was so stupid. I hated having to ask people about Credit Cards for sears during the seasons because they were always in a rush. We learned tons of stuff but, it was hard to remember it all out on the sales floor. The management was not the best because, they would randomly put out coupons and just randomly come by and tell you to remember to scan that so, of course you would be forget. The hardest part is remembering stuff like coupons being just thrown at you by managers, remembering to ask about the credit card, and all this in the season time when people want to get in and get out. The most enjoyable part was nothing really because, I made almost no money there. "
bad,"As a Visual Merchandise Market Leaders I was responsible for 7 stores in Ma and NH and trained in hardline/soflines, responsible for training and coaching in store merchandisers, manager and visual teams."
bad,"Basically unload truck 2 days a week, assist with merchandise pick up(locate,scan,load into customer vehicle),move merchandise to to sales floor,warehouse inventory.not a hard job but should be paid more than minimum wage because of the repeated heavy lifting of appliances and furniture.minimum wage and part time hours to avoid offering benefits is how Sears profit.if you want extra income its a ok place but as a primary source of income you will be struggling to make ends meet"
bad,"I feel that Sears has Unfair job practices,such as bad communication skills with their technician.Also their training techique should upgraded."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment of people, other than that it wasn't the job for me. Some of the managers were very welcoming though."
bad,I've worked for Sears since July 2014 and haven't missed a day since I started working there except when i went to my grandmother's funeral. I'm dedicated to my job and to providing the best customer experience to customers.
bad,"at sears, there is very little room for advancement because it is retail. If a retail company tells you there is lots of room for advancement.. they are lying. The work isnt hard, however you have to stand for long periods of time. The people who work there are all nice, but they all have way too much stress put on them and you can tell."
bad,"The store basically only wants one thing, and that's for you to open credit cards. If you don't they'll fire you. While I enjoyed working with some of the employees there was still a whole lot of toe crushing going on due to the fact that everyone was trying to open up these credit cards. Despite the fact that you were expected to sell your soul to open up these cards, I enjoyed my time in the department despite the poisonous environment."
bad,"They want you to work alot for a little minimum wage pay. The managers SUCK!! There are NO raises, no opportunity to move up, registers are OLD AS DUST. Lines are always long. Do yourself a favor & don't apply."
bad,"Company is trying to become profitable, but it is not working.  Had to obtain product and programs/equipment is from the 1970's"
bad,HH Gregg and Sears appliances installations are contracted to BP Installs LLC. BP Installs is a very poor company to work for. It is a small home ran business that is ran by some one who has no knowledge of laws or rules of owning a business. They treat their workers very poorly and will steal money off the top if their own pocket is hurting
bad,"My brother worked at Sears Logistics for nearly 20 years before they decided to get rid of him and do what their good at, Hire Temps. Sinking ship of a company, who deserve to be sunk."
bad,"Merchandising and display set up.  Clearing off register area of unwanted clothing, keeping the dressing rooms clean.  Helping the customers with their clothing, housewares, and jewelry needs."
bad,"customer service tech resolves problems with defective parts for various appliances and electronics.hardest part of the job is dealing with an out-dated computer system,down a good percent of the work day,the most enjoyable part of the job is resolving problems and customer satisfaction,guiding other techs. thru very difficult repairs"
bad,"County change register safe, give away pay checks on every pay day, verify pick ups orders, call customers to let them know their orders were ready for pick up, secure register tills at closing time as well to announce a bilingual store close time. Management were team players. The co-workers were also team players. the hardest part was to get better working hours to fits into my availabilities. The most enjoyable part was to work into a very relax and happy work area."
bad,Its not a healthy place for people especially for teenager. I learn that you can't trust anybody at work. The management are so easy to give back broken or used items that being return. The managements are a big liars. All they care about is SEARS CREDITCARD.
bad,"Overall, there really wasn't anything that was enjoyable about working at Sears. I pretty much dreaded going in to work every day. This is for a number of reasons. First off, when I decided to take the job, I was supposed to be a Sales Associate working for commissions. Also, my base rate was supposed to be $9 an hour. When I got there and actually started to work though, they put me on a register as a regular cashier. I still got my $9 an hour though, at first. Then they moved me to the shoe department, and told me that this was where I was going to be from that point forward. No commissions can be made in the shoe department. My background is in Sales, and I only took this job because it was supposed to be a base pay plus commissions pay structure which would have made the job worth taking. They didn't honor any of that, and to top it all off, they dropped my pay down to minimum wage. I only got paid the $9 for the first 2 weeks that I was there. "
bad,"cashier , stock, count drawer. it was ok when i was part time told them i wanted to stay part time so to many hours ."
bad,"Two weeks after giving birth, I was laid off.  The RHRM did not submit my separation in time and I was over paid.  Then the HRSC sent me repayment demands."
bad,If management doesnt like you at green acres mall they will fire you before your probation is up. If they like you you'll stay for a long time.Its all feelings. Some people arent cut out for merchandising and customer associate(MCA)
bad,"The management there is terrible. I would call for a supervisor and they wouldn't show up until 20 minutes later, and because of their laziness i would lose sales."
bad,It pays the bills. i work at a mall location. I think a side store would be better. I wish our location had a limit number of cloethes you can try on in the fitting rrom. The fitting room is always bursting at the seams when i come in at 5.
bad,i hated this place. The managemet sucked. People are rude. They work their workers too hard for too little cash.
bad,"Start with opening the store, starting up register, opening camera rooms, cleaning up the mess from the night before, confirming appointments, running the photography rooms and sales tables, running daily reports, having conference calls, filing paper work, delivering picture packages, making cold calls to get clients in the door and so much more. I learned that this employer is an employment mill and does not want experienced workers. Management was great! I loved my managers and then I became an assistant manager before I left the company. My co-workers became some of my closest friends and we made work fun to go to every day. The hardest part of my job was when selling and showing your sessions we pretty much had to put out or largest and most expensive packages and go through about 10 different options for their session. It's too much for the client to have to deal with. I lost hours for work on a weekly basis unless we had an average weekly sales of $200 or better. What I enjoyed most is my love for photography. I had client requests on a daily basis. When I left the company, so did my clients. Sears Portrait Studio at the time of my departure, closed the store at 8pm. I was let go as an employee/assistant manager because I didn't offer an 8pm appointment to a cold caller. We were required to offer appointments for up to 7:30 because we closed at 8pm on the dot. I had been an employee for almost 7 years and was let go with no warnings or write ups in my whole career with them. I have been pretty much unemployed ever since."
bad,Company does not care about employees as well as customers/@ one point it did but not when i left/did not listen to employees on any problems and did away with employee oriented self sustaining programs run by internal employees/extreme favoritism was shown to certain csrs and managers/good people that were with company for years werre leaving or separated from company
bad,"When Sears owned the company it was a great place to work. When Kmart bought the company it went down hill fast. Work vans do not get replace, over worked, unreasonable sales goals for area worked. This company is more concerned with selling the customer on contracts and over priced add on's. They do not want to stand behind their contracts and try to get out of any chance they get. Management at local level is good. District level management is out of touch with what goes on in the field. Hardest part of this job is dealing with unqualified help staff in routing department and constant changing or rules for different individuals. The most enjoyable part of this job was dealing with the client base."
bad,"poor experience lack of organization of management team, no store organization"
bad,La verdad el ambiente laboral fue lo que me hizo salirme de ahi
bad,"I worked there for 3 years, was the Sales Manager there for almost 2 years. Management was horrible. They don't care or respect you as an employee, to them you are just another one and you are easily replaced. When you ask for days off they don't let you even when you've asked 1 month in advanced instead of 2 weeks (mostly recommended)."
bad,Sears is very flexible when it comes to availability and you can essentially chose when and when you cannot work. The pay is not great but anyone needing a part time or full time position can apply and expect to work around their availability.
bad,With our Sears in Meridian now closed there are no Sears in the state of MS. But parts and service was a great place to work with even better people to work with.
bad,"Great coworkers some manager great to worker for, learned many new things ! break room , perks . not much more to say .people was leaving do to Poor treatment of staff."
bad,"Sears was a cool place to work until they stopped giving raises, and tripled the workload with no raise in 4 years. The mandatory overtime was ridiculous, and the air conditioning never worked."
bad,"Didn't work here long, but there short time I did I learned Sears is no longer Sears, but it's now transformco. They pushed you to sell their new warranties (to mainly elderly customers) that didn't really cover their appliances like the old warranties did. Also the new manger they hired in was clueless mechanically, (once held a wrench upside down to use it) but knew more about the appliance than you."
bad,"Don’t do it. Save yourself the trouble of trying to find another job in a little while. "
bad,It was near impossible to get anything done because of the structure of the business units. Though I knew the role there wouldn't be forever I did not expect it to only last 6mo.
bad,"The only way to get a promotion is being female and befriend with the managers."
bad,"Although the people who work for Sears are extraordinary, the corporate office is a mess, the problem resolution for both staff and customers is set up to make everyone fail. The system from top down is disorganized and the company is trying to make as much money for its investors before they eventually all go down."
bad,"It was fun to learn about everything I was selling and to form relationships with the customers I interacted with every day. However, the pay was low and I feel that I didn't even get paid my commission sometimes. The management was really nice but not entirely competent, and corporate seemed to have no idea how to make the business better to keep their heads above water. Responsibility was assigned to those who worked the hardest, which I liked, and everyone working in our section knew it inside and out because we had a very small number of employees. Sales goals were often unrealistic and we were penalized for missing them. I was often given 39+ hours a week and no offer of full time or benefits from this company. Disorganization and a lack of consideration for customer satisfaction were what ultimately brought this business down. I learned a lot from working here for 6 months, but I would not recommend it to anyone unless you are desperate for a job."
bad,"Management has a tendency to notice which workers are inept or lazy and as opposed to reprimanding or letting them go, they simply give their share of work to other employees. Especially in my department where heavy lifting is a common occurrence, if you prove yourself physically capable, you will get calls from throughout the store to help every employee or customer with any item above 40lbs. And unfortunately many items in the store such as refrigerators or washers and dryers weigh an excess of 150lbs."
bad,"there is no stable schedule, requires you to be willing to give up your personal life to work there. cannot plan ahead because you dont know if there will be work the following day. constant micromanaging with observations like crazy. managers are nice but the system and culture lacks concern for the employees."
bad,"I was a merchandiser and I had a lot to do.  I had to keep the store presentable, help customers with concerns, and many other tasks.  Individuals on commission did not do anything.  When work was slow, they bundled up together and talked for hours, even the store manager.  Management was horrible, no one cared unless you were racking in the money."
bad,Poorly ran by ceo.  Just wasn't organized enough.  We had a great group of people but upper management ran it into the ground. Management took away all our perks and no raises for about 15years.
bad,"lots of good people working for a company that's in a lot of turmoil and trouble"
bad,My experience of working of working at Sears was overall not bad. My store manager never really left his office. Assistant managers basically were the only helpful people there.The employees got along fine.
bad,"While I met some great people working for Sears Parts Direct, not the main retail store, it was difficult at times to be motivated to show up to work. The store manager was an awesome person, we remained friends once the store shut down, but upper management made it difficult for us to do our job when we sold parts that once opened or installed could not be returned, yet they continued to make us return parts that had obviously been installed and in some cases even used. We would inform customers that we were not technicians and in know way could diagnose a problem. We were only there to look up parts and order if need be, in some cases we could make an educated guess if we felt we had enough information. Most times we knew enough to help with pretty basic repairs to equipment or offer some advice before hiring a technician or repair shop to look at the issue. I can confidently say in my time their I helped many customers save hundred's of dollars in repairs or new item purchases for something as small as a thermal fuse or even a cut off of some sort. I had a great time with most of the people I worked with."
bad,"Reneged on employment contract by taking away employee discount and tripling job responsibility. Laid off half the store, expected 2 sales people to maintain the whole store in addition to working the registers. The heat was excruciating. Company refused to fix air despite customer and employee complaints. Cashier area damaging to the back - improper flooring for standing/working. No chance of raise or vacation for part timers. SHOPLIFTERS MAKE MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE WORKING IN THE STORE."
bad,"I was happy working for Sears until the past year. With the company struggling the focus of an in-home technician went from diagnose and repair to making a sale. There was too much emphasis place on making revenue and not correcting the actual problem customers were having. Long wait times, damaged parts should have been more of a focus. With those areas corrected i believe the company would be more profitable from the service side."
bad,"In the last several years, always waiting for more layoffs and reorg.  revolving door of management teams at the highest levels, these SVPs would bring in their own teams, completely disrupt the organization and in less then 2 years, leave leave, assuming with full contract.  no traction on strategies nor funding of critical updates to technology infrastructure."
bad,The management team is by far the worst I have experienced. We are thrown into projects/new work with no information or training. The benefits are poor. The pay is decent. Wouldn't mind working here if it were managed better and provided better heath insurance.
bad,"Company is a mess. You never know day to day if you will still have a job. Most people with knowledge of the systems are gone, so there is no one to go back to with experience to answer questions.  Most jobs going to India."
bad,"Culture is great as the people are professionals."
bad,all they want you to do is sell credit cards. Especially to the little old unsuspecting ladies. its a terrible enviorment that encourages low morals. the job was terrible
bad,Management was horrible. When I was interviewed the woman made it seem like it was a positive envoriment but acted completely different when I started working there. It was like walking on egg shells and gave me a lot of anxiety. The only thing that helped me push forward was the kids I was taking photographs of and the happy parents purchasing packages because they loved the pictures so much. Other than that it was very hard to work.
bad,"It doesn't matter what the customer problem is, "
bad,"Poor management skills, if you don't are part of the circle of the butt kissing employees you will have problems. It's a good company, but the management it's horrible."
bad,"This store stinks of desperation. Unprofessional management that only gives enough hours to make a living, to very distasteful supervisors so they will keep her secrets from when she was an employee and new manager, unless you can sell credit. Then just that one person who can get the most credit consistently, gets more hours.  We do not even bother to remember anyone's name anymore until they have been here for a substantial amount of time because the turnover is ridiculous and a huge waste of money, just like shop your way. I never buy anything here anymore unless its on clearance for less than a dollar, because you never know if it is going to fall apart. Our electronics associate informed me that the t.v. we raffled off for credit apps didn't even work and that the employee wasted money on batteries and a remote for it and basically had to beg our manager to take it back so the associate didn't have to PAY to get rid of the junk they supposedly ""won"". Apparrently that also happenned to another employee as well, according to the electronics guy. It was an employee who has worked practicaly every position in the store for like 20 years or something crazy like that.I already have another job now and it makes me realize even more, how stressful it was to keep up with the dramatic changes that have happened these last few months. There is no way I could compete at selling credit, as I was never trained to do that. Its just sad."
bad,"Although my department manager was great, the store manager lacked any sort of effectiveness in operating the store and managing its employees. The store also unfairly pays its sales associates, especially its base + commission model where associates are paid a $6/hr base wage and make 1% on gross sales for their department only. Expected hourly sales as projected by the company itself never even come close to the $500/hr you need to sell in order to just clear minimum wage, so the company screws its employees with a minimum wage adjustment on your check. Ridiculous, if any human being is actually wondering why Sears is going under ask ANY sales associate at the store."
bad,The overall job experience is negative 0. The job itself is a piece of cake. However the overall dings you get for not meeting certain conversions etc. is wrong.
bad,Working for them is very stressful. Each day goes by and your unsure if your store will stay open or shut down. Management is ok. At times it feel like they're unsure of what's really going on within the company.
bad,Hated the fact I was the only one who new how to work returns. Had a hard time calling in or even talking vacation without being called about how to do something. Corporate doesn't care about is employees. Always asked for more from their employees for their own gain. No raises and terrible benefits if it was offered. A place where the harder you work the less you get paid. Hard for anyone to wanna stay and work hard if there's no incentive. Why bother after years of working hard for a company that doesn't care about you.
bad,You get to meet all kinds of people. Customers are grateful for your help. You have the chance to make someone's day. Typical day at work is spent alone when you are not with a customer.
bad,"Was a comfortable small environment, until it was closed down. Most of the Sears and Kmarts are closing. Due to everyone ordering things online. Online Retail Giants like Amazon make it so easy to order from the comfort of your own home."
bad,At first the job was pretty cool the workers are cool the managers were cool then they were rude and smart non caring the work areas were filthy. They showed favoritism
bad,On écoute mes propos.  On accepte mes idées.  Et une grande confiance des mes choix et ma disponibilité.
bad,"This place is a mess, you can clearly see why Sears has not been doing well for the past decade or so. Management was too focused selling credit cards and rewards cards rather on the customer experience."
bad,This company is a dying entity. Once a manager leaves they replace them with anyone willing to do the job. Store managers included. The store I worked at in Louisiana refused to fix the air conditioning.
bad,"I would not recommend working for sears unless you are willing to compromise your morals to do so. They base your job performance off of how many credit cards and memberships you can shove down customers throats. You basically have to bully customers into getting memberships and credit cards if you want to keep your job. the entire customer service culture doesn't really serve the customers, the overall theme is to milk the customers for all that they're worth rather than actually serving the customers. Management breathes down your neck about membership numbers and credit card sign ups all day everyday. The overall experience has left me with a very less than positive perception of Sears."
bad,when demonstrating customer service employees are reprimanded in front of customers.  there is little to no consistency within the management teams
bad,"Slowest Laziest Job Ever"
bad,"Long hours, never enough time to get your work done.  Could be a fun job if things were different.  It is nice to have a company truck."
bad,"Leaders are so focused on the minutiae that they can't or won't see and implement the obvious solutions. They are amazed that when managers spend 8 hours a day staring at a spreadsheet, the associates do not perform well. There is VERY little training for the managers, and people that are good performers are hired to be managers. They are lost."
bad,Do not bother working here it sucks. Go in early leave late. The managers are horrible and that is all and they work you like a slave
bad,I worked there for a little over 7 months and was passed up for 2 possible promotions that I was qualified for for people who I ended up having to train to be my new boss. When I gave a letter of resignation that was effective immediately they wanted me to come in and discuss it and I refused stating that I no longer wished to be employed with Sears and was fired that day as a no call no show
bad,"The company is struggling for survival... and that desperation and poor management decisions makes this once iconic brand a modern day verison of the Titanic, and those still on board are like the band playing as the ship takes on water goes under."
bad,"hour sucked some weeks 26hrs another week 16hrs."
bad,"loved working for walmart, the store couldve used better maintaince but over all the customers as well as the workers were very friendly and the management were patient and kind."
bad,Sears has no idea what they are doing as a company. Very unstable.
bad,I would not work for this company nor wold I recommennd this company to anyone else
bad,Culture inexistante avec un management très désagréable. sears semble encore vivre dans le monde du passe avec aucune vision pour le future. L'environment du travail etait parfois platonique mais les employees sont toujours pres a aider. Les opportuniter d'avancement sont quasi inexistante.
bad,"good bosses, diversified schedule, much customer contact, working with and learning from fellow workers"
bad,Managers don't care about employers well being as long as they manage to sell credit cards. No room for raises and advancement. Empty praise and will harass you the next day if you don't manage to sell enough. If you must work here actively look for better jobs. Sears will take you no where.
bad,Sears allowed me to start off as a lead.  I had already had 2 years back round in sales and 5 years backround in being a cashier.  I was responsible of over 25 cashiers and pushing the number of credit card sales at the registers.  I did this job until i found a sales postion at cablevision in which i new was a better move for me
bad,"Responsible for merchandise pickup and returns in a timely fashion, gathering returned merchandise before store opening. Printing the pre-load sheet report for markout, sort and pack merchandise for shipping, assist with ship from store if required and unloading merchandise from trucks"
bad,Assisting customers with merchandise and general questions.
bad,Hate this company. They start u off at minimum wage and don't tell u that u will stay there bc there's a freeze on raises. Hours were always low.
bad,was hired for a specific location but of course when districts move so does everyone else. was basically made to drive over an hour a day to my store. was also paid WELL below the avg salary for management...
bad,"Too much miscommunication amongst aspects of the company"
bad,It was a stressful job position. They make their employees to force the customers into signing up for a sears card. The employee has to collect a certain amount of credit apps. if not they'll find a way to fire you from their company.
bad,Not a good company to work for. i would not recommend them to any one.
bad,"A very stressful enviorment to work in, they train you to be a cashier and throw you into other departments such as shoes expecting you to just know where and how to follow the procedures for that."
bad,Spent putting out new receipts and working area typicals. Learned to be extremely creative . Management was decent. Co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was that there was usually not enough manpower to do what was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was sending customers away happy with the intent to shop with me again.
bad,"The time I was at Sears Holdings Corp. I expected more professionalism, reality there is none. It was just a job where it basically paid the bills and it was secure for the moment; only that."
bad,"My hats off to the people who could/can do that job, though I don't understand why people will stay at a job they constantly complain about."
bad,Friendly but very slow im the type i like to stay busy cant make money if you dont have products to sell. But if you are a student in school and need a job its a perfect job for you
bad,Sears was originally a nice place to work prior to all the financial unsettling that it has gone through including the recent bankruptcy. The store closing and every store in our area closing makes it extremely difficult to recommend for anyone to work at now.
bad,"I would not recommend working for sears due to the rising amount of store closures. I don't see the company being around another 25 years in order for someone to retire from there. The management is the number one reason I left, I loved my job and I loved the overall company. however the management was inexperienced and did not seem to care to help the staff out when they needed guidance."
bad,puppy mill.  I made it longer than anyone in my class.  HIGH TURNOVER.  Many quit in training.  1-3 leads a day.  drive up to 300  miles.  High pressure sales.  Some good people there.  Jobs slow it install sometimes causing cancellations.  Always ding your commission.
bad,"To many associates for customer base, Could not come close to living on salary. Pay is draw so if you can not make min wage you will get paid min., however you would need to pay it back."
bad,"Working at sears, the people tend to be nice. Overall it's not a nice experience; many of your coworkers are very cutthroat trying to get more customers while failing to actually train you on the job you are suppose to do. Many will call seniority and many of those who simply worked far longer command management and make called that only management is meant to handle. Many of the workers will also make you feel uncomfortable with working due to personality and other traits. In addition they will not alert you on changes to schedules or answer phone calls on the subject (let alone an email) leaving you in the dark about meetings, new products, and other information even if you ask the other staff and management a entire list to study. There is an unwillingness to teach, help, or correct anything in the workplace leaving even the most dedicated and cooperative workers lost at what to do how the company wants you to do it."
bad,"this job was incredibly slow and not very fun, management was terrible to head management constantly has his head in everyone's business making this job incredibly hard."
bad,The place was very good until 2016. Now due to business down fall it has become highly Insecure place and layoff is happening each quarter. You never know when your job is gone
bad,"So to start off, being an Appointment Specialist is super easy, yes you do have to meet certain expectations but it’s easy bar to meet. The pay is good. All the employees and management are shady, and don’t want to help. They fired me for no reason 2 weeks before my 90 days and $500 bonus, I was the highest selling on my team. I made $150K in 30 days.. I sold a lot of home warranties, I was polite, punctual and have always held a professional job. People start rumors and try and disminish your job/career."
bad,"No room for advancement or raises. Stores closing, so constantly worried about job security.  Store managers are nice and care for you.  Some of the district mangers are ok as well."
bad,"Poor management has made job less profitable.  Not an enjoyable work environment. Salaried  Management motivated by hitting metrics that benefit their numbers more than overall sales.  Example,manager would rather have a $500 sale with a $120 add on than a $5000 sale without an add on."
bad,"They would start your day with a bad morning meeting energy everyday. We all know that we must keep the selling standard but we all did the best we could and we don't like being scared to work, we don't like to force customers or annoy them. Many people tried of this place and they have to quit the job."
bad,"Sears is a place where they take a lot of issues and just don't do anything with them. When you have an issue with anyone, you really cannot trust management to help, because they will ignore you through and through."
bad,It is too bad to see Sears go. I had a great career there with great people. They were flexible and fair until the end. Great products to sell. I will miss Kenmore.
bad,you have to sit in a department and wait on customers to come ask you questions.  There arnt a lot of customers.  Makes time crawl by.  I would rather be working then standing waiting for something to do
bad,"As a sales associate for Sears I was told I would get a minimum of 25 hours a week. Favoritism is a huge play in the Sears work place, and that is complete and utter bull. Sinking ship I tell ya."
bad,Over the last two years the company has been going in downward direction. Part by the company itself and the constant changing of the managers in different departments.
bad,Our center was one of top store in two combined districts. Just not enough to keep Sears up and going. It was a great company to work for and wish I could have retired with them.
bad,The location shutdown because upper management and the CEO decides to close locations because of financial distress.  So long as it were to be run by those in the industry it would have flourished.
bad,"terrible company to work for. the place is obviously going out of business. The management is terrible , the stores purchase to much merchandise that all goes on clearance, lines are extremely long becuase they make you do credit and the computers are old . they shut down , freesze, the company gives away so much money in points .who ever runs sears stores doesnt know how to run a business. no idea . cashiers don't have hours, and so you end up working by yourself with a long line that cuases stress. you dont even get a discount, not that you would want it. the only good thing is your coworkers if you're lucky. at the sears in buena park the ASM is innaproriate  pretty sure he's in  a relationship with a cashier. the store manager doesnt even know how to do simple tasks in the store like remove sensors or apply coupons.  You recieve no help from any other manager either and people constantly have drama with eachother. its best if you dont work here or shop here either"
bad,This store was losing a good bit of money and turned off the air conditioning mid-day in order to save money. I worked in the Loss Prevention Division which seemed to really want to do its job but was restrained by its budget. The Division was efficient and had some smart people at my district.
bad,"Being forced to annoy the customers by asking them over and over to sign up for a credit card made me hate working there. Work at sears if you want the customers to hate you,"
bad,Hostile work environment management is rude the ask you to work doubles sometimes triples they have certain goals said that you have to accomplish everyday and if you don't you get talked to
bad,It's done nothing more to really say there's no room for advancement. Everything is slowly starting to suck including customer service . Unfortunately I don't see it improving and trying to grow and hold on with Sears is not a great idea
bad,"Management was horrible. i would not recommend anyone to work at the particular facility I was at."
bad,"I had a bad experience with Sears which  was my first job, I got confused in my work ( Apparel associate)  cause they have  unorganized system, they don't  train a new hiring. They throw many responsibilities on one person. The worst part of this job that I suffered, they do n't have flexible schedule, so I couldn't  balance with my school. Remember, If you try to ask them about changing your work time, they are going to FIRE you, yes they have unfair manager."
bad,SHC is a challenging environment to excel within. More problems to solve than solutions available and a consistent lack of resources to solve them.
bad,"Sears is on the demise and is a high risk company to join. If you accept a job here, just be aware that you could be on the search again soon given their overall poor performance as a company."
bad,Unfortunately working for Sears requires excellent work but not where near the compensation to match. Heavy lifting of appliances that ill never be able to afford while working here.
bad,Management sucks. All they really care about is getting people to sign up for the Sears credit cards and base your job effort over that when there's really nothing you can do if a customer simply does not want to apply for credit. Long-time cashiers act like they're too good for you and make ugly faces when in reality all they are are cashiers... we're on the same boat buddy. If you're new you gotta do all the work while the rest stand around and do whatever they want cause they got the hook up with management. Go according to the favorite long-time cashiers' preferred schedule and leave you with the rags. So glad it's over!
bad,"Store focused too much on following planograms that didn't fit into the space given. Whenever I felt the need (which was very often), I ditched the preferred planogram and used my own skills to create a layout for merchandise that made more sense and kept the shelves looking full. Corporate rarely sent the new merchandise requested each week from associates, which some people just stopped putting in orders for specific merchandise to be re-stocked due to such inconsistencies."
bad,It's a great place to work at if you have great co-workers.  Sometimes management just isn't that helpful and they don't seem to be happy at work either.
bad,"Executive officers change every 6 months or less.  They burn through large amount of capital paying consultants for ideas that are already known and have been suggested by existing experience workforce.  Before they can even learn their business, they have left the company while collecting a large exit package.  High level and middle management input is routinely ignored and never rewarded."
bad,"A typical day at work was myself and other MCA's, cleaning and sorting clothes to be neatly put back on the rack they belonged to, or helping a cashier at the registers if the lines were too long."
bad,level 1 techs start at 5.50 an hour with 1 dollar for a 4 tire rotation. Pay is really weak.  and they ask you (level 1 techs) to stack tires at 5.50 and hour with the higher techs are doing your or taking your level one commission work..
bad,Assisted customers at the register and with other concerns.  Also handled financial transactions and phone calls.
bad,This is a good company to work for it just has bad human resources.
bad,"I am currently on medical leave from the 9695 store in Gas City, Indiana. During my leave, I discovered my job is being advertised on indeed.com. I was lead to believe that I had this great support system. Not only did they deny my FMLA due to not being employed long enough to their standards but I am flat broke due to the leave. "
bad,"repaired small engines such as mowers,snowblowers chainsaws vaccum"
bad,Was working as a supervisor in training for 4 months and was never compensated for the job i was doing. When a realignment was done to meet the needs of the business i was never interviewed for the supervisor position that was open.
bad,Management is not up to what it should be. My experience with this company is that they are very sneaky.
bad,helping customers with thefitting room and helping customers find the proper mershandise.
bad,"Store management with archaic thinking and fascist ideals. Overall a sinking ship and a waste of time for employees.I was especially lucky enough to train my replacement. Once the customer base dies off...which should be in the near future, I can't see why anyone else will want to shop here."
bad,Learned how to work in a high volume call cente. Had loads of overtime.
bad,Taught new hire classes. Learn how to interview canidates. And speak to the as well
bad,"All this company cared about was pushing their terrible credit card on every customer that walked through the door. It held up lines and made people angry so they obviously didn't want to hear the same credit card pitch. If it wasn't the cards, it was extended warranties. They only care about the numbers."
bad,Management never helped out with anything.  Our store was understaffed. There was so much to do and things never got done because the store was poorly managed.
bad,"Enjoyed my job and learned quite a bit while working there, but the future of Sears is shaky.  The company has quite a few promising assets —along with some heavy-hitters from other successful companies like Nike —in its arsenal so maybe they'll prove the business world wrong and come out of the bankruptcy a solid, profitable company."
bad,I don't expect it to be open to much longer the owner is running the place into the ground and using it as a piggy bank. The pay is decent if you can find a busy store.
bad,"Tu debes caerle muy  bien a quien sera tú jefes inmediato , a la o al gerente de ventas, al o la director de tienda, para que Te ayuden con lo que necesites como por ejemplo la planta, en el período de prueba,  que es menos de 60 días, o a las de RHS , por  que si no es así te hacen la estancia muy pensada, a deben tenerer un sentido del humor súper agrió, Reírse de todo como si estuvieras loco y aguantar las humillaciónes, que sobajen, te traten muy mal, hasta que termines por aceptar que eres un inepto para el cargó y los regaños con gritos frente a los clientes, de tu supervisora y la gerente ,con la cabeza baja y al punto de que las lagrimas te rueden, y tienes la planta, y tu sin poder decir y hacer nada para defenderte. Suerte y no ENTREGUEN DOCUMENTOS ORIGINALES  porque no se los REGRESAN,"
bad,Store ended up closing. Found a better job with a different company due to the company not willingly to relocate any of its employees. It was an ok job if the pay would of been better.
bad,"Ever since the corporates combined all the positions into one the company has really gone down hill. There are little to no working hours. No raises, and job advancements or other opportunites in the company."
bad,I worked at Sears for years it was great because the schedule gave me time to spend with my family. It was competitive and that made it challenging. I think that I had lots of success at Sear because I motivate myself. I enjoyed helping clients.
bad,"My team was outstanding.  However, the overall culture of Sears was failing.  They continued to knick benefits and it was well over $1200 + for health insurance a month.  No matching 401 nor pension."
bad,"I went to work primarily for access to health insurance which was out of reach for the small business I was operating at the time in 2005. Advancements came quickly due to my desire to make things happen and the many opportunities that were available to streamline workflows."
bad,"When things were good, they were very good, decent commission. Hours were good in the beginning, started to gradually cut them down. Hours missing on paycheck and would take a long time to resolve the issue. management would do the bare minimum to help or take care of employees."
bad,"Muy mal ambiente poco sueldo y muy exigentes."
bad,"I found out I was pregnant while working at Sears. I was high risk, had a doctor's note to be able to keep bottled water with me at all times. Sears would not allow me to do this. I missed 2 days of work due to stomach virus, upon returning to work, I was given two options. Quit on my own will, or be fired. So, I quit. Filed for unemployment, and it was awarded to me because the manager filed my paperwork as ""fired due to pregnancy."" Should have sued them."
bad,The company will soon be closing most or all of it;s stores. It was a good place to work though at one time. I had a great boss and loved working with/for her.
bad,"Was going out of business, the main manager said he was going to transfer me. I had to go away for training and came back to find out I wasn't transfered."
bad,"I had more trouble with the inspectors showing up for Sears clients. It was exciting to book  the furnace inspections. However, having deal with the customer complaints was not so good. I worked alone alot of the time. There was some good feedback from sears clients when all needs were met ,even if it took a few tries to get there."
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated over one customer, whom I sold two thousand dollars worth of appliances, delivery, accessories, complete maintenance plans, and opened a Sears card, after she telephoned the corporate headquarters in Illinois.  In Truth, I should have been retrained over the minor issue of a disgruntled customer's complaint."
bad,"I was in training for inside and outside sales. Doing a lot of phone work calling on existing leads. trying to generate more business."
bad,another typical day at work dealing with rude and irate customers. I at some point didnt feel like the job was for me until i actually was able to sit and talk to certain employees
bad,Pay here was good and hours were ok. Series of awful managers with no knowledge of the industry were always put in place. Customer service non existent.
bad,They will go a whole month without putting you on the scheduled. They will only call you in for 3 hours if they do put you on the schedule.
bad,I had worked for Sears for 2 yrs!! I'm the beginning it was great but when the store manager changed that when it went wrong. The new manager hates woman and thinks they should be seen and not heard and he has made that clear numerous times. My co-workers at the time were amazing but the store manager made everyone feel like we were nothing and doing nothing. He expects you to work long hours with little pay. They don't show any appreciation anyone unless you are in management. This Sears is a very smile in your face and do crooked behind you. If the management was to change it might be a better place
bad,Nobody lasts longer than six months and there are very good reasons for that. Management has high expectations but no ways to reach them. They are always hiring because more people quit than are hired and they do not listen to employees even though they desperately need the help. Steer Clear
bad,"Horrible work experience,company seems to be failing, they want you to slack in customer satisfaction.  The owners do not follow Sears policy and want to deviate from it, which in tern got the associates scolded by the general manager."
bad,"zero mutual respect in the workplace, management bullies everybody. they dont appreciate anything just want more more more"
bad,"No respect to its employees. Always understaffed. Great coworkers, but because of work environment people come and go."
bad,"no advance opportunities what so ever. managers didn't care about their employees at all. no raises wanted people to survive off of 7.75 and no hours. you could easily work 1day a week and only 4hours, that was normal"
bad,"Processing Associate 11/2013 – Present"
bad,"Recently, the company has been bought by a franchise owner, who has decreased our pay and benefits, which is why I'm looking for another job.  However, the best part of the job is my co-workers.  We have fun and enjoy each other, while being productive.  We are team-players, ringing-up sales for each other when needed.  A typical day consists of keeping up the appearances of the store, and my particular job is keeping the 'Crazy Deals' section (small appliances, tools & other discount items) stocked, priced & organized, which I enjoy and have had compliments on.  We've had many managers since I've been there.  Most have been very effective and fair, and customer-oriented, a quality I think to be very necessary. The hardest part of the job is standing around waiting for customers.  They have decreased since the franchise changes."
bad,"benefits suck, and that company doeent promote. dont work their"
bad,"Sears has a horrible way of saying hello in the morning as you tell someone about your accomplishments for a day prior they well get u down on some of the other metrics they certainly dont know how to grow a strong company so many of us have left sears due to few advancements and when u get a chance at an advancement and they get you all fired up they let you down time and time again and lots of excuses are in play when they go down .,"
bad,"This was a challenging place to work, people were rude and not helpful at all, management was rude and non caring overall would not go back to work there :("
bad,"this sound really mean but if you can avoid working for this company,  please do so. you are expected to jump through hoops (credit, shop your way rewards, protection agreements, purchase protect plans, keep your area clean, use the iheld/ tablets) and they pay you poorly. the management where i work openly show favortism and they do not know how to politely acknowledge employees. as a matter of fact, they are VERY quick to point out flaws but rarely commend you for a job well done. 90% of the people who work for this company that I know is is miserable and if i was there full time, I would be too."
bad,If you cam handle rude phone calls go for it!!! Boring job some of the workers are great. Cubicle setting and you don't have you own permanent cubicle.
bad,Very limited possibilities to grow with in the company. Typically there is a glass ceiling  for most of the associates.
bad,"Working with lawyers, city working and other powerful people, I did filing and typing, and also answering phones.  I learned everything that I know about how to run an office efficiently!"
bad,"I use to work for sears, I worked there for 5 1/2 years, I never had a problem until my last year. I had a problem with co workers and the management team did nothing but humiliated me because they all were friends. I eventually quit my job because the management team was very unprofessional. Every meeting my manager and I had in his office was not confidential. The management team in the lake mary call center is very unprofessional."
bad,Not the best place to work when the owner does nothing but lie to you !
bad,The environment is very laid back and fun but it depends on the day
bad,"I had amazing employees, but the store manager was horrible. I left due to him and than he got fired."
bad,Management very unprofessional. Focused on the wrong things. Goals not achievable.
bad,I enjoyed the people at Sears which makes the Company.!! I did alot of merchandising and learned alot.! Sears was a good Company. I wish it was still around as they gave you freedom to learn new things.
bad,"I love my job I love"
bad,"A typical day at work was busy for the most part. As a cashier, i worked in all departments, except for fine jewelry. In hardware, I learned how to repair a ratchet. Management was great. They did their jobs correctly. The culture of the workplace was do pleasant at times. There was always a lot of pressure about getting every customers email address and getting them to apply for credit cards. Things started getting bad for the company. The hardest part was being under pressure every day. Afraid of loosing my job because i could not pull the numbers they wanted. the most enjoyable part was the discount and the rewards combined."
bad,"This was an awesome place to work.. but management was not good to the workers at all! They would accuse workers of doing unethical things at work and when corporate was contacted, absolutely nothing was done"
bad,"They provided me with an opportunity to start from an entry level position without any experience, and work my way up to management. I would have loved to continue to grow within the company, but their financial instability didn't allow that."
bad,corporate is dumb they  just merged us to become sales support associate and now we have to do more things of other peoples job with the same 7.25 pay and same hours
bad,During the interview they made it sound really good and easy. But it’s one of the most stressful jobs ever. We have outbound calling people are constantly hanging up on you. But the company don’t care they still expect you to sale. The commission is horrible as well. They start you off at 12 but drop the pay to 10 after training. Don’t do it!!!
bad,"Counted the amount of money in all registers & wrote this amount down."
bad,Sears is a very competitive environment. Many the only down fall is the pay the pay is very minimum for the work that is being done.
bad,Sears was a great challenge we turned Sheffield around and no upper mgmt thanked us. Opened store closed store. Provided solutions for customers and associates
bad,"Sears cares about Sears' profits ONLY!!! Sears seemingly cares nothing about how employees feel nor about their suggestions about how to make things better and more comfortable for them. In fact, Sears tells all employees that if they say anything negative about Sears, they will be punished and/or terminated!!!"
bad,Not a good environment to work in.  The work was just to do work but there was no outcome or accountability.  There was a lot of passing the puck and no leadership.
bad,"El trabajo es todo el día, no pagan taxis en vta nocturna te vas por tu cuenta, no pagan bien las comisiones, te quitan el IVA y aparte un 11% extra para pagar a los administrativos. Llenas 16 solicitudes al mes y solo las pagan a 50 pesos c/u. El ambiente laboral es bueno con los compañeros, mi jefa no dejaba de gritarle al personal."
bad,"Pues el ambiente si está bien , los jefes también aprendes rápido pero en mi caso mi jefe era el que no merece ni una estrella era muy grosera y solo ponia menos puntos para que perdiera mi mes de prueba"
bad,"Unfavorable, Unfavorable, Unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable, unfavorable, terrible place to work, terrible management. It's easy to see why sears will not exist in the future"
bad,This was the worst place ever there was hardly a team I never understood anything that was happening I got blamed for everyone’s problems when I started working others would tell me to go do something stupid for them like go onto the floor & find the Manager On Duty (MOD) & then sent me back & fourth for hours then yell at me for listening to them
bad,Honestly the associates and customers (sometimes) is what makes it okay. Some of the management sucks-Fay- but other than that most associates are not trained PROPERLY at all. And there’s BARELY Cashier’s too which makes it all terrible. Some policies are not even lived up to and the materials needed for us to work all either suck or don’t work. (VERY OUTDATED)
bad,I HATED IT there. Barely got a lunch break and it was a COMMISSION job. Managers were super rude btw and they fired me because I called I had ask them not to put me on the schedule a month prior to my graduating they still did and when I didn’t show up they fired me.
bad,"Over worked you, managers slacked around, let you do all the work while they sat around talking amongst each other, were very childish, would make rumors and act like they were in high school. brought their life dramas into work. They either scheduled  you a lot of hours or no hours"
bad,I worked inside the Sears at the little Caesars. Nobody did work except a few people that actually wanted to. No body would show up and constantly call off and just not show up.
bad,I just had a manager from down under My manager had me in the blistering cold in a van with no heat this winter. Going to work was like going to downunder
bad,"Obviously, with Sears basically going out of business, you can imagine what it may have been like to work there.  The store itself was old and out of date.  The computer systems were as well.  The pay was OK.  My first manager was amazing.  The office manager and softgoods managers treated everyone horribly.  The second store manager went back on his word often.  I worked there during the K-Mart take-over, and it was time to go."
bad,"Sears was a terrible place to work! Too much workload for any one to be successful! The staff was rude and extremely prejudiced behind closed doors! I was responsible for 12 Department, I worked there before my disability. I feel the pressure helped make me ill! That Associates had no motivation. No raises, no healthcare and no room to advance! I wasn’t surprised when they closed a lot of their doors! Horrendous!"
bad,It horrible what happened to a great company.  The ceo didn’t care about sears and it’s employees.  Sears did t keep up with the times.  All the people who have 100 percent now have no jobs
bad,didn't like the work there it was always feeling like the managment had no clue what they were doing and the store manager would degrade you infront of other customers
bad,Well the only thing good I can say about working for sears is that my supervisor was awesome it was the store manager that I had problems with.Plus even if you worked 40 hrs you did not receive benefits
bad,"The managers were extremely hands off, and placed the blame on new workers when work didn't get done even if the older ones were the ones not pulling any weight. The store also had 0-5 customers daily, making earning commission nearly impossible."
bad,My job duty was to sell treadmills to people but there were rarely people shopping in the sport department. Most people shopped in the clothing or appliance department.
bad,"very stressful, not organized, greedy, don't care about clients or employees, favoritism, boring, keep changing protocol, hard to keep up, underpaid, understaff"
bad,Worked at the store when it was closing. Staff were in good spirits despite knowing that they were going to be out of work. I learned that I do not have the patience for retail anymore.
bad,"Bad managers that send you to do something you are not qualified for and they do not even help when you ask for it. Low pay and no benefits, no discounts on anything even counting clothes."
bad,"OK but could be better. The people are rude, they trust everything the company says whether they are right or wrong. Great change for the normal work everyone does"
bad,"While I worked at this company I was six months pregnant. The training with was easy and fun however, when you got on the floor managers would not take control in any sisuation. I was penalized for taking a day off (for a doctors appointment.) They basically will tell you that you are replaceable."
bad,"Manager was unreasonable.  I was shuffled off to a conference room, screamed at with fist banging onto the conference room table, all because I was 2 days late changing an ad wall due to construction."
bad,The store is no longer available to work at.  They closed it. I had a good manager at the time I was there but he left the company and it went down quickly.
bad,"Many people I worked with didn't care about their job, they'd sit in the office all day on the phone and management didn't care at all. People would not show up for shifts and the supervisor would make it a joke and laugh. So unprofessional and so unorganized, it's closed down now. it was at BCC."
bad,Personally seen them fire loyal long time employees days before their scheduled retirement. Did time at a few kmarts which is where most of the shady business happened.
bad,"Its okay for a beginner, but i don't feel like it is a life long job or career. Needs more hours. I didn't line this job. There was no room for improvement, i don't know if i would refer anyone to work for that company."
bad,The manager was awful to there employees. They didn't care about there wellbeing and was not professional in conversations. I would be careful choosing the location.
bad,"Avoid it, no seriously avoid it. I worked with Sears for 2.5 years while finishing college and it was nothing more than a way to keep myself fed. The company is a complete disaster."
bad,"No full time for anybody but, managers who are rude and nasty people. I would not recommend this place to anyone I cared about. Maybe my worst enemy.."
bad,"MCA - merchandise customer associate - was at an ok location, cashier lead and almost all cashier employees weren't the most skilled but the job wasn't too hard."
bad,I come in and l clock in to start my day. I find out what has the day been like with sales and what we need to do as a  team  for the day to meet corporate goal for certain products. The learn part of the company was all about numbers for sales.The hardest part of the job was getting customer to submit in getting warranties on products that was bought in the store. I enjoyed always meeting different peoples.
bad,Lack of interest in associates. I was coerced to push credit applications on each person that walked in the door. Management was only interested in how many credit applications were taken that day and not much else.
bad,"Bad working conditions, no regular work schedule, to many job requirements for very little pay,not enough help for the tasks,poor management,having to do everything for all the other employes"
bad,"when I started working  I was in the electronics department. I worked there for 3 months and coroprate shut it down. The store manager decide to put me on the sales team in the Appliance department . What she didn't tell me was I was getting paid on commission. for 2 months it was difficult trying to make a sell since the store was always empty, and customers always said ""I'm just looking "". However, if you did make a sale, you would get up to 15% on commission, and if the customer decided to change their minds and RETURN an item you would lose money that you worked hard on. Overall I would not recommend working at sears."
bad,Sears is no longer in Biloxi. They went out of business. Sears was not a good company to work for. The pay was awful and the hours were part time and all over the place.
bad,company will pay you very low and with very little room for growth. Company does not care about their associates at all. 401k is not existent there. Benefits suck.
bad,all products were overpriced hard to sell.  The compensation structure is good but all commission.  The company is unstable and I could never recommend to anyone.
bad,"Not the job you want if you have bills to pay, they say one thing and you end up with the opposite, not team work, not enough hours, messy everywhere!"
bad,I was told over and over that the call centers had nothing to worry and that our jobs were safe and not even 1 month later we are told that they declared bankruptcy and we would all be loosing our jobs
bad,sears seemed alright to work for however our store closed and got shutdown and they took away our commission checks and didn't give us much notice on closing their doors.
bad,I would go in around 6pm and unload the truck then work till done which was roughly round 10pm to 11pm. when the boxes came thru the belt I would unpack and sort by department. co-workers very friendly and happy to help.
bad,if you want a detective to call you in for an interrogation this is the place for you. After i gave my two week with the company i had been contacted by a detective because i was accused of stealing from a customer and my boss said i had a habit of doing so (which i did not and would never steal from someone) the partner i was with at the time actually had a drug addiction and was the one to steal the prescription drugs from the customer but I was accused of doing so.
bad,Poor location in sears store. A lot of sears stores were closing along with the Optical shop. Like the computer system for entering prescription very easy to navigate.
bad,The hardest part of the job was the management. Loading and unloading the trucks was okay. But the management will blame you for their screw up. Thanks.
bad,Long hours low pay no real work experience just fold and sort clothing very stressful for no reason no training they just throw you to the wolves as they say
bad,I worked in the office but the pay was only at minimum wage with very few hours available for scheduling. I really enjoyed my position and miss it but there was not enough money there to make it even worth the gas  used to go to and from work. The manager were great while I was there. There was not any part of my job that was bad and I loved going to work.
bad,"They pay you close to nothing and work you until you feel like you're going to fall over. The managers are horrible, their mean and crud, no help at all. No one that works there takes pride in their work no one enjoys being there and it shows."
bad,The store closed. Many more are and have followed. Not much more to say. This review is kinda pointless for this job. Glad I am forced to waste my time typing.
bad,The job was absolutely terrible because of the management. People would get blamed for problem they did not cause and it was a constant being yelled at and treated terribly.
bad,What can I say?  This place was run like a circus.  It's really no wonder why SEARS is going bankrupt.  No organization and complete lack of structure.
bad,Sears is probably out of business by now as they should be. Worst job ever. I hated it. Managers suck and the clients are rude. The store is a mess...
bad,there is a reason why this company is tanking. It promotes unqualified people to positions they do not know how to run. Which results in sub-par performance and a dive in customer satisfaction.
bad,"its uncomfortable working for managers who act like they don't want to speak to you. employees are nice to one another, the managers seem to look down others"
bad,they were not respect their employees and not clear about the salary and the tasks for each position I learned to work with more professional company to be creative with my team worker and reach my goals.
bad,By the time I left Sears the company started to die really quickly.  The management team I had at the end was very lazy and refused to come out of the office when a customer needed assistance.  I wouldn't recommend working for Sears now only because I don't see it lasting more than a 2 years from now.
bad,It was a great place to work but they closed with only a month notice.  I would not recommend because there is not another store in the Huntsville Area
bad,it was a far job getting there an home and it was a laid back job to work I loved to clean the stock room the company was great but my hours was the problems
bad,"Lots of cool people to work with, super cool customers. Ability to advance and get raises. Selling appliances was stressful as it was commission based only."
bad,Lo que no me gusto de este empleo fue el sueldo 1200 y el ambiente muchos chismes y eso es incomodo
bad,My work day consists of outbound calls to market and sale protection for home appliances. Applied a vary of sales approach to increase overall sales volume.
bad,"I think they're already closed."
bad,I would not recommend working at Sears these days. their days are numbered and are more focused on their sales than their employees. they had many opportunities to come back but were unsuccessful.
bad,"This company shows partiality to  certain people only-they behave as if you are important,when you enters the bldg, but already knew they are not going to give you the job. The only reason i applied for this job due to  close proximity  to my house.Need a change of management."
bad,I was my first retail and last retail experience. I started here in high school and it was great at first then it turned horrible when I switched store mangagers.
bad,"So once again indeed, this is a silly process that merely takes away my valuable time...it was a good work place I left before it closed a few years ago."
bad,"Only care about how much you are on the phone.  Customer service is terrible, and these upset customers are passed to the sales team to sell them on home improvements."
bad,"It helped to pay the bills. The hours were good, the work was continuous therefore it kept me busy. They didn't micro manage, we were given a job and expected to have it done."
bad,Sears Portrait Studios owned by CPI went out of business several years ago unfortunately.  Holidays were stressful but management was paid hourly so worth the 80 hour weeks!
bad,"The store gave little to no hours. The manger was not a good manager. I learned on what type of leader you should not be. My coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was that it was so slow, not very much room to learn."
bad,"Sears is likely the WORST place I have worked, as far as retail. They do not care at all about their associates, pay next to nothing, and everyone is part time because they don't want to give anyone any benefits. The company will soon run itself into the ground, since all they seem to care about is forcing associates to make people apply for their ridiculous credit cards and ""Shop Your Way"""
bad,A typical day was learning different kinds of customers. Interacting  Constantly with management as well as co-workers.
bad,this company does not take care of their employees. I got a position. No training was provided. My location got closed without notice and job placement. RUN!
bad,"this place was good to get me back into the job market and I will leave it at that, do not like the way the employees are treated"
bad,its a good place love working for sears and its always learning alot while working there they train their employees well otherwise have no complaints management is very attentive
bad,"good experience, nice people. I liked working there but the money was not great and had to move on to new things"
bad,"Productive and great people to be around co-worker wise but mangers not so well. After all, it was a great place to work at, quiet and nice."
bad,Credit recruiting practices questionable.  Tools and hardware typically was stocking and providing information and customer service to customers.  Learned alot about tools and hardware.
bad,"by far my worst experience working for a company - it may just be the location. there was no organization, respect, and support within management. They don't care about their employees at all."
bad,horrid experience. never worked for a company who underpays and treats their employees in a discouraging manner as sears does.
bad,Sears is a terrible company to work for. The pay is terrible and the favoritism between managers is utterly ridiculous.
bad,"Sears has lost appeal to most customers under (50) years of age. A lot of employees are ""holding on,"" hoping to make it to retirement."
bad,"A typical day consisted of: making sure my register was balanced, handling over a hundred customers, setting up credit card applications, and handling thousands of dollars in transactions all while maintaining a lovable personality. I learned the value of customer service and the effect good service can have on a customer. Management was only concerned about numbers and credit applications but my co-workers were very helpful when I had questions, particularly the ones that have been there the longest. The hardest part of the job was maintaining my bearing even when I had to deal with a particularly difficult customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of hours I was able to work to prepare me for higher demand jobs."
bad,"company was poor and with horrible values. Management needs work, and needs to get their facts straight about the plans they have for their appliances."
bad,"Sears is unprofessional, has rude managers, and a very unorganized staff. While the employees are friendly enough, the management leaves much to be desired (or at least it did when I worked there)."
bad,low pay no job security you are talked down on like you are scum yet they want you to bust your butt doing two or three jobs while barely making minimum
bad,This job made me appreciate every other company i have worked for. Management is rarely on the same page and only concerned with advancing their own carriers. Accountability is non-existent at any level. My friend was an assistant store manager for nearly a decade with very competitive numbers relative to sister stores in the region. Upper management kept promising a promotion to store manager. For three years they dangled it in front of him but when a store management position would open up they consistently hired from outside of the company.
bad,"The managers cared more about getting people to sign up for the Sears credit card than they did anything else. If you didnt get enough people to get credit cards, you got yelled at."
bad,"I had a wonderful time there I was there for 16 years so I encountered a lot of people management and co-workers, would not trade it for anything."
bad,"I work in the Home Improvement department on a daily basis I accept cash, credit transactions place orders for products on the internet for members and stock inventory on shelves."
bad,"Great company shipped and recieved merchandise, stocked it and located it. also merchandiser providing store with a quality look."
bad,"This company had very time under standing what costumer service is to the people. "
bad,"Sears used to be a great company, but it has fallen off in recent years.  This company needs to refocus its brand and get back to supporting its employees the way it use to."
bad,I was in charge of many different things since Sears is in downsizing mode and there were not many staff. I liked two of my projects there since I was completely in charge and I perform the best when I have full authority and own the project. Both projects were great success.
bad,"Open the store and try to up-sell every customer that walked in.  Daily quotas, and micro-managing made this job unpleasant."
bad,"Get credit card applications or lose your job, Ask every customer 20 questions or lose your job.  The company is not customer friendly but numbers friendly. Milk every customer for credit lines and rewards programs even if it means waiting in long lines for other customers."
bad,i ran into the staff acting very rude and unprofessional. the customers would curse and spit on you. I saw a lot of vagabonds and drug dealers.
bad,Met alot of great people working there! Overall management is not good and I would not recommend this as a place to work. No opportunity to move up in the company.
bad,"it was a good place to work, i learn to work with people to be a custormer survice, i had good co-worker working with me. there was no part hard to work in this job"
bad,"Completely under paid for the things I did even as a cashier, they say they'll move you and when you ask, they deny it up and down. The manager in the one I worked at was a horrid human being. Wickedly mean and completely biased towards workers. The hours are ridiculous. I was told that i would get 16-26 hours every week and only got 12. If you're a college student or plan to be, make sure they know before they hire you. After being hired, my boyfriend and I were both planning on going to college and told the woman that hired us. When it came time, she freaked out and told us that if we couldn't work the hours she wanted us to (we gave her the hours that we had class so that she could schedule around it) that she would fire us, and kept giving us hours during class. I also had problems with the store manager when I got injured while working. She tried to avoid the papers for workers comp and continued to blame me, even though it was their fault. All in all, one of the worst job experiences I had ever had. I don't even shop at kmart anymore."
bad,I hate it! They have no understanding for your outside like. If you have a kid that is sick they still want you at work. The manger told me to find someone to watch my kid!
bad,"Coming into work pulling up all my systems so i can help with the multiple  departments, within the building ,I love the fact i work in a very diverse  company  , however the management can improve their behavior .meaning lead by example ."
bad,"Atmosphere was very High School and cliqueish even with management and just wanting to show up and do your job and I mean actually do your job and be good at it, was apparently not enough."
bad,No room to grow. Company falling apart. When working at my store most of the time I was covering 5 different departments
bad,"gave them one star because i had too, but i would not work there. as a temporary worker for sears Canada. i was thoroughly not impressed"
bad,"Operating forklift on daily, lifting heavy appliances and following safe guidelines to ensure quality "
bad,Was a great all around worker thanks but if i could i wouldnt work there again they suckkkkkkkk lol!
bad,long hours...........alot of work.... great job for younger people
bad,"low pay and no respect to employees. I do not recommend to apply here,"
bad,"I loved working at the Call Center. My team was great, I had the best supervisor in the department and the training we received was phenomenal."
bad,didn't like the fact that I was paid as a part time employee there but I was working like a manager and had a managers postion
bad,Not the best place to work. Good first job and register experience but unhealthy work environment.
bad,No one knows whats going on the the other employees don't really care about the job. they make it harder then it should be.
bad,You will work more hours than you'd think for almost nothing and at the end of the week accomplish almost nothing.
bad,Low pay and poor work conditions make Jack a dull leader. Buildings need a face lift. Lots of folks jumping ship.
bad,"If you don't get credit card enrollments as a cashier, you are nobody. You do not recieve any type of hours or benefits."
bad,management is immiture and petty. did not like working here.
bad,A typical day at Sears is counting the money that you start of with in the box. The day consists of taking customers' payments and giving them change. The managers are always getting you on task and the co-workers are quiet.
bad,As a retail employee this job was not flexible in hours and managers micromanaged employees.
bad,"I have been a Manager for approximately 14 years and when my family and I relocated, I decided I didn't want to be a salary manager anymore so I could spend more time with my children and husband. So I accepted a position with Sears. It truly was horrible. I worked more hours being an hourly ""Pricing and Merchandise Lead"", at least 52 hours a week. I was told I would have a ""team"" of my own to build and help me... that never happened! They never hired anyone for me and even judged one girl that applied for the position saying she was too big to hustle to do the job... Even though when the job duties were described to her, she expressed interest and was absolutely sure she could do it well... but because of her size, they wouldn't hire her!!! I was furious with Sears! So, since I had no team, I did ALL of it on my own. Yes, even during the Holidays, of course I worked 60 or more hours a week to keep up with all the resets and ad sets that needed to be done. My weekly schedule was changed daily, without even asking if I had already made plans or not. The Assistant Manager was a complete jerk! He would only want to talk to customers and if you had a question as an employee... Wow, he was rude, arrogant, and belittled you until you felt like a two year old! Unreal!! I completely understood why their store turnover rate is as bad as it is! The Store Manager and the Operation Manager were actually pretty great and very knowledgeable, always ready to answer a question, without cutting you down. However, when anyone would express concerns about how the Assistant Manager was, it was"
bad,I was only there for two months for the holiday season. It was alright; just like any other retail place of business.
bad,I worked as a cashier so I moved to different areas. I loved putting the returns back because it gave me something to do.
bad,"worked in five departments"
bad,"I learned that if a company doesn't work together as a team, that a company will fall apart."
bad,"•    Also: warehousing Clerk – shipping, receiving and distribution"
bad,great place to work everyone loved everyone. and supervisors were great also
bad,"The company was going out of business and didn't want to tell the employees so they started laying all the good employees off and then 2 months later the whole location was shut down, but we were never notified that the company was going under so that was the worst part, plus we lost a lot of customers due to being short staffed and never having things in stock. Overall I would probably never work for SEARS again."
bad,typical retail environment. Easy work. Not respectful of personal schedule. Co-workers decent.
bad,"There is such disappointing management.To many examples running threw my mind to make the point. No recognizing people that do excellent work. They, in my opinion take advantage of lower educated people. Starting at minimum wage. And expect more and more, Never getting raises. I know employees that have been with the company 20,30 years! And only making 2 to 3 dollars more an hour.In a day you might get 3 to 4 jobs to do within the store,this is in addition to what you are to do in the first place. And when not done you are talked to like a child and put down personally. The people that has been there a while i noticed just either ignore this or it affects them to push their self over and over trying to get that small words of ""GOOD JOB""! I myself, have at this time no other job aspects.So i stay till something else is available. Would only recommend this job to high school or retired. They are very understanding about tardies and call offs as no one ever gets fired for it."
bad,"Hours suck and pay is not good at all."
bad,It was stressful and I did not have a lot of benefits. I had good co-workers but the management was lacking.
bad,Overbearing management and horrible pay. My boss was a tyrant and we were forced to stay past our scheduled times if the store was not up to their standards.
bad,"Sears is a nice place to work if you're looking for experience in the sales world. It teaches you how to make sales, engage with the public and challenge you to do your best."
bad,they brought me on in the stance of having to further my training and out 2 officers in which they were investigating for fraud in charge of training me therefore I didn't get the proper training and then they terminated me without possibility of rehire. I think that is very much unfair and that the personal over LP at that time was wrong for doing that to me.
bad,"Boring, old look to the store. The employees are generally very down, and pessimistic. No real room for advancement, pay was horrible, management was worse. "
bad,"Sears Outlets store has appliances that are mustly use purchase from home depot, Lowes, and any where else were damaged and some are new. Sales them and because they are used make the customer but a protection agreement. And keep all  these used dirty appliances looking like new in the outlet. Sears has very unrealistic goals for it store managers. Sears Outlet store are a horrible  place to work.  Before you take a job as a Store Manager for a Sears Outlets. Ask this how question how many store manager has that position before you had it. And I need to say no more. Good Luck you will not last  "
bad,worked there for 15 yrs and one day your job has been eliminated you have 10 minutes to clean out your desk and turn in your keys.
bad,"Fun workplace environment. I enjoyed going to work there. Unfortunately, the location closed"
bad,Too stressful for the amount of pay given. Employees who worked for the company for over a decade were treated bad and weren't given an opportunity to grow.
bad,"The pay is horrible especially for all the pressure it is to be a cashier. The commission for a cashier is $2 or $3 for each credit app you do. Getting credit apps are almost impossible simply because all the vets know how to swindle people into signing up, some people say no right off the bat, some already applied and said no. Management has favorites and they are usually the one's who get the most credit app. Anyway to make a long story short the whole staff is crooked, from Human Resources on down. The people there are so messy, even the guys are catty. It can be a very stressful work environment. You constantly feel like you need to have your defense mechanism up; and it's simply not worth all the hassle to get a job there. I worked at the gretna location and I heard sears is closing stores & if so I pray every night this one gets the boot 1st : )"
bad,"It was a great experience as my first call center job. I learned a lot more than expected. The most enjoyable moment about Sears, is that the customers were the best. I maybe had some that was a little harsh, but I got through it."
bad,This job was a waste of time and service and money...... Alll the customers hated when I spoke to them about the products because half of them couldnt afford them.
bad,worked in mens wear fitting suits. Did not enjoy this job. Very slow with sales and traffic.
bad,Everything about working in this place sucked the pay which was 4.00/h plus comission sucked. thank god it was a high school job otherwise i wouldn't be able to be working here and survive.
bad,"Managers dont care about customers, they dont care about their employees either. Hours are split between too many employees. Customers aren't handled with respect or with their needs in mind."
bad,unorganized..poor management..poor training..didnt learn much at all.
bad,I have never worked in such a hole. Do not seek employment with this company. Employees have no value
bad,I didnt really learn anything new working at sears i pretty much know alot.
bad,For my first job I was treated different. I believe i was discriminated because of my young age.
bad,"I was management at one point, and I didn't even like it then. Too much drama."
bad,"a great place to work however they are lacking the organizational skills that would ensure success. They have cut back all employee hours,yet still hire reps for all departments."
bad,"sears need to adapt 21 century management policies, review current emloyees with great skill assessments for promotions, review policies on micro managment, maintain current and past customers to access their needs"
bad,"I HATED working here. the people are rude, the staff is rude, the pay is horrible and the store is trashy."
bad,I had a job with Sears Auto Center...went from 40 hours down to 9 hours a week. Upper management has cut hours due Sears cutting back on hours and closing stores across the country. They continually advertise for help knowing fully well they aren't hiring let alone working their employees their promised hours.
bad,"Great management,  nice coworkers, great job training, safe environment to work in. Great company to work for at first, then there were way to many layoffs."
bad,High pressured sales job. Not enough workers and too many hours required to work. It was unorganized when I first started. They wanted me to clean up the mess of the previous manager.
bad,This place is a joke insurance is too high you do not get 40 hours management likes to play games with your future do not waste your time find yourself a future not this place worst place I ever worked
bad,Responsible for the coordination and accurate execution of Kmart/Sears’s national circular advertising
bad,"variations in schedules"
bad,When working at Sears as a cashier you can get fired for something that is not under your control AKA Shop Your Way Rewards and not getting enough credit applications. Shop Your Way Rewards is based upon your customers willingness to join or is already a member. If your numbers are low you will get yelled at by the managers and get points going towards you getting fired again for something that is not under your control. Along with that is the Sears Mastercard. As a cashier you're required to ask every customer if they want a Sears Mastercard. That isn't that bad right? WRONG! If you don't get any within a certain time that goes to points at you an honest hard worker getting fired! And after working at Sears I know why they're failing as a company....
bad,"The only issue about Sears, is that they say that they are having a big hiring event. They say that they promote within. How!!!!!!, that can promote within. If they FIRED my team manager, and told her that there have to shorten down team manager's because, they were to many managers on the floor working!!? - Well, that is the best company to grow......humm!"
bad,Great place to work for which it hadn't closed own because I would still be there the atmosphere was relaxed yet everybody got their work done I loved the location.
bad,"Sears, bar none was the place to shop. They have allowed Big Box stores, and Now Sears is losing stores and losing customers. In the three times, I was employed there, it was an excellent part time job."
bad,Great company to learn the ropes of supply chain for entry level professionals. The company is not financially in a place to seek long term employment.
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. The management is crazy. There should not be 6 managers at this store. There are 11 cash registers and only like 7 work.. That is so unacceptable. There were rats and mice and it was dusty and very flithy.
bad,"I would usually work between 2-7 hours depending on the day. I barely got any work at all throughout the entire time I worked there, they promised me 15-30 hours and one week out of the entire summer I got between that amount. I loved the customers and interacting with them but hated trying to sell credit cards to every single customer. My co-workers trained me very well and were informative on what I had to do. For the most part, my managers did a good job on running the store."
bad,"I was the District Manager for six stores. My day consisted of taking complete control of inventorys, staffing, scheduling, hiring, daily, weekly, and monthly reports."
bad,It is good to work at on a store level but the rules of what we have to do from corporate level change in an almost  hypocritical way. My managers were great but you can tell they struggle with the problems from corprate
bad,"The company was amazing to work for, however due to the fact the company itself is slowly going out of business, the cutbacks on everything from merchandise to employees are intense."
bad,General customer service. As a cashier I  rung up customers did returns and credit applications. I learned patience. The hardest part was only when there was not enough help. The most enjoyable part was the friends I made through co-workers and customers
bad,"Do your job immediately don't sit around unless your  on lunch break,get paid and go home. I've learned that you manager is not going to always nice to you if you need a hand or help with something.The hardest part of the  job was making things stay  in place before the store was full of customers.The most enjoyable part of the job was hanging out with my co workers on lunch break and getting the job done ."
bad,There is not a lot of business through out the day so there is a struggle to meet the requirements for your job. The associates are friendly and helpful. The store is looking good and well stocked. They don't have a lot of things that they did before over the years. The hours that they are open are always changing.
bad,"j aime travaille a cette endroit."
bad,"I was a cashier for the max, two months. I was aware of selling credit card apps, but unfortunately for me, in a way?, because I was told no. I lost my job. I was friendly, and worked well with others, I was on time, and I did what I was asked. If it hadn't been the push for credit card apps I would have been sure to stay. Was hounded for the remaining weeks and was told to be terminated before the ACTUAL date I had to go into HR and say my good-bye. I was asked to resign, which I said no. I made them fire me because I was not quitting, I was being made to quit, which I do believe is FIRING SOMEONE. So to those who can tough it out, go for it. Just make sure you can con as well as you can breathe."
bad,"The company itself sucks, they except you to do way too much than what their paying you."
bad,great team enjoyed working with other and meeting sales goals as a team
bad,"Providing excellent customer service to each customer individually. I learned that each customer is the most important part of the business. The management was encouraging and giving. The co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was resolving complex issues between customer and company, and the most enjoyable part of the job was giving the best of me to each customer individually to meet and exceed each need"
bad,I really enjoyed the fast paced retail setting. I learned how to work with different kinds of people.
bad,"I like work with the people, It's fun to work with customers, and provided them with support, and I like to work hard to get the job done."
bad,En cuanto a poder crecer laboral mente esta muy bien tienes muchas oportunidades
bad,"Not possible under the current managerial direction. Heartbreaking to watch after 10 years. A warning to retail: if all you want to do is satisfy investors, you will end up hurting your employees and customers."
bad,they give you long hours with a really short break it's a break every 5 hours and it's 30 mins which feel like 5 mins and then work feels like years the team is very helpful but management is not I feel lost on what I'm supposed to be doing
bad,"Iztel no sabe reclutar ni cuidar gente, por ello se le va el personal rapifo"
bad,The Sears included the Above the Line concept in order to decrease any or all complaints and shut the employee up. It maintained a follow or be removed concept.
bad,This job was beyond garbage beyond disappointment and beyond lower than anything i have ever had. Managers straight up disrespectful we had like managers for every department well the one assigned to me I have gotten so many complaints only to not have ANYTHING to do about it only to waste my time walking back and forth to the office because customers were so angry with her. The pay was so low I couldn't even afford McDonalds dollar menu.
bad,A typical day at sears is standing for hours folding and unfolding clothes to the same music playlist. This job is perfect for people who prefer the less exciting things in life.
bad,"The overall work was easy, its fast paced but management didn't work well with its employees. There has to be some communicating between managers and employees. There was favoritism and ill will for everyone else. Find a location with great people. If not transfer or just find something better."
bad,hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo buenas prestaciones pero no tienes vida en el area de seguridad por que como es aparte de la sucursal los auditores prepotentes no cumplen con los pagos de tiempo si doblas turnos y ni con pago en $ debe de haber disponibilidad de personal pero la empresa no agradece ese punto
bad,"Favoritism to certain employees. They would have set hours (Opening - Monday - Friday) and then the hours that was left they would want those sprinkled around.  Lunch time would be hard to get, they wouldn't  want you to leave the register and go to lunch. Not a fair place. They don't give employees a discount."
bad,I currently work there. The training here is horrible and the management is not too great either. I don’t knkw how to do some of the most basic tasks because of the training here
bad,"The first job for me with the minimum wage in the US, it was fun to learn how to speak English while working. Very nice experience overall but the salary was very low for me."
bad,I used to love working at Sears until they got a new ceo and then the company went downhill.  They don't really care about their employees and no paid time off for part time.
bad,It was not the best. security was never on the ball. The place was filthy. Never got paid holidays. The entire experience was the worst part of my life.
bad,"management sucked. no benefits and no hours. I would cry everyday before starting my shift, thats how much it sucked. super slow since everyone thinks they are going out of business"
bad,A typical day at work consists of working in a hot sweaty warehouse and have to unload trucks full of refrigerators washers dryers etc. with a hand truck
bad,"Folks on the floor tried to make it seem like it was a great place to work but it wasn't. Just wasn't for me not what I wanted to do. I was working three jobs at the time so it needed to be good, not."
bad,"Terrible, worse even now that Sears is going under. The managers will work you hard without any acknowledgment and still ride you hard about how you are not doing your job, while manager does nothing, but sit in his office."
bad,Sears seem to be suffocating. It is dying a slow cruel death. Mass layoffs in 2014 with the expectation to increase production. This is a service industry where people are mandatory to produce. This is not OTC sales where people are needed to cash out a customer.
bad,Shame to see a once super power in the retail industry fail under poor leadership. do not need to express more thought about company . You can keep up with all the changes through media
bad,"It was the same thing everyday. Check your metrics, input the members you helped. Then sell, sell sell and if you didn't get the protection on your sales, you got pulled to the side by the manager for them to tell you what you are doing wrong"
bad,You have a store manager that gives away profits so your store is NOT successful yet the company brings in another manager who makes a profit yet the company bring back the original store manager and closes the store in less than 6mth.  Employees had NO clue store was going to close.  Sears had just did a big remodel in the store.
bad,Malos salarios y malos horarios mal trato al personal.
bad,"There is no proper training from managers, I was trained by someone who had been working there for 1 week.  Their equipment is very poorly maintained and no one fixes anything.  I requested new ink for our printer about 3 times because our receipts were printing blank and no one ever tended to that.  Overall they do not seem to care about giving their employees good equipment and proper training.  It was very stressful trying to work with broken tools."
bad,"Very stressful job, you are given too many things to manage on top of doing what you were actually hired for, Repair Technician. There are better jobs"
bad,"Work life balance was not good.  Job was Monday through Friday,but I had to work some weekends to catch up on paperwork and calls. My average week hrs was close to 55 or 60.  Extremely stressful work environment not knowing if your job was going away due to restructuring."
bad,It was a mellow work environment seeing as the department I worked in lacked a lead for 2 years after one of our leads quit due to being overworked and underpaid. we had leads come and go none could replace our previous. The managers are wrapped up in there own world and have a bit of attitude issues the young girls who are MCAs and cashiers are always gossiping as well as dating other sears employees mainly the boys who work in the warehouse. Wasn't very welcoming work place to be honest I worked there for about 5 years wouldn't go back.
bad,"It was very, very unorganized. Although the company (as well as many other Sears) are going out of business, the employees were nice. I am glad I no longer word there though."
bad,"Back in 1993 in Savannah GA I had a work experience with the sears there and they had a superior compensation, work life balance, and management team with superlative training and excellent benefits. This time was a complete disappointment from that initial experience on all counts."
bad,sears is continuing to close stores because of poor management decisions and lack of properly training new associates. sears roebuck always stood for quality products and great service. while management is losing more money each day no one is trying to change the culture back to well trained great customer service and the product line has no quality control in place. like most retail the job takes away any chance of a balanced life because of constant schedule changes. there are no benefits until after 1 year. if sears wants to survive they will have to change how they treat their employees and customers.
bad,"Very slow work day, if busy stayed busy."
bad,I would not recommend no one to work there the contractors are not good they pay late and they don't believe the worker's and some customers are not good ones
bad,They required cashiers to push credit card applications.  Hours depended on it.  No real support from management.  And no real opportunity to go up in company due to uncertainty of business.
bad,Wonderful place to work for. Hours are good and the environment is nice. Will work with school schedules and families. Overall this place is pretty good
bad,In the last 5 years in store shopping has deteriorated do to online shopping. Eliminating sales help is not good for customer service.Poor employee morale.
bad,"Not the best store in terms of management and benefits or employee treatment, they pick and choose on a random basis and give hours to whoever they like and fire and let employees go without reason."
bad,"working at sears holdings, I feel there isn't a lot of advancement opportunity and stores keep closing more and more. I feel they do not have friendly consumer policies is a reason for a lot of closures and struggles company has."
bad,The employees work hard but don't get paid enough with the management team in having the lack of training needed. The expeditions of each employee is high then what the management team can even offer for guidance. This is a retail store and we all know that it is tough to deal with customers on a daily bases.
bad,Low inventory so hard to sell things when you never have them or can't order them. Management or leaders have horrible customer service with customers and employees. A lot of requirements for little pay and they don't give out many hours. Training is poor..pretty much expected to just know things and you're treated like you are stupid if asking questions.
bad,"It's on it's way out-- and the singular piece of evidence I bring to support that is when they brought a new store manager in to save the business, and he ends up having an affair with another manager on site."
bad,Muy mala actitud para los que son de oficinas no pagan hrs extras y haces de todo y sin sueldo
bad,"I worked here while going to school and it was fun to learn a new skill, which I had no previous training in. I am grateful for my time there because it has helped me and my family save hundreds of dollars by me doing my own automotive repairs."
bad,"There was no room for job advancement, no communication among mgmt and employees. I learned alot only because I schooled myself on product information. Not a great place to work."
bad,They use to make us sell credit cards to the customers just so we can get hours. The main manager was really man and treated his staff like we were all highschool students. also they don't pay really good
bad,Management needs improvement. If management would like employee to be ideal staff the must treat others with respect and all be on board and on the same page.
bad,"SEARS is not what it once was. "
bad,"I was not informed in the interview, or in the training that part of my job was getting ""numbers"" sales numbers, ""shop your way rewards"", credit card applications, and those annoying ""tell us how your experience was"" surveys.  Once I was informed it was already too late, and my numbers were substantially low."
bad,"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars for my overall rating is because the people who worked there are really some of the best people I've ever met. Other then majority of my coworkers being great to work with this job was horrible. Kmart over works their employees for the lowest of minimum wage by the state with no pay raise unless you work at the service desk or become a manger, then you get a whole 50¢ raise. At my specific location the store could not seem to get it together. My store refused to use air conditioning during the summer and heat during the winter, along with a long list of complaints I can literally say this is the saddest excuse for a business. As a cashier there were many times I would be the only one on the registrar with a line wrapping all the way to the front desk with absolutely no help from anyone including the four or five people who stand and talk at the service desk. Even when not working by myself it seemed there was never enough employees, during our most busiest seasons there would still only be two or three cashiers every three or four hours. Honestly this place is the biggest joke, as stated before they will over work you and still pay you 7.25 with no raises. If you're looking for a job stay clear of this place!"
bad,the work load is actually very stressful due to the managers. the security team just sits in the back of the store. the cashiers do a lot for only 7.25 an hour
bad,Customers come first that's the motto. Our goal is to make sure the customer leaves with the right product to do a successful project.
bad,The company is still stuck back in the 1980's when it comes to pay and benifits. gool luck advancine in the company. Bad company to work for end of story
bad,Poor management and cronyism.  Management here is only for self-preservation and undermining whoever is above them in order to secure that position for themselves.
bad,"No comment, other than the store I worked at was really just a playground for employees. Stuff hardly got done, management never was around, and when dealines came around the stress level was over the top."
bad,"its a challenging company, if you like dealing with problems and love having headaches this is the job for you, my co workers were great best team i ever have, we all look out for one another but upper management seems to try and halt our progression"
bad,"If you want to work for a company that truly lives in the past, does not offer salary increases and takes away any attractive benefit, this is the place to work."
bad,Staying busy by checking out customers learning how to deal with all different types of customers was hard sometimes but you had to get through it with a smile. It was a fun place to work at it was neat to see al the different types of things people would go and buy.
bad,Management at the time was poor.  Communication with employees only had one side:  They talked while you listened.  Manager at the time was not willing to work with my schedule as a college student and single parent.
bad,Sears home services is on an up and down roller coaster and they are always changing this or changing that I did not even get a raise after two years and had no choice in being transferred to another location.
bad,I just worked a seasonal job in the photo lab and it sucked so bad! We had people walking out left and right. One day the manager didnt come in and had me a seasonal employee run the whole place... it was a nightmare i had to walk out..
bad,"All I can say is, it was a job till I found a better one. Place is a joke. Only if your hurting for work, I would go there. no, not really....."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is opening up the doors counting money before opening up doors, making sure my area was clean. I didn't learn anything from management or co-workers they were okay to work with. their no hard  part working there and not a fun place to work."
bad,"Do not work at sears. There are very few redeeming, qualities. Poor structure and operational standards. Unappreciative of associates and work ethic. No payroll to provide for exceptional service. However the bright side is a staff of exceptional people on the ground floor."
bad,Sears as a company is horrible. Very poor management. They are unorganized and discouraging unless they're asking you to push for their Sears credit cards. The company gives away its clothes basically for free because the prices on the merchandise are hardly ever correct. Customers always ask when will Sears be closing down. There are NO opportunities for advancement. The store manager is hardly ever there and does nothing to motivate you. The employees are hardly ever happy to work there. There are so many cons to this company. This company is also not flexible with your availability. Choose wisely if you are trying to make Sears as a career. Not a great place. I'll give it another year before its eventually closed for good.
bad,"you are only allotted 30 minutes to come into a customers home, figure out what is wrong, fix it, and sell them a protect plan. You are required to sell $100.00 worth of PA's a week."
bad,Sears is not a great company to work for. Anytime a company will terminate you for something you can't control such a customer wanting to sign up for a credit card or Shop your way card and they tell you no several times but you are penalize for it that's something you can't control that but Sears upper management think you can . Don't waste your time or gas money it's not worth it.
bad,"it just wasn't a good place to work never was fun it was just not a fun place to work, breaks were short and never timed correctly, management only cared about themselves"
bad,"dis organized"
bad,"I worked for K-mart a Sears holding company. I worked very hard while some employees stood around and talked in groups or used their cell phones on the floor, ignoring customers.Supervisors who were unqualified to manage, openly showing favoritism."
bad,"I had alot of fun working here.  The staff was great, i met some really good friends.  My team was the best we had fun and we worked well with each other"
bad,I really liked the job but not the pay or the commission rate.
bad,"I found it difficult to advance and impossible to earn hours despite achieving goals in metrics (such as credit applications, rewards enrollments). Felt unappreciated by most management, even when efforts to improve performance succeeded. Co-workers were very tight-knit, and very friendly."
bad,"Cashing out customers, helping customers"
bad,"Im in the call center answering escalated calls, The moral in the call center is horrible because everyone is always looking over there shoulders, afraid there going to loss there jobs. You have 10 mins in a 8 hour shift for bathroom breaks and if you go over that you can be wrote up. The managers don't know anything and will throw you under the bus to save there own job. This is a company were you don't advance by what you know but who you know. We always say that undercover boss should come to the call center, they just may shut us down....."
bad,"A typical day at work was ringing up customers and try to get them to apply for a sears credit card. I learned how to work a cash register again. Management was very lazy, especially my manager. Some of my co-workers was nice and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was to get customers to apply for a credit card. The most enjoyable part of the job was to please the customer; even it was being able to give them two dollars off of their purchase."
bad,It's like a colt at that place. There is no chance for management. They have their own management clan. The general manager there think that he is god. He wil embarrass you in front of the whole call center just to prove his point. Also the team managers favor their emplyees. The same rules are not applied to everyone.
bad,Approaching customers with home improvememt and scheduling date and time to speak to a sales person for additional information for new windows and panels in their home.
bad,"This was my first foray into retail (and my last), and while I enjoyed interacting with the customers and trying to help them the rest of the job left a bad taste in my mouth. My co-workers were not happy and the management was rarely available."
bad,"Sears,,,, Is a company.....that is all...  It was strictly commission based and I held up until the economy started declining and product was changing.  Warranties were not upheld"
bad,"When I was hired the store manager had promised me a sales position in their electronics department once my seasonal position ended, however they  blew their budget a week into my seasonal position and let me and every other seasonal employee go without providing any other job. To top it all off, they had the HR person tell me i was let go a long with a loss prevention person, when I attempted to talk to the store manager I was escorted out of the store by a loss prevention associate, and the best part was my own mother worked there at the time as a full time associate."
bad,"Not to much growth opportunity, and managers do not recognize the hard work that is done."
bad,"Alot of down time."
bad,"My coworkers made my work day easy. We as team workers worked together to figure out a lot of problem that were unanswered my management. I don't feel as if the manager are as interactive with coworkers as they are with other managers. "
bad,Extremely busy place to work at.Learned how to do sales. Management was motivating to guide employees fast.Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude costumers. Those days I treat the costumers nice.I enjoyed taking photographs.
bad,My work day includes helping customers  make the best decision when it comes to servicing their vehicles. I learned how to talk to customers and handle certain situations. My co workers are fun to work with being that I am new to the department they are always willing to help me. The hardest part of my job is making sure that my knowledge about my cars is very accurate so I can communicate with the customers on a better level. Management in the auto center is very well they care about the associates almost as much as they care about their job which is very important to me because it makes me feel that I am truly part of a team. the enjoyable part of the job is learning about cars in which I gained a sudden interest.
bad,The Store in Milford Ct was the worst place I have ever worked in my life. Getting a raise was like pulling teeth. The management were not trust worthy. The enviroment was High School like. 
bad,I learned how to handle customers. This job was the hardest job I ever worked for. There was no joy into this job.
bad,At sears I felt like i was getting pushed to sell the customer something that they really didn't need but if you didn't you would get fired for not meeting your quota. 
bad,I went to work and did my job. I was very reliable and I made it to work on time never really called off. Did what I was asked to do with no problems.
bad,helping customers out and maintaining a clean work area. unsupportive co workers 
bad,"Job is easy but absolutely no trust from management. Sometimes very unfriendly, random behavior from upper management."
bad,Not the company it was several years ago. There was a time when Sears took care of its peaople.
bad,It was okay for the moment really didnt like my managers or some of my coworkers very bad attidudes
bad,Not enough work coming in for 5-6 Mechanics on duty. 90% of work coming in was oil changes or free inspections which did not make it enjoyable to work there. But the hours/schedule was pretty decent.
bad,I had worked at Kmart in Atascadero for 7 months and the moment the store manager had changed everyone began to be fired who had worked there for more than 10 years and pushed anyone else to quit. I recommend not even bothering to apply until Store Manager leaves.
bad,"Warehouse general work. I learned nothing to help me in the job. Management didn't care if I like or hated the job. Did not like any of the co-workers. Working without overhead assistance, (forklift, ladders). When I found a better job."
bad,"Interacted with customers and employees for sales, problems solving, approvals and locating of merchandise. Price set up, display set up, inventory, opening and closing of store, and coordinating / supervising of projects"
bad,Worked for Sears for sears for 5 months it was the worst job I have ever had. The management is poor its just not a comfortable place to work.
bad,"Short hours, taking care of customers issues, co-workers are good to work with but management is not very organized."
bad,I love photography so I thought I could learn a thing or two. There was hardly any training and you work off commission when you sell the portrait packages. I was a key holder right away which I thought I won't be just seasonal. They scheduled me right before Christmas and never got another schedule. They called me only to get my key back which by then I was happy to do.
bad,"I was only here a few months, and I did not like it. This is not a company that I could grow and mature with."
bad,Being very productive and have better customer service skills
bad,a lot of work for 7.55
bad,The people are nosey and in your business. They do not care about anything outside of work. The also set unrealistic goals for the organization.
bad,"Working from 7am to almost 8pm 6 days a week was difficult. Especially since we were paid salary, all the work per day was only $150; at the beginning of when I began working there at least. After only several months, our salary was decreased to $100 per day. Shifts were very long and pay was not great."
bad,This work place was just a job through college. I am really trying to get in my legal profession
bad,"I opened and closed store, handled all money in both cash registers, sold merchandise, set sales, customer service, all the duties of manager without manager salary. The business has a very high turn over rate of employees. I did the very best I could possibly do without getting any advancement or raise. If I was with another company I would have gotten a managment title and more compensation."
bad,"didnt really learn much except to force people to sign up for credit apps, asked for extra hours several times only to be denied. then when i picked up a second job to make up for my low pay they fired me with out telling me why and tried to make it look like i quit"
bad,I learned that Sears is about to divest the Sears-Kenmore operation to free-standing stores.
bad,"This job is commission based but ther rarely have items in stock, therefore it is difficult to make a living."
bad,"If it sounds too good to be true it normally is. I started this job right out of college after being highly recommended by a friend who did an internship with Sears Holding. I was to receive training, a nice salary, insurance and a solid 40 hour work week. After communicating with a recruiter online and via phone I was hired. After my first day I should have known what I was in for. My boss who I had contacted prior to my arrival ranted about how she had no hand in me being hired and didn't even know I was coming prior to me calling her. During my six month ""training"" I worked 50-55 hours and sometimes my off days. I contacted my recruit asking about the maximum 40 hours of work I agreed to and was threatened to be fired when I came to work the next day for ""telling"" which wasn't at all the case. When it came time for me to take my training assessments my supervisor gave me the answers and sent me back to work. To a lazy person that might have been fine but to someone that actually wanted to learn it was dishonest and disrespectful. To add insult to injury I had no insurance and didn't find out until after my first dentist visit which was AFTER I talked to HR and they assured me I was covered by MetLife. When I told her I wasn't covered she gave me a shrug and that was that. Everyday I came to work trying to push myself and do better but eventually I crumbled and quit. If I knew it would be so difficult to find a job I would have tried to stick it out longer. On the bright side a year later I was able to join a class action suit against the ""training program"" and I was compensated"
bad,Wouldn’t wish this job on anyone. If your a part of the management team you are expected to work whenever they need you too and will work 16 hours a day at times. Not much of a work/ life balance.
bad,solo fue como 5 minutos ya que el gerente no tenia tiempo fue muy rapido no hay la seriedad en esta compania
bad,"Would not recommend Sears to be your first job as it was for me. There was a lot of favoritism. They would cut your hours based on how many people you got to apply for a credit card. Also didn't get any type of notice that I was being ""let go"" they just stop scheduling me."
bad,No communication or go forward strategy. Management is non existent. there is no future here. There is no loyalty here anymore just one person out to strip assets for his personal gain
bad,Should give the management Seminars on leadership and encouragement to employees! Management should treat employees with respect professionalism and most of all should lead by example!
bad,"Since I left Sears this location closed. Matter of fact I believe all locations have closed and only online store remains open."
bad,the workplace is okay but the managers and the management of the store is very difficult and rude and they don't care about anything but themselves they don't know how to talk to people they will talk to you like you slow and also they will get mad at you because they expected you to get things done within an hour
bad,"I was a janitor for them. I had a list of what had to be done daily, weekly, and monthly. They would make me do things outside of the job requirements."
bad,"Sistema de crecimiento muy cuestionable, mala dirección, bastante presión a los empleados, ventas nocturnas que solo amplían la jornada y si no hay ventas no hay retribución alguna."
bad,They pay minimum wage plus commission based on sales however you can leave on Monday with for example 1000 in sales and commission and Tuesday not ha e a great day and Wednesday your commission can be only 65.00 because you didn’t get sales the previous day! That actually happened to me and lots of others! You’re penalized when you receive a non sale call they mark it against you because the customer picked the incorrect number option! Training was inadequate and left us in prepared for all we had to go through! Unless you need a quick job I don’t suggest this job! Just sayin
bad,"The experience as a whole is unpleasant no job security, no raises, more concern for the company and no concern for the employees. I would highly not recommend anyone to work for Sears Holding."
bad,very disorganized at all times.  did not have merchandise to sell.  too many key items were out of stock.  delivery teams were a joke.  could not find upper management to  make a decision.  had way too many issues with product availability.
bad,"very underpaid, depending on what department you worked in you made $10 an hour or less. no room for growth, poor management, schedule is random every week, rude coworkers or coworkers that dont work, and pay rates are set so you cant get a raise unless you move up to management. would not recommend for people looking to move up in a job or be paid enough to live."
bad,"Regular work place "
bad,"I had worked at the Sears in the Burlington Center which closed recently. While I had worked there and been hired I was under a manager who was dedicated and also could work any position in the store. Because he was so capable they relocated him to another store and a better position (good for him!) Unfortunatly we then got a store manager who knew nothing about the position and also was unwilling to learn. He would refuse to learn how to be anything in the store and then become angry when things did not move smoothly or go his way. He forced out good employees and management with his poor attitude. Also, he removed associates from positions because the store was going downhill which then removed any thought of job security we had. I could see this happening and applied quickly for another job as I could not at the time have my job at risk or have a lapse in pay. I was hired and put in my two weeks."
bad,Please avoid the job offer from them. Leaders seemed to listen but they just did that no actions or consolidation after that. They dont work our hard work even I was the best 3 Sales Consultant in the company.
bad,"no room to grow/advance. poor management. Not enough hours to go around for everyone. A lot of favoritism from supervisors to certain employees. Workplace culture was off, had to look out for self."
bad,"My experience was working in Sears was overshadowed by my optimism of the company. Management would never offer help, advice, or promotions. Working heavy lifting and huge work orders in only 6 hour shifts, in a 20 hour week was unacceptable. Everyone is competitive and out to find something malicious on one another. There is definitely a hidden gem I did not find during my year there."
bad,"work a lot with pay, no raise."
bad,"It's a retail sales job. It's exactly what you think it is. If you've ever had a commissioned retail sales job, they're all basically the same. It was fine."
bad,"I worked in the jewelry department, opening I would perform daily inventory on certain product and place them in the showcases. Open cash registers make sure every case is locked and cleaned. Attend to customer needs and recommend credit cards, care plans, or any other product that the customers might be interested."
bad,Sears would be A great place to work if commission was more and also had a base pay no advancement very flexible with hours work every holiday with no holiday pay
bad,"The employees made it great, the managers did not. I wouldn't go back but it was a good place to get a little bit of info from to move to the next position"
bad,"My time at Sears taught me that I excel with customer service issues. "
bad,"Work was all about numbers"
bad,"I’ve worked here for about 3 years now and when I first started things were good and it was a cool place to work. Met different types of people from different backgrounds. Which was definitely nice, management at the time was decent as well. Although now management is horrible, most of them are not even on the same page. One person tells you one thing and another tells you something completely. So you have no idea who to listen to. I know not all of management here is horrible but there are a few. Most of the people that are hired and trained usually quit within the first few days or a couple of weeks in. Which leaves those of use that work there short staffed. The pay isn’t a lot at all for what other companies are paying their employees for the same amount of work. I used to love working here but it all went downhill so fast. It literally is so stressful and the pay is definitely doesn’t make things better. I feel like if you’re not a favorite of someone from management you will not move up. Which is not fair to those who do have the experience and tenure. This would be a good place if you’re trying to get experience or like a first time job. All in all I do love what I do but the pay and poor management don’t make it any better. If it wasn’t for my coworkers and me needing a job I wouldn’t be here. I definitely do thank them for the experience that I got while working here and I learned a lot since I’ve been here. Definitely will come in handy in the future."
bad,"A typical day working at Sears was somewhat mellow and calm however, when the holiday seasons come around then it becomes crazy which is expected. I have gain customer service experience from this job and it had allowed me to move onto to another job. I have learned to advise individuals about clothing, operate the cash register and process cash, checks and credit-debit card payments."
bad,"low pay "
bad,The environment was a giant call center.  No one had assigned desks so I never felt like I belonged there.  There is a quota you must meet if you don't you could be fired.
bad,"The poor management and the drama makes a nightmare working in this place. Some managers behaved as high schoolers, gossiping and fighting about stupid stuff. Then when you have a problem in the store, they didn't back you up, treating you like that was your fault. There some good managers but they fired them blaming them from wrongdoing or lack of leadership."
bad,"I worked at this store for a while, I saw many ups and downs and right now, it's very, very down.  There aren't many associates or customers in the store on any given day, the store manager doesn't have a clue as to what he's doing and it's just a negative atmosphere all around.  "
bad,Schedule provided unreliable hours with unorganized managers. Store just needs to be closed down because of lack of customers and supplies for cashiers.
bad,"Cash register work mostly, Also putting away inventory. Putting up sale tags. "
bad,"Some of the managers are great others are not. You might be lucky if you end up with a good manager.  There is no union no one to represent you if you are unfairly terminated, you are on your own.There policies are too rigid and Human Resource sucks!!"
bad,The job wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it is very stressful when customers come in and your trying to take care of them then your boss calls you down to the office for no reason and you cant even get anything done.
bad,"high turnover, "
bad,The culture does not make employees feel confortable. The most important thing for the company it's to make their number goes up no matter the cost. They basically prepared a non healthy work area and they constantly manipulate employees with low hours if the crew don't make the daily goal.
bad,"Es desgastaste los tipos de horarios que se manejan, y es increíble ver que personas con nulos conocimientos pero buenos amigos en los altos mandos son promovidos."
bad,Sears as a department store enterprise is sharply declining.  Both corporate and store management are living in the past despite cratering sales revenues and profitability.  Stay away!
bad,"work pace is extremely slow. There would be days on end where I would do nothing but sit down and watch Netflix all day. On our slowest day, we did $120 in sales the whole day."
bad,"Great if you need a job quick, but no so much for a career. If your not in good with management you may or may not be able to advance. It has a very  high school clique environment."
bad,This job was the biggest mistake I ever made while being a student in school. The management was very inconsiderate to that and took very little notice of my personal concerns with fellow employees.
bad,"Entry level jobs with at or below entry level pay,  They particapate in some of the same practices that other retail stores use.  It's not a bad place to work but neither is it good either."
bad,"worst place ever, coworkers were rude and shady, Manager stopped giving me hours out the blue and only gave me 1 day out the week but gave other people 30 plus."
bad,I was top sales person in my district and after the 3rd year of not getting a raise I realized they would rather have new employees then keeping trained ones.
bad,My manager was never helpful and when I needed her for something it would always take her forever to come and help the store would be completely empty and I would be across the store with a line of people and no help. No one ever paid attention the was theft and drugs found on the floor.
bad,"Over worked they keep adding on work load, management doesn't care about over worked employees.  the benefits are poor, not much room to grow, poor job security."
bad,This was an ok place to work as a temporary basis. The staff was mostly friendly and the customers for the most part were kind and cooperative. The pay was minimum and not enough
bad,"Not a place I would recommend to people to start their careers at, mostly because the technology there is from near 20 years ago. They fail to give us the tech to succeed in our jobs, and it makes us have to work harder, which in turn wastes more time. Not A Recommended Job."
bad,This company had a manger who could not even process his own refunds. Employees stole each others sales with no repercussions. And it was hard to schedule time off because the turn around of employees was so high.
bad,Nice part time job for extra money or a first job. Great discounts. Busy Saturdays! Flexible schedule. Awesome co-workers! Great holiday sales and promotions.
bad,"I came in as a seasonal team member, and they kept me for the regular year. However, during the regular year the way hours were given out changed, and my hours were cut based on things that were not talked about when I was hired on."
bad,It was an OK place to work. You are expected to do a lot more than you are trained to do. I was forced into a management position with very limited training.
bad,THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AT SEARS IS VERY OLD AND ALWAYS HAS PROBLEMS MAKING YOUR JOB SO MUCH HARDER AND LOST OF SALES.  Managemnet has no say in telling corporate of what changes should be made to improve sales and the work environment.
bad,when i first started with sears they were a fairly decent company. then they swapped a bunch of managers with very unqualified and unprofessional individuals. took are discount card and did shady nontransparent online time cards. cut are commission and forced us to drop quality customer service to sell there credit card to EVERYONE.
bad,"Other then the coworkers (individuals, who are worthy of mentioning), company has major issues which will hardly ever be addressed properly."
bad,"Did this job while getting my GED and trying to have money for Christmas. Would hardly get any hours, store stayed hot and pay was low. I only got on average about 10 hours a week."
bad,"So at first they through you onto a computer for training, which seems to be from the 80s. then they turn around and throw you on the floor no hands on training and overview. They get mad and threatening to let you go. they ask you to do work that you had no receive any training on and if you dare to ask for help or show you what you are SUPPOSE to do they get mad... As for hours it either you get a lot and they call you in within 30mins of you getting off or you get none at all. most people they employee are very nice as long as you have no life and you are ready to throw yourself into them. most employee are talking on phones and eating during work hours. They don't work well with anyone getting any days off or being sick so don't even ask. You will be let go of your job without notice or even a call. personal you are better off joining the military then working for them,"
bad,"A typical work day consisted of the shift you are assigned if it's in the morning you have to open and count the registers, make sure your area is clean in order for customers to feel welcomed. If it is the night shift you would have to clean the register area and put go backs away, and at closing, you have to count your register and leave a certain amount of money in the register depending on the season. I learned so much working at Sears for example how to provide excellent customer service regardless of the environment you are placed in."
bad,"very bad management"
bad,The management don't care if u make your 40 hours they make there's also don't care if ur struggling to make bills u will only work  what they say. I'd never left my other job if I knew the garbage hours I get cost more in benefits than u make. Oh and if u are one of the people that call out all the time u will get 48 hours a week not the people that have perfect attendance
bad,Love Sears and being in sales but they kept cutting jobs and positions leaving overwhelming depend on small crew of employees and feelings of anxiety over job security
bad,"In 2 years working there I accumulated 3 vacations days, and when you asked to get the days off they denied it. You start accumulate after 1 year working and is base on your hours worked."
bad,a typical work day at sears is pretty cool and laid back. but when there is an issue none of the managers except for one knows how to solve problems. Managers barely know how to do there jobs. I asked one manager to do a help ticket because only managers can do those. (something i have never done) and I had to help her do the help Ticket. so managers suck there except for one of them. I have been at sears for two years and i have not gotten an opportunity to make more money.
bad,I had to become a receiving clerk at a local Sears store because of a injury to my back.  The management at the location was horrible.  I had to continually remind them that I could not do certain thing that they asked.  Most of the staff at the location were very friendly and cooperative.  I really enjoyed working in the stores Christmas shop and even received a compliment from the district manager.
bad,"Working at sears for over a year now, alot of manajorial issues, and alot of issues with employees doing something their not supposed to do due to policy, and yet get away with it."
bad,"Management was often undermining and condescending. Never any advancements, raises or promotions. Environment was stressful and upper management were never positive towards their employees."
bad,"hundreds of fires and competing priorities that needed to be handled daily, few resources, hours cut and salaried managers working 70 hours per week to keep the doors open."
bad,The management at Sears needs to learn how to treat others. I do enjoy my position but am told to do other things as well. I do not mind but I now haven't time for my regular duties.
bad,"A great Company that could have been saved. It's too late for the company as time kept changing and they stood still. A place that does not promote  ""sense of ownership"" and nobody seems to have the authority to make a decision. Every question or decision is referred to the level above, which is then referred again above them, and so forth until it's lost in translation."
bad,"Sears will be the worst job I have ever had. By law, you're supposed to have a break after 2 hours and a lunch after 4 hours but not at Sears. You take your breaks on their schedule and sometimes I had to take my lunch near the end of my shift but they wrote it as if I took it on time. They don't take blame for their actions instead they blame it on the new guys at work. The management is a complete mess because they don't respect your availability. They schedule you when it's more convenient for them because at the end of the day it is a business that does not care for their employees. I recommend people to list Sears as their last resort when applying for a job."
bad,I was hired as a cashier and within three months I went from cashier to cash office associate to full time backroom associate. Which I thought was great however the pay is awful for all my title entails. They say that I am the gatekeeper and if that's so why do I just get 25 cents more than minimum wage. I love what I do and my coworkers and even upper management; however the pay sucks. That's why I am in search of better opportunity with benefits.
bad,"Wouldn't  give me enough hours to survive.. when I got another job they were unwilling to work around my  other schedule out of spite, wouldn't recommend it at all"
bad,"I really enjoyed my time at Sears. I worked with a great group of people there who were like a second family to me. I learned a lot of communication skills, taking care of customers, handling issues, merchandising, and took a real perspective on running a business."
bad,company didnt alow enough time to complete the jobs  also they dont care about the customer .  always a lot of pressure on the techs to sell products or extended warentys and even threatened you about being fired if you didnt make their weekly sales of 250.00 when i was there.  also took calls away from you if you had a disagreement with the so called tech manager!!!! which meant you didnt make you 40 hours a week  .  they showed you who was in charge !!!!
bad,"A typical day at working for Sears was standing behind the wrap, waiting for customers, or straightening out the aisles."
bad,"The job could be overwhelming at times, because of the fitting room, when I use to be a MCA Merchandiser Customer Assistance. I didn't have enough hours as I never got to be a full time."
bad,"Overall experience with this company was not too great. Management was very unorganized, shifts would get messed up due to poor scheduling. I would have to work two sections at a time some shifts."
bad,"This is a good entry level place to gain retail experience, but the compensation and advancement strategies are backwards. They promote the individuals who steal sales and are the laziest, while the people who work the hardest get left at the bottom. I got passed for promotions 5 times for individuals who were less qualified, and put in less effort than myself. You are graded on metrics, but goals are ridiculous compared to the traffic that comes in. In sales, if a customer makes an exchange on your off day, you lost the commission while the exchange associate gained it. You were told to do store to home transactions, and that it would still count in your bonus compensation, but the bonus was denied because of too many due to online only specials that you could not match in the store. Put up with it for 4 1/2 years."
bad,"I worked at Sear for 4 months as backroom associate. They don't train new staff, they just throw you to the wolves and say figure it out yourself. Horrible store management. Management mostly stand around gossiping about co workers. Worst experience"
bad,Sad place to work for. Sears is out for self and will turn they back on you when you need them. No matter how you break your back for them . Just my opinion.
bad,"A typical day at work started with a team meeting discussing how poorly everyone did the day before (regardless of how well people did). Where we go over what things we need to push on customers and what sales %s to keep up (about 8 things, which you got yelled at by 3-4 managers a day)."
bad,"Store MGT is constantly being pushed unmercifully to work 7 days a week."
bad,The cashiers work very hard at making sure our members find what they need and providing a quick and courteous check-out. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with unprofessional management--the best part is checking out members happy with your service.
bad,At first I was going to quit it was a lot of work for 7.49 an hour and only worked 10 hours a week. But I got a better opportunity to become a visual and it was great until the position got terminated
bad,no job security  everyone was out to get each other  no raises even with two years in  wrong people in wrong positions
bad,"Was there for all of 2 weeks and I received a total of 1 days actually training, 2 days of dealing with a manager who was also not being trained. Then was late 1 time and had been 10-15 min early every time before that, and was then told if I was late again I would be terminated. How do theny expect people to do a job you ask them to do if you don't train them or give them the tools to do the job you ask. Poor management and training, you can't just throw people out to the sharks and expect them to swim."
bad,Great systems and information available but sometimes the lack of change can be dangerous and you really have to dig deeper to find what you need.
bad,"Unprofessional, unfavorable plave to work, with no advancement or benefits for any kind of position. Ungrateful management that work you until you have nothing left with no time to leave for personal life and family."
bad,"Sears has earned its recent reputation as a bad place to work and for good reason.  Opportunities to advance are few and far between. Also, in the 2.5 years I worked there, we were never given a raise.  Their justification for this is that there are ways to increase your income by either more sales, web-to-store sales, etc...  Only problem is that certain jobs have limited customer interaction, and you are under a timer to get things done quickly.  That makes it really hard to do those things to increase your take home pay. We also went through store management quickly, mainly because the district management above them worked them hard and they burned out."
bad,Clock in and do your job and clock out. It's a job. There's nothing more to say. Things could be so much better but you can't complain because its a job and you could be unemployed. So I guess you must be thankful.
bad,The individuals who managed my local Sears have since been fired. P.S do not plan on getting maternal leave. You will be told to reapply and that you probably have no job to come back too. And they pressure their employees into getting people to ally/ join their programs and if they do not reach a quota then they have management threaten your job.
bad,Amplie capacidades de venta y desarrolle nuevas estrategías de persuasión a clientes.
bad,this was one of the most different places to work for it had its good . days as well as the bad. Managers were very hard to work for treated you wrong. I was compensated like you needed to have recieved in pay. I was working in the shipping and recieving area.
bad,"Management focuses on the customers and little on the employees. Often I'd do the work of a manager because my manager would be walking around not doing his job. Also focuses on Credit Card applications which everyone hates, even the associates and the managers make me feel bad for not getting enough. Sent me home for wearing my Seahawks jersey when coworkers and other managers were wearing the same every game day for the past few months instead of giving warnings."
bad,Extremely dead end job.  No opportunity for advancement very little pay for what you have to put up with.  I would not recommend this for a career but if your a college student it's perfect
bad,"The company about every 5 weeks were changing direction for the last 4 years I was there.  I had my task to do which I performed at a high level always being compliant with EPA and Company audits. "
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of helping customers, and displaying shoes and other merchandise accordingly."
bad,"I loved the job but the management was a bit of a joke. i loved working with my co-workers but the manager was very rude to the customers. we sent in repairs to tech center like mowers,snowblowers,chainsaws,etc Sold parts to customers."
bad,doing my job and three other peoples job at the same time and being walked on by some of the other co-workers because im a female
bad,"this is the most unorganized company I have worked for."
bad,"You begin with making the appropriate shift changes, some go to lunch or home for the day depending on the printed schedule. Early on there will be the opportunities to learn about credit applications,the reward program as well as how you will be monitored for in-store promotion. Management is very slow or sometimes even unresponsive to your requests, even those that pertain to your typical day's work. They often want you to work truly harder than what your job description states and not in a good way. They cut corners anyway possible to save money and get the most work for minimum wage as possible. Very often co-workers will get together and strike up a conversation, those who are ""veterans"" of the job usually gain the most amount of trust and leverage on management. There is a lot of gossip that goes around and you must be smart on how you interact with each individual employee as some are actually family who will ""gang up"" on you over small misunderstandings. The hardest part of the job is when dealing with returns as management will make customers go through hoops for a simple return. The most enjoyable part of the job by far is any sort of break you can get."
bad,"When I first started I used to enjoy working here till I started to see the flaws of the company. You're supposed talk(more like harass) people to sign up for the rewards program and sears credits. When you don't get them or not enough to the management's standards you get harassed by the managers there to the ends of the earth. As an apparel associate I had to do basically everyone's job. Cleaning the store floor, putting back all the clothing customers try on in the fitting room back to the sales floor, being on the cash register and helping customers.  Cleaning the floor and putting clothing back doesn't sound so bad unless your the only one that night doing it all especially on a busy day. Then getting yelled at by management as to why you can't do the job of ten people, which is what they expect you to do. Management never listens to any of the complaints of any of their associates and just expect you to deal with. One of the most stressful places to work at especially if your working in one of the clothing departments.  Most new hires leave a couple of months after being here."
bad,One of the worst companies to work for.  They don't treat their employees with any amount of respect.  They demand so much from their associates and are not the least bit understanding.
bad,"Duties included, documenting, filing, handling finances, scheduling appointments and cleaning up the facility. I was able to learn the requirements and laws pertaining to Drivers Ed. Being a secretary for a driving school was nice because I got to learn new things."
bad,My typical day was balancing the cash office.  The pay and hours were very low.  I worked for minimum wage and only 15 hours a week.  No room for advancement
bad,Employees are constantly being drilled by management over things that they cannot control. The company has too high of standards for the economic times we are currently facing.
bad,"Pros: some of the co workers were nice"
bad,"This place is terrible, management is judgmental, they overwork you without giving you breaks or lunch breaks. The pay rate is super low and they make you do too many things that no management is willing to help you or other employees. They need for staff members and hire friendly manager."
bad,This is a job for high school students looking for some cash. I did not like constantly being pressured to sell credit cards and make customers unhappy when i had to ask them a thousand questions.
bad,"Poorly managed. Its a broken business, with a broken system. Its the model of work hard and get absolutely no where. "
bad,"The tasks I am required to perform and coordinating/assisting several coworkers is the more enjoyable part of work. The managers tendency to use scheduling (overscheduling) as a form of punishment and unable to rationally justify it was a major factor in the overall low morale in this shop.His overbearing style and inability to effectively communicate placed a heavy burden on me and other employees. Rather than have even a minimum amount of regard for his employees, I have personally seen and heard him belittle one employee in particular He exhibits little or no concern for our safety. His motivation was entirely the bottom line,  and trying to out do the other auto center on the other side of town."
bad,they don't want to work around my schedule. when I ask for a certain amount of hours to work they don't want to arrange the schedule. so its very unfair scheduling. the management is not good. they take a lot of time to come to the associates call when we need them even If a customer is waiting. some of the co-workers are pretty cool. the hardest part of work is going. the job is not enjoyable at all. the managers don't want you talking to anyone in another area of the store so its boring when you have absolutely nothing else to do. the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out.
bad,My co-workers that work on the floor with me are the best.We love to have fun and laugh while working.
bad,The management and the entire work force lack motivation. The company does not inform its employee of the status or state of the company's standing.
bad,"I learn various sales tactics in this job field, but the constant metrixs and the drop in sales, does effect us Sales Consultants. We do not make as much as we use too, and the management its completely off, and take Sears as a joke."
bad,very stressful job for minimum wage. to much trying to get people to apply for credits cards and not enough customer service. was there 3 years and never received a raise.
bad,There is always a lot of work and little time to do it. You will definitely always be busy during a day at Sears!
bad,Good co-workers but work related tasks comes with headaches.
bad,"Do not bother applying to this job, you will only get on average 25 hours a week, you will be required to actually work on national holidays like ThanksGiving Day, 4th of July, etc, and the paycheck, well its not worth all of this aggravation!! This a HARD LABOR INTENSIVE JOB, if you like physical jobs like these, you would be better off just working as an Electrician's Helper, an Drywall Hanger or Plumber's Helper, at these jobs will pay you more than Sears pays their employees! And by the way, Sears Outlet Store ARE NOT OWNED BY SEARS, they are franchised stores that just carry USED furniture, dryers/washers and kitchen appliances, so you are not going to get any GOOD COMAPNY BENEFITS!!"
bad,"Executive branch has its work cut out for them, the organization is being ran like a start up company, the only issue is that its a few billion in revenue and companies which that income need structure and vision to which Sears currently lacks. Every business unit runs on a retail platform no matter what the operations of the business unit  requires."
bad,management is very unorganized and gives the blame to the associates for their mistakes.
bad,Working barely any hours because they pick and choose who gets hours. I don't have kids so I was not considered in need of hours.
bad,Loved working for Sears. The hours were great as well the discount on merchandise.
bad,The people i work with are great but the hours and pay wage isn't that great.
bad,Not organized and no room for growth. Co-workers backstab one another a lot of favoritism. Uncomfortable work environment.
bad,"This is more so an application to the kmart corporation. Co-workers are great but the pay is minimal, managers will not care about you, there are no benefits, the sanitary standards are low, and preferential treatment is given to male workers. Managers tell off employees in front of their co-workers. You are better off elsewhere any day of the week."
bad,"Little business so you'd be standing around waiting for the first customer to appear. Systems are outdated and hard to work with because they were frequently crashing or falling apart. I learned to keep my head down and focus on my goals. co-workers were easy to work with. Management didn't support you if an upset customer voiced their frustration to them for a policy the management set and demanded employees follow. Management also reprimanded a few employees on the sales floor in front of customers, which in opinion was unprofessional. Your rarely got your breaks except for the one legal one that was your lunch. No raises, even if you've worked their for 3 years. The hardest part of the job was working with management. Most enjoyable part was working with co-workers and seeing regular customers in the store from your community."
bad,"This job was ok at best. The overall environment is disappointing. The employees are pretty much treated poorly, there is very little in the way of benefits, and no real incentive to strive for anything because advancement is based on cronyism. If management would work with regional management to offer merit raises, base promotions on a multiple reviewer checklist, and look at enhancing benefits, and increase base salaries everything would change for the better."
bad,High pressure work environment for minimum wage. A lot of pressure to sign people up for the Sears credit card. Threatening management tactics to get you to perform.
bad,"There is a horrible work environment. Employees are always fighting amongst themselves over sales. "
bad,Don't waste your time. This is the textbook definition of a 'dead end' job.
bad,"Did not like being a stock person"
bad,"It was interesting work, but offered no real financial stability because the 800+ miles per week of commuting on 100% commission."
bad,"It is a great job... If you like to be downgraded on a daily bases. "
bad,"When I came in for my first day I was not ID'ed to confirm anything. I was informed by an employee right off the bat to have a lock because theft was a problem. Then we toured the facilities; the break room was dirty and did not have enough chairs to seat people , The bathroom was even worse no one was cleaning the bathrooms regularly or even at all. They obviously did not care about the employees that much to not have these problems fixed. Once I got to the floor to see the rest of the workers...I knew...lets just say they don't drug test here. I worked for a full day. In that day all I did was hang up clothes on proper hangers, I couldn't continue on, I guess this sort of work would be for people that are desperate because I was not."
bad,"I would recommend this job to someone who has never had a job and needs experience. They are very short staffed and I often found myself working in other departments that I knew nothing about because of under staffing. I quit because December was ""black out dates"" and they wouldn't let me take 6 days off a week BEFORE Christmas to go see my family 600 miles away. There is no advancement, only within sales departments. They give no raises."
bad,"Good competitive environment. Learned crucial management skills. Best part of the job is the competitive selling to make more money, also is the hardest."
bad,"I have really good customer service, and work really hard cleaning carpets, hardwood floor, and ceramic floors."
bad,"Report to work at 5:30a.m. and print reports for how many expected trucks/cartons to be received. From these reports, I would determine the optimal number of associate required to complete the volume. Once staffing level and job duties were delegated, I would then meet with my operations manager to talk about the daily agenda so he could address the morning meeting (GM and other dept. Opps) of our department’s daily plan. Then I would have a brief conference call with all other department managers to talk about staffing issues that could be resolved at that time or throughout the shift. This meeting usually last till the start of the shift were we laid out our plans and job responsibilities to the associates in the start-up meetings. "
bad,"They are unorganized, the pay is terrible, no customers. Its too many things to say."
bad,"Did my best ""Lets DO It"" learn everything about merchadising and sales"
bad,"As stated above, I don't really wish to comment. I felt very taken avantage of when working for this company. Promises were made and never kept. I would work open to close on more than one occasion. Turned into working every night of the week with maybe one day off every two or three weeks. Then when I left I was treated poorly by one of my managers because of it."
bad,"Learned that the customers are buying more on the innernet than going into the store."
bad,"Managent seems to be confused and lacking guidannce from above.  The job is interesting and educational, as are the customers/members.  I've learned more about lawnmowers, tractors, patio furniture, and fitness equipment than I thought I ever would. My coworkers are as good as you can get, bar none.  The hardest part of my job is trying to incorporate vacillating company policies into proper selling practices without sounding like a snake-oil salesman. With that said, I still enjoy helping the customers with their questions and helping them make the correct choices for what they want to purchase and having them come back to me for future purchases."
bad,Was a driver and warehouse and help guys in the field Had own truck and got to take it home. Job was ok.
bad,Management of the store that I work in is questionable in ethics and overall competence . They tend to dump their duties and responsibilities on everyone else. They are dishonest to there employees and make promises they have no intention of keeping . My boss is not knowledgeable about his job in any way and allows unethical employees to work for Sears . The best part of the job is dealing with the customers and the personal satisfaction from being the top sales person in the store.
bad,It was a place to start working. There wasn't alot of room for advancement and no benefits.
bad,"*Worked part time, they didn't allow p/t workers to leave for breaks, they actually didn't want you to even step outside of the store. "
bad,"the call center is very unorganized, they will change your schedule without any notice.the training you recieve in the classroom is the complete opposite of how they want you to perform on the sales floor "
bad,"I put my all into my job. I tried many times to work with my managers, but aside from the generic comments they replied with, they didnt get it. "
bad,Placing stock on shelves. Placing overstock in bins. How to use the Sears network inventory device. Management left lot to be desired. Co-workers satisfactory. 
bad,"Maintained neat work space. Used and maintained register. Answered phones and customer questions. Assisted customers in shopping choices locations of items etc. Knew a lot of customers and recognized by them as well. I enjoyed helping the customers; they were usually friendly. I took inventory. I rotated into every department. Maintained displays and floor."
bad,as a company it needs to come into the 21st century as far as taking care of employees.
bad,A typical day would be very busy.Management was out of order.Some of my co workers was ok but i pretty much stayed to myself.The hardest part was coming to the jo it self.And the enjoyable part about coming was seeing some of my co workers.
bad,Working for Sears was not the best experience I have had. It is very hard to move up in the company and those capable of being managers are often overlooked.
bad,"One has to join the click to get your requested days off, and to not have to close most nights. Had to talk customers into getting charge cards even when they did not want them. I used to be a sears customer until I worked there. They encouraged to trick customers into charge cards and the shop your way, and I just could not do that, so this was not the job for me."
bad,"On a typical day at Sears, it starts out with the morning meeting, all the cashiers attend, where they tell us about the store stats. The registers are then counted and the day really begins. It's pretty much dead in the store throughout the whole day and the coworkers that you have are typically young and immature. Management is only concerned with employees who get credit for the store, everyone else might as well be considered contagious with an infectious disease. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with some of the other employees, because they're rude and self absorbed. In fact, some of the employees were cheating at their job, and management had been notified many times and no action was followed through. As long as those employees got the company's stats up, the company didn't seem to care how those employees conducted their work. No one in this company has any integrity and is very unprofessional."
bad,"Sears is a well known and respected company that is going under. There is nothing wrong with the job itself, however management and coworkers don't care about anyone but themselves, I'm a customer focused individual and my most current manager shortened my hours and pretty much cut me from the position. I was there for two years and the best sales and positive customer feed back of the whole department. When the new manager took over she didn't want anyone being better than her, even though she still knew nothing about her position, her associates positions, and the department she was working in. I left after two years because the harrassment and unfairness was taken too far."
bad,"Starts out okay, Co-workers are okay to work with, Didn't learn really much from what I already knew, Management was okay, Hardest part was keeping hours. Only enjoyable part was co workers."
bad,"aprendi muchas cosas al estar ahi, me hizo comprender muchas cosas, pero hace falta organizacion y supervision por parte de las personas de rango mas alto como gerencia, recursos humanos,auditoria, lo mas dificil de este trabajo fue el ambiente laboral, era muy pesado con muy poco compañerismo, la falta de comunicacion, falta de respeto. es por eso que dure muy poco tiempo."
bad,I have been employee here for two years and I will say I don't know how this company stays open and relevent in the world. They should close the doors and become a distant memory
bad,low pay and hard work. management was very political. advancement opportunities were based on who knew know and now how well you worked
bad,"worked there for 4 years, had a problem working around my other personal activities"
bad,It's pretty much a steady work place at times there where a lot of down time the company was going through a managment Change and they are going out of business and becoming a new company co-workers are ok not pushed enough to succeed management like I said should be more hands on no hard part of the job the biggest was unloading the appliances most enjoyable part customers and unloading and setting up appliances
bad,The industry I currently work in is retail in a department store. An average day for me starts off with setting up proper promotional signing on key items. This is followed by merchandising the sales floor before the start of the day with the general public. Once the customers begin to arrive my duties gravitate to assisting the customer’s needs and continuing to merchandise the floor. My duties also include answering phone calls and processing merchandise orders using a web based ordering system. In interacting with the public on an everyday basis my customer service skills have increase. Working in a department store setting you learn to work in teams since the store is divided by product. In retail team work is key. Often times you have to pick up where a fellow team mate has left off to insure that projects and assignments are done to the fullest. You learn to rely on your team mates and management for support. Because of the strains on the economy at this present time there are a lot of cut backs but more responsibilities. Therefore your work can never be sufficient if you don’t have the allotted time or recourses to complete the assignment. Because of this the stress factor is raised considerably. However when I can help an elderly person find what they need or help a parent put a smile on there child’s face it brings a little joy to the day.
bad,I enjoyed going to work on most days. I only had a working relationship with my immediate supervisor so everything was strictly business. The thing I enjoyed most about my job is I met a lot of nice people.
bad,fun attitude between co-workers but very boring and stressful over all
bad,"early mornings, not enough wages for the job i did. alot of heavy lifting and physical labour"
bad,"A typical day working here consisted of constant irate callers calling in to complain about the terrible service they received or lack there of. The appliances that were delivered to customer's homes were either damaged or did not work or the contractor never showed up to the appointment. They do not give raises here but they expect you to learn how to handle three different departments with only two days of training. Let's not even go there with dress code. I've seen anything from Nike slippers, spandex with panty lines showing, sweatpants, short shorts with tattoo's up the thighs to sagging skinny jeans with the boxers showing. I felt like I was working at the second hand store. But what do you expect when you don't want to pay anybody."
bad,"Managers did not help you at all. You had to do the job of the sales associate and the manager while getting paid nothing. Commission rates constantly were dropping, and business is getting worse and worse. I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did at this dead end job."
bad,"I was terminated from this job after only a short time because my daughter was in the hospital with pneumonia for a week. I checked in with my supervisor every day, alerting her when I would be back and I even brought an excuse back with me, but they fired me anyway."
bad,Depending on which department you work in it can be a fun place to work. They have a tendency to lay you off if you refuse to sign paper work that you don't agree with or goes against your morals and values.
bad,Not the type of place you want to work if you do not have patients. I personally made the best of the situation but not the place to work by choice
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful but very eventful. Typically I find that the managers can not make direct decisions so my work tends to double or triple at least 3 - 4 times a week. Overall moral is bad due to managers speaking to staff in devaluing tones on the floor, and sometimes its in front of customers ( I have seen it too many times). The customers and co workers are great which is what gets me through the day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management and trying to keep the team motivated and happy to be there. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I actually get to perform my visual merchandising duties because design is a true passion of mine."
bad,"the company did not offer benefits, the break room you had to pay for the sugar, creamer etc, they would consider that stealing ."
bad,"Working at Sears would have been fine, your basic retail associate experience, if not for how much and how emphatically they pushed credit applications. Getting a customer to apply for a credit app was the *only* thing that mattered to anyone, and the goal number of apps per person were highly unrealistic and we were made to feel personally bad for not meeting them. Extra tasks were assigned and then forgotten about constantly, training for anything is a joke, and your hours would be cut the second you failed to meet their credit goals. They were perpetually short-staffed, to the point where it was not at all unusual to have only a single associate in any department at a given time."
bad,I worked for them for 6 years. Never had a promotion officially. Never had a raise. Was working full time hours but part time pay. Management did not care about employees only themselves and the company
bad,"Siempre falta personal, el trato al trabajador es pésimo, no hay pago de horas extras."
bad,"Sears is getting ready to go out of business.  They are always hiring.  There isn't enough job security, due to the fact that they are probably going to close soon."
bad,"Sears is poorly run by managers on duty,  after working there now I know why Sears is closing many stores and is struggling financially poorly run ,never enough employees on duty"
bad,"The base daily routine is meetings before open, working registers until a secondary or tertiary employee arrives, then floor maintenance, stocking, and finally, more floor maintenance.  The harder you work, the harsher you are criticized. The management has a bad tendency of lecturing only the most responsible employees because they know that the responsible one is the only one that will listen to them. Meanwhile, the others will be sitting around all day on their phones. The best part is when you get lunch break with other reliable employees, where you have to watch what you say because any form of gossip spreads really fast, and the managers are always lurking around the break room."
bad,"At Sears all they really care about is you showing up for work and getting everything done. They didn’t really consider the fact that there may be other responsibilities that need to come first. Didn’t want to work with my schedule, they always wanted it their way."
bad,"The company was terrible to work for. The people were okay, the pay was horrible and you never got a raise, in all the time I worked there. Poor communication."
bad,"I was hired knowing there would be some OT however I was not advised that the job came first and you could work 12 hours a day waiving breaks and lunches. It is good for someone who does like mechanical work, travel through your area and good pay. The PTO policy is confusing and essentially keeps you from taking PTO for over a year."
bad,"Dont do it. Management doesnt understand the workings of some of there purchasing options. Only one manager knew her job, she may still be there to  hold that store down tightly."
bad,"Some coworkers are great to work with, others are lazy and gossip alot. Managers hang out in a group only around when you call for help 2-3 times. They hire to many young childish people, there's no advancement in moving up, and the pay is only minimum wage with never a raise. They let some employees get by with anything when in reality they need to be fired. If you dont get credit for them or keep your syw up you get less hours in which is not right, if you give great customer experience you should be able to get more hours. Like  in other reviews it states managers do sit in their offices more than what their on the floor to do their work. They have their favorites."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the customers, cashiering, stocking, just about everything about the job.  I just didnt appreciate one aspect of the job and that is what cost them almost every one of their wonderful employees which in turn cost them their customers."
bad,"Les employés étaient majoritairement livrés à eux-mêmes puisque les membres de la direction changeaient constamment et ne s'impliquaient pas autant qu'ils l'auraient dû sur plusieurs aspects. Les formations n'étaient pas donnés à tous les employés, ce qui causait des problèmes puisqu'il y avait confusion sur plusieurs tâches ou objectifs. "
bad,"The company doesn't live up to its promises. You are promised commission, which you will be lucky if you ever see it. The hours are always different, which makes planning difficult. The pay period is every 2 weeks."
bad,"A typical day in Sears shoe department would consist of making sure the floor is clean, current inventory is on display and helping customers with purchases.  "
bad,I had worked for Sears Holdings for about six months. There is no stability in this company and no room for advancement. The company has their priorities set in the wrong places and management is not on top of anything. I literally worked hard for about three weeks and after that it just went downhill. I was left alone with no direction or guidance and no response from management when I would ask them for projects. Overall an unstable company with no room for growth.
bad,Sears was a great company to work for with future advancement opportunity however today I'm fearful I may not have a job soon due to the possibility of Sears filing bankruptcy.
bad,"not organized,they ended up shutting down didn't even give us a notice I had clients coming in to pick up pictures , it was horrible and sad management and co workers were awesome had a blast taking pictures"
bad,"I will state that my immediate team and management team were a group of great people. Enjoyed that part of the job."
bad,A typical work day was I'm asked to do a completely different task that was not consistent to my actual department. I've learned sears relies on the their credit cards and shop your way reward program more then customer service. Management was very poor and is not always on the floor or available to assist associates or was rude to customers. Workplace was very tense and stressful. Closing; they had one associate covering two departments. The most enjoyable part was when customers give sympathy and understanding to associates that they can see are doing there best to help them solve problems.
bad,Sears is very aggressive in sales. Every time a transaction is done a Sears credit card either needs to be used or applied for at the time of the purchase otherwise it will count against you and you can leave -93% at the end of the day. Also scheduling is very inconsistent and makes no sense some days I would be scheduled for a 3 hour shift another day an 8 hour. The schedule is also all over the place and makes it very difficult to work another job or go to school.
bad,I really don't want to say anything about Sears.
bad,It is ok if you have no responsibility or just a student with first job but you never really get hours unless you can bring in alot of credit applications and it just isn't great for a person trying to make a living
bad,working seasonally wasnt too bad but working during the year was very stressful. there was lots of pressure to get customers to sign up for credit cards and lots of people got let go for having low numbers. then they just hire someone else and hope theyll do better than the last.
bad,Poor leadership skills in upper management led to the demise of sears and finally closure.  Everyone was just waiting for the store to close and finally it did.
bad,lack of communication on most times one manager tells you one thing and the store manager another one.  lack of advancement in the 6 plus years I worked there got maybe one raise and it was 20 cents.
bad,"I work in ""support"" which means they essentially throw everyone's duties at you. Recently the job has become even more undesirable because on top of doing Merchandise pick-up, preparing local deliveries, UPS shipping and receiving, unloading freight, and pulling web deliveries, we now also have to hang the stock on the floor, price the stock, and place/pull signage for ads and sales."
bad,"They will constantly suggest giving you raises while they continually add to your work load, and then hope that you forget about it. My direct manager was alright, but that may be biased; because he was a friend of mine however any other manager at my location will be some of the worst, most condescending, and ignorant people that I've ever seen."
bad,"Sears is a store that people mostly go in and out of in the matter of minutes or they are there to look at appliances/tools. It was incredibly boring and stressful since, as a cashier, managers make you get 10 membership sign ups a shift. However, most customers already have a membership."
bad,"Sears was a good company to work in overall. the hours were not tiny but not tremendous. Alot of my problem was held by management, as there were signs of favoritism within the team. I was terminated after 2 call ins during my time there. I showed I was a valuable asset to the team with a 120% devotion to my work ethic to further myself and to the company. All in all i believe the company is great! I just had an unfortunate run."
bad,"I mean it. management never did the right paperwork, never was told what was even supposed to do in my position, and all the money you'll think you make is a lie."
bad,"Great First Job, for anyone with little things to pay for! The hours were always inconstant, and they never respect your schedule! They only care about them self and not the workers."
bad,I did noy want to write a review but this seems to be a must for tbis site on my phone. I at the moment feel insecure about my job and if I will have one in a few years here.
bad,"This company is a walking husk of its former self. There is no future, no advancement, and soon no company. Only work here part time and only if it does not matter that you may not have a job next week."
bad,"I worked at Sears for almost two years.  I made sure that I always completed my tasks and they rewarded me with more tasks that were unpleasant.  The building had black mold, the store manager was having inappropriate relations  with employees, and they were on the brink of closing, so they cut hours unexpectedly.  This place closed for the better."
bad,Most likely this company will be filing for bankruptcy. Very stressful atmosphere to work in. The only positives I took from my job there was learning new things and meeting a lot of new people.
bad,"Worst management team ever. Very disrespectful management. Extreme discrimination on all levels. Management not approachable to any employees. If you work there, document daily because you will be working with snakes and liars."
bad,I would not advise working for Sears if you are not competitive it takes time and hard work to sign people up for credit cards with today's economy that is ultimately the goal  to keep customers coming back signing customers up for Shop Your Way Rewards is not so difficult it does not require signing up for a master credit card Shop
bad,"work is fair and paid well "
bad,"Sears is a dying company, and working at Sears Auto was just proof of that. Long, dreadful hours every day with no vacation or sick pay because every single non-management position is part-time and therefore ineligible, terrible working conditions with far outdated computer systems and equipment for the technicians. It was just a temporary job, but if they want to be relevant and rebuild their business, they need to update and offer more to their employees rather than offering them below the average on everything."
bad,"Due to the nature of the position , facility problem solving the position was stressful. I learned how to manage time. The culture was disgruntled due to low wages and lack of increases."
bad,Job was not what it had been sold as when the position was offered. Pay was not correct and benefits took forever to get process. Rampant abuse of corporate credit cards by management on business lunches and other expenses. Left after reporting to corporate and nothing was done.
bad,"Review for Sears Holdings - Dying giant living on past legacy, 0 work life balance and no job advancement options, buttering and crony work culture required"
bad,"Shady and untrustworthy management, poor culture, absolutely zero accountability for any genuine concerns (meaning, several employees complaining about matters such as noise and disrespectful behavior on the call floor, legitimate concerns regarding mistreatment from the staff, lack of concern for customers, or absolutely no effort to rectify problems)."
bad,"At one time, Sears was a wonderful company to work for.  We had raises and profit sharing and were treated fairly.  Now, there is no leadership by management. No communication of ideas, no raises in years.  It has become toxic."
bad,"Managers didn't care what others did, they had preferences . The loss prevention manager was a piece of sh** !! Lowered hours for no reason whatsoever."
bad,"Worked here for more than 2 years, had been in multiple meetings and conversations with the general manager of the store, she could never figure out my name. Called me every other name that began with the same letter as mine, but never my actual name."
bad,"Long days and lack of support, handled terrific team of techs and sales reps but compensation did not match effort that I put in, Also had a lot of responsibility but not a lot of control"
bad,Not the place to build a long time career. Good for teens needing a part time job. Management wasn't the best and the job cared more about numbers instead of employees.
bad,"I worked for Sears over 10 years. At first it was very pleasant to work for the company but in the recent years things have changed with really no explanation. Pay raises were frozen for years, benefits packages have completely changed, and room for advancement was very limited. It's about ""who you know not what you know"". The hardest part of the job was not the actual work but the workplace culture was no longer enviable."
bad,"Sad that this used to be one of the best retailers in the US. Now it is dying a slow and painful death and treating the workers there terrible. As a manager they worked you about 15 to 20 hours extra a week and had you to pull shifts running a cash registers outside of your scheduled shifts, to keep from paying an associate. Do not recommend working here."
bad,Some associates will not help customers with bill paying or electronics sales hiding until they can sell a refrigerator.  Hours are also inconsistent.
bad,Lots of turnover with upper management the company is moving in a negative direction. Stores are closing all over and can't keep good managers. Low pay
bad,I traveled the state of AZ conducting new hire training for 8 stores. required a lot of road time. Turnover was quite high at their stores so there never seemed to be an opportunity to further training
bad,Sell this sell that. Learned that the GPS works well. Management has their favorites. Most of the technicians look out for each other. Hardest part of the job is telling the customer that something is not covered.
bad,You play credit hawk the entire job. Your worth depends on how many people apply for credit with you after you've harassed them enough. You could be the worst customer service associate but if you find some sneaky way of convincing customers to apply every shift you've one yourself hours
bad,"if u your desperate for a job, work here, nothing else much to say. its ok for someone who is trying to learn about cars. they will train when they have enough people to send you to training, incompetence managers"
bad,"I was there a week and management was gossiping about me. Management continues to be incompetent and doesnt have any respect for their employees. I have worked at a few stores, and even stores that are going through bankruptcies etc that Sears is, but I have never worked in such an unprofessional environment. If the store doesnt die on its own, everyone leaving because of these issues are sure to force the doors closed."
bad,Stressful and everything was timed. Advancement was extremely slow and shifts varied widely. Tools had to be bought out of your own pocket to work there.
bad,"Sears is living in the past and needs to be closed and let target and Walmart have there customers,  moving everything to online sales, pushing store to create online sales over regular sales."
bad,"There is no job security with this company, it doesn't matter if you have been there for 1 day or 10 years your job is on the line and could be cut at any time with the way Sears financial future looks.  Also to work for a Manager that gives you your review based on your piers performance and not your own is not a great company to work for.  There is no work life balance, schedules came out on Thursday's for the following week.  So you couldn't even plan anything with your family, and they could change it at a moments notice so you always had to check it to make your it wasn't changed.  The worst part is you bust your butt day in and day out and don't get the recognition that you deserve because the upper management would take credit for your hard work.  I always believed that you should give credit where credit is due, that is the only way to build up team but not here."
bad,"with recent change of company's culture, the managment lanched the flexi working hour to all staff.  "
bad,Slow work environment with little to no room for advancement. A job that is slowly dying out as the company closes more and more store locations across the US.
bad,Did not enjoy working at Sears Holdings.  The working environment was just as unstable in 2008 as it is in 2017.  No one seemed to be able to guide temps with questions.  I also felt very uneasy when more than two people would walk past my desk at the corporate office because the building would bounce harder the more people would pass by.
bad,"I am currently a cashier at Sears and have been working there for almost a year. I completely disapprove of the management and Lost Protection, they are constantly looking to fire people. The commission is not enough to have to deal with the customers and the managers especially on days where they require us to get 10."
bad,I have worked for Sears for 7 years in the footwear department/cashier.  When I first started several years back it was a good company to work for but after changing several managers and assistant managers the job has gone down.  Things are not being taken care of and the employees are not treated fair.
bad,"I worked at Sears for three years. For the most part I enjoyed my time working with different departments at making sure their print needs/distributions were met and on time.  It was challenging and I learned a lot."
bad,At this job I experienced the most discrimination in the my life.They would cut your hrs to give it to someone Hispanic. There was an employee who was hired after receive 33 hrs while I got 9 for the week.
bad,"No communication from store manager to all associates."
bad,The managers were very disrespectful and show favoritism. With the favoritism leads to other coworkers to have more work hours than anyone else. Lack of communication of what would go on.
bad,"At the location i worked at there was so much bullying and racism. Everyone even managers bullied this asian girl. They all bullied her because of her accent. I could understand her perfectly but due to racism and lack of maturity amongst the other workers, they bullied her. I DO NOT RECOMMEND SUPPORTING SUCH A DISGUSTING ESTABLISHMENT."
bad,Ability to work nights and weekends is almost necessary.  Holidays are stressful and overtime is typical.  Generally have the opportunity for advancement within store.
bad,"basically, this job was the equivalent of old calling on your feet for hours. it is very hard to get sales when yur jst walking up to them asking, and randomly askign them if they need work doen on their home. The idea alone sounds irrtiating."
bad,"Sears was the first job that I had ever held, and it was horrible. I was given very minimal training before being moved on to a cash register where I was then left alone on my first day. There were several dozen instances in which I needed managerial assistance with a transaction and it would take upwards of twenty or so minutes before the manager would arrive. In addition, I was also put into areas of the store and expected to be able to answer questions about the products in the area without any training or familiarization with them. In short, terrible training, expected to do more than I was trained for and not payed well enough for what I was being asked to do."
bad,"There was bad communication with the management from the beginning. I never was introduced to the store manager, or told when store hours were changing. When I was needed to call in sick, the number I was given to call was a disconnected number."
bad,"Conducted general building maintenance including HVAC, electrical, plumbing, communications and construction.  This position was very demanding with constant work being presented and schedules.  Priority considerations on projects and constant balancing of work loads were needed.  Pay was low for the times."
bad,"This company has a ridicules amount of turn over and doesn't seem to realize that its not the employees it is the management, their is no wonder they are closing so many stores."
bad,"I did not like my environment, and i will never work for them again. i liked most of my customers. The others would often come through and act like we were peasants. I even had a guy come through and spit on the floor. Managers treated most of their employees bad."
bad,The company just does not treat the employees like it used too. The company is not healthy enough to treat employees the way a company should. I would not take away the experience ive gained working at sears but I would not work there again.
bad,I really disliked this job. I like manual labor and the job itself was okay but the management was old and just apathetic. They would ignore us. Especially our Operations Manager.
bad,"Liked the people I worked with, management is scattered brain at best.  No real goals, all about add-on to sales, needless waste of time and money. No one can make a decision, no help when needed."
bad,"At Sears a day consisted of loading a pickup truck for delivery with a dolly, then printing maps out and driving to the install locations to get the deliveries off the truck and install them. Then we take their old appliances and do the same procedure for every delivery. I didnt really learn anything I didnt already know. The management wasnt very helpful and didnt do any training what so ever."
bad,"it was a horrible work experience id only wish it on my worse enemy. id give more info but it just spirals into alot of issues.the equipment (casheirs and the likes) was always breaking down or outdated, management was horrid and my department which was divided into two departments on oppisite sides of the store went through three supervisors who left due to stress,bs hours, and lack of good pay, and they got payed more then all of us. and more hours which was always random. the customers we attrached were self-entitled and didnt understand the concept of ""their is no item by that named sold here"" even going so far as to call the store manager and curse all the staff only to realize they were in fact at the wrong store. the rotating door on staff was spinning at inhuman speeds and im surprise i was able to leave sane. it also started at the low end at was only at 9.50 when i left bi weekly.......so yeah i hope you like the struggle if you want this job."
bad,"Some of the manager are not respectful with their employees.  The department I worked  for was  Landsend the Manager there was bipolar one day she was happy and another day she was talking down to you and had an attitude. Her personally changed within minutes.  She was a hard person to get along with. Another person who was  difficult to talk to was the General Manager of the store he was another difficult person also to deal with. I manage to stay for one year there until I found a new job.  The pay is minimal, they never have hours."
bad,"my overall experience at Sears wasn't the greatest. HR was extremely hard to get a hold of if ever there was a situation where I needed to speak with someone. "
bad,Company incentives and perks are a constant thing when productivity is met beyond standards. Constant driven meetings to ensure all members are as informed as possible to keep profits elevated. Very competitive atmosphere
bad,"A typical day at work starts off slow, only if I go in the morning, with a few customers here and there, if I'm lucky. I clean up after previous employees who closed the night before, but if not, I finish what I had done if I closed, and make sure everything is tidy. And if there isn't much to do, I almost always help out with my other associates such as, helping out with long lines at the registers, or tiding up the store. I've learned its best to work as a team, not alone, but on a task we always work alone and I feel nothing gets done, and it's only because the managers there don't believe in team work and how much better we can improve the store if we all worked together. The management is not the best, but they try really hard to be the best which isn't efficient, only because they pressure us so much to the point that the employees give up, and don't want to try anymore. The only thing they care about is credits. ""No customers? Cool, you still need to get credit."" I get why, but they never teach you the skills to be the best at getting credits, or be there to help out and guide us, which is the hardest part of the job. But the most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers, we get the work done, and communicate as a team should when we get the chance to work together."
bad,You are not respected and are treated like just another person. You're not valued or important. You are told to do one thing and expected to do ten other things at the same time. Not worth it.
bad,Sears is a fun work place because of the employees. Sears does not have any benefits.This company does not pay well. This company does not give out rises.
bad,Spend each day going over data that has been reviewed before.  No chance for advancement unless you play office polotics or know someone.  Stressful after every quarter of layoff since being in the red for the last 7 years.
bad,"I have never worked at a place where the employees were treated with such disrespect. Upper management didn't know how to manage the center and made decisions and changes to polices that made no sense and made the job more difficult to do and never consulted the people who actually did the job. "
bad,"Working for third party vendor inside sears, I received the benefit of a decent work/life balance. But, managers that work directly for Sears did not have such a luxury."
bad,"Totally understaffed, high stress, lots of hours. Been working 12hr days, opening & closing which is fine but not really much support from the rest of staff. Not bilingual and pretty confident that's what's going to ultimately end my employment there."
bad,"exclusive focus on statistics have allowed company to loose sight of mission, and resulted in poor performance lack of commitment to consumers has resulted in an aging customer base, and few new customers"
bad,"A typical day at work I might check out 10 customers, if it's holiday season it can get pretty busy. Nothing's hard about cashiering, but first coming in it could be a little overwhelming. Once you get the hang of things it's pretty easy. Working at Sears, I learned to not be afraid of interacting with my customers, which I am great at now. In the short time of me working there I had regulars that wanted to deal with only me, and got plenty of positive feedback. The majority of management was helpful and respectful, however management only cared about management. Sears as a workplace culture is just a dead end job. Period. They start you at minimum wage, raises are less than a quarter, and it's very hard to get one. The most enjoyable thing about working at Sears were honestly my co-workers, my regulars, and most customers."
bad,Job work/life balance was maintained well enough. Management not always adequate.  Lots of micro-management happening there.  Business not doing well as they are closing many locations.
bad,"Sears and Kmart are cold places. Definitely not friendly or fun. It's pretty easy to get in. If you are a cashier, you are expected to ask customers for their SYW rewards cards. If they don't have it, you have to ask them if they want one. And after that, you have to convince them to get a Sears credit card. You have to try to do this until they leave your line. Different departments are a lot better than cashier or service desk. The other departments involve store displays, tags, and moving merchandise."
bad,The General Manager was a very inexperienced young man.  The son of the owner.  He had a bad attitude and temperment.  It made it difficult to work.  They are closing down in 1 week.
bad,The backroom i worked in was very unorganized worked there for 3 years and nothing changed at all it was pretty bad. Workers are underpaid and never get paid overtime they work im glad i left.
bad,Sears is a decent place to learn how to fix appliances however their over abundance of policy and procedure can make it a dull place to work and makes what could be an easy going job very stressful
bad,"I work in the tool/lawn and garden/sporting goods section of the store in Bangor Maine, I make $6/hr plus commission, my average is roughly $9.65/hr. Management expects you to fulfill a large number of rolls that you're not trained for or given the tools to accomplish. (Comical coming from the tool department I know.) Training is 100% on the computer and has almost no logical application to the interaction with customers. Product information is never offered and almost impossible to find without spending hours researching outside of work hours. Management hounds on you for credit card applications and protection agreement sales when there are no customers in the store. Manager frequently berates staff, and offers little to no appreciation for any tasks accomplished."
bad,Management was more worried about hiding out in their office instead of helping out on the sales floor. Our place is under staffed and your life consists of that place and that place only. Store manager was more worried about going on vacation then actually being there. It would take forever to get anything done (example being it took over a month just to get them to replace the light bulbs in the bathroom because they were all out). The other staff members were fun to work with but that can only take you so far before you can't take the job anymore.
bad,It was a nice place to work when in high school and when in college.  Loved the support when graduated from college and flexible.  Only worked there during that time
bad,"It may have just been the store I was at, but I cried a lot because I felt trapped at a poopy job with a horrible manager and I didn't have enough time to apply/interview elsewhere. Besides the normal retail hours (that are terrible), the demands of the position were unclear and there was little to know training. I was thrown into the position and essentially left to fend for myself."
bad,This company is the worst company I ever work. They dont care about human relation and his management team is the worst in my life. They assign task impossible to do in the time they expect.
bad,"There is very little good that I can say about Sears right now. While my most immediate manager has been very good about scheduling around my needs, the higher up managers seem to be completely aloof of the situation at the store level."
bad,"I am currently working here applying somewhere else. But the environment is easy, cashiers decent, hours decent, management (I won't even bother) ."
bad,Worked for the company for years. Was able to go through many departments. The morale is low and managers give you little to no contact unless you make a mistake.
bad,hired me to fold cloths and thats it no advanecment only great for christmas seaso after that the will cut hours and give hours to favorites cool place to work
bad,"If a client doesn't call or email during the day there is no work and with everything being done internally there typically is no work. Thought I would get a lot more than I have out of this job at such a big company. Unfortunately, I have not. Unstable positions. People come to work just to come, nobody enjoys being here."
bad,"this was my first job and when i got hired i was happy , the first few months it was all good but then everything went down hill , they expect you to have a unrealistic amount of credit daily and if not they are on your back for the whole shift , as well as with their dumb rewards that are over the top stupid , the management is very careless , they will cut your hours if you dont get credit , poor pay and expect you to do other peoples jobs , wouldnt recomend it to anyone"
bad,Work isn't all that difficult but there is zero support from management. They always expect more from the few employees we have left. Being understaffed and underpaid is never an excuse and they just want you to work harder with no reward.
bad,Typical day at work was very stressful. Co workers were not friendly managers were not either. No one was on one accord when it came to asking questions no one hardly ever knew the answer.
bad,"This job was very difficult to manage at times, and sometimes required you to pick up more task than need be. Management was very poor, and communication lacked also. This job reminded me of High school with all the gossip and rumors. The other team members were ok and made working here a little less stressful. There is a noticeable favoritism of culture and racial background."
bad,Sears' official policy is firmly entrenched in the past. Managers are poorly paid and it is evident they could not be successful elsewhere. The company's official stance is that anyone can be trained for any job which completely disregards the inherent attributes of all people. The term Human Resource is wasted here.
bad,"The company was dying out, it excells at nothing and is okay at a few things. I wouldnt recommend this as a career, but as a first time job it isnt horrible."
bad,Hardest part of the job is working to my full potential and not getting any positive reinforcement. Very negative atmosphere. Negative management team.
bad,"The company has no sense of direction, SHC struggles to create a brand and support or maintain that brand. There is no room for growth within the company. Promoting from within is frowned upon."
bad,This would make someone a good first job. Not a lot of room for growth within the company. Health benefits that are offered are not very great.
bad,It's a company without growth opportunity. The associate is nothing for their. A little of coworkers are honest. The environment at work it's negative with the new administration. The supervisors are incompetent.
bad,"Supervisors and Managers don't communicate, benefits are not the greatest, many times you do not get full-time hours."
bad,"This place was just horrid. You treated customers poorly on a day to day basis, and it was taught to you that way. Poor management and no job advancement. Very poor place to work."
bad,Management needs to step up and actually monitor the training process. Putting the training responsibilities on employees who were not trained properly in the first place only perpetuates the cycle of associates who have no idea of what they're doing. This leads to poor customer experiences and increases the negative feedback that customers provide about Sears. The hiring manager also needs to make it clear that the job requires selling the store's high interest rate credit card to customers.
bad,"I would be at the ware house at 5:00am, load my own truck, do my  calls to customers and deliver and install appliances. threw out the day i would have (ETA)estimated time of arrival to deliver,so i feel this job gave me great skills in time management."
bad,"working there was very, confussing. it was a revolving door of associates leaving, new ones joining, hem being let go, just to start it all over again"
bad,"Humiliation"
bad,Could have done the store a great service if I had the training deserved. Lack of training gave me a disadvantage which compromised my presence working there. Not used to my best advantage and critically challenged constantly.
bad,"Great place to work. A nice body of employees who are always willing to help. The downside of working with sears is that you're constantly on your feet and during the winter time, they only turn the heat on certain departments of the store."
bad,"Es  bueno el trabajo, ya que todo trabajo es bueno , pero cuando no existe la motivación, el trabajo se vuelve malo, y mas aun cuando el ambiente de trabajo es malo, cuando tienes demasiada  motivación pero la empresa no esta lista para el contagio, lamentablemente no te sientes cómodo."
bad,The management does not do what they are supposed to and you are basically left unattended to complete tasks yourself. They do not train you properly either.
bad,"Your day can vary,from the schedule you work. Very long hours,which include violating the California labor law. They trick you into signing a agreement that you cannot sue,unless it goes to arbitration. One of a hand full of California company's that pay their managers by salary,instead of by the hour."
bad,"very poor management and training procedures. training was insufficiant for job function, and the management is completely incompetent. i wouldnt recommend this company to anyone."
bad,just pay your workers decently and invest in building your stores up again. its embarrassing to hear customers ask why the roof is hanging from a limb.
bad,"I worked here for about 4 months as a way to supplement my income as a second job. Hard times come upon us and I lost my primary job and this became my primary job. CE combined with HA and took over their pay grade which is commission vs the draw. I received no training in Home Appliances. I was expected to sale the products, sale a protection agreements and pressure people into applying for a sears credit card with an APR of 28%. When asked why all the manager could say did I ask to be trained? Are you kidding me? It is not my responsibility as the employee to request training it is your to make sure your associates are properly trained and have the knowledge of all products. I left after receiving another job offer (full time with benefits). I had to fight for a month to receive my final pay. FYI  SEARS it is a required state and federal law that you pay your employees for hours worked even after they have left."
bad,"Management has no clue of what they are doing from headquarters on down.  The Washington state store that I worked at is a joke.  They will take returns from ANY store (Macy's, Old Navy, etc..)  Managers wanted me to train people to do a job  that I was promised and already doing superbly and have me do a job that nobody wanted!  Co-workers were decent enough, although many were very lazy.  A typical day at work became chaotic with the company's contradictory rules.  One day we were supposed to take customer defective equipment in for repairs, they next day we were told to send them to another store, the next day we were told to give them a new item.  We never knew what the ""REAL"" company policy was, and they still don't know because they have the worst comunication I've ever seen in a ""major"" company."
bad,On a typical day everything would run smooth until their were personal problems effecting work. There was not any concern nor consideration from management as far as what held their employees back from excelling.
bad,"The stores are very slow paced, except for maybe the weekends. They have a hard time keeping employees to stick around, especially managers and cashiers. Management was fair. If your department is slow and the store needs help in other departments. you will be pulled to help. Which nothing is wrong with it, until they make you help other departments everyday your there, especially if you work in the mattress department. The goals are unreasonable when the store doesn't have much volume.  They constantly push for credit. They want you to get recaps, shop your way, and use that  i-pad which wastes time. There is no room to grow. Only enjoyable thing about the place , was the co-workers. Most of them are friendly and you may grow friendships."
bad,its ok for a college student and people are retired and just need something to do instead of sitting at home.  The management is not that great.
bad,"Sears Westminster was a caring environment that I enjoyed working at.  Sears aurora was a place where nobody seemed to care about anything.  The managers were pushed to hard, which caused them to treat employees inconsiderately."
bad,"Sales in "
bad,"The Sears company is a good company for young adults looking for a temporary job, while they find a career route. The structure of management is very poor."
bad,Just have to make sure your number are good. Always to improve your sales and make sure you are overall good in all your numbers
bad,"A typical day at work would just be checking out a few hundred customers and helping the customers solve any issues they had and informing them of things they didn't know about products they were purchasing or smart plans on items they were purchasing. I learned how to process money orders, cash checks, pay out lottery tickets, process western union, process returns, and process fishing license purchases on the register."
bad,This place is so focused on metrics that customer service and employee happiness. The management does not communicate.
bad,Asked for 20 hours a week and I ended up working 36 hours a week with 1 day off while I was still in school. Not ideal for students.
bad,No support from team members or management. Equipment didn't work. The phones didn't work. You weren't required to think. You never had assistance in your section.
bad,Its depressing how the company is going down and instead of listening to the people who actually speak to customers the higher ups are bringing the company down.
bad,"A good starter workplace for teenagers that need something on their resume. Not very good place to work at however. Low pay, management is poor and always changing, and no one cares about your personal needs or schedule."
bad,"Fixing merchandising displays, assisting customers, organizing merchandise"
bad,Sears was not a pleasant place to work. The company is not the sears i grew up with. A total lack of management and employees did not work according to policy.
bad,"I have been there for about 4 years. I have advanced, stepped down, and advanced. The most of the people are great, but the company and the manager are not. When you have employees of 35 years up and quitting after 6 months with a new manager, there is an issue somewhere."
bad,Typical day at sears is to start out by pulling customer orders from the internet then receiving the merchandise trucks unloading the trucks taking merchandise to the appropriate place in the stockroom and pull in store orders for customers
bad,"I was fortunate enough to come into Sears with an education, so I luckily made slightly more than other employees, however the compensation was still not worth the work for the position I was in. "
bad,"You will have 5 managers who will give you 5 different answers to your question."
bad,"Greet customers, ask questions to determine needs or wants, demonstrate products, promote warranty, accessories, financing & delivery."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find what they are looking for and most of the time brighten up their day with a kind word or so."
bad,This company over works their employees and treats them like garbage. Management doesn't even bother to interact with their employees.
bad,"When working for Sears Roebuck, it was fun at one point, sales calls are fun if you can change up your pitch from time to time. The script that is giving is boring."
bad,"You are hounded on your metrics, the company is actually divided into 50 sub compartments that compete against each other for resources like IT, the checkout and computer systems are out of the 1970's."
bad,I worked as a seasonal employee. Everyone was nice to work with. It was ok
bad,"Slow workplace, except for the holidays. Good management while I was working there. They made sure you were comfortable with your job before leaving you to do it on your own."
bad,"fast paced, smart coworkers, interesting type of work, high turnover"
bad,I was a sales associate who sold matresses but no one ever bought mattresses so I would just sit around all day even though I would've rather had been doing something fun.
bad,"At first, I really enjoyed my job here and thought many of the people were great. The longer I work here, the harder it is for me to feel motivated to go into work during my scheduled shifts. My coworkers are often rude to one another and always have gossip stories to tell. They are supposed to accommodate student schedules (as I am a student at IU) as best as possible and never schedule you when you specify that you are unavailable to work certain days and times. However, this has happened multiple times to me and it makes it difficult to keep up with school, classes, and my other jobs. Schedules are often changed without giving any form of notification, either, which can be very inconvenient when making plans for schoolwork such as group projects, and anything else that requries advanced planning."
bad,The fast paced environment kept helped to stay energetic. There was also commissioned bonuses to be added to hourly pay.
bad,The manager has solely been responsible for at least 50 people leaving if not more.
bad,"If you apply for part time. Make sure you set an availability. They will work you full time if you have a very open availability. So take 3 days a week where you don't work if you want a life. There is hardly any room for advancement and those advancement positions are not worth the pay for the stress and hours required. Co workers are either kids, retired people or those stuck in a rut. The hardest part of the job is knowing that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, it is never good enough and they make sure you know that. They give you coaching every few weeks and they make you sign it stating what you need to do better even though you could hit 9/10 things right, that 1 just wasn't good enough. Honestly, there is less stress for the same pay flipping burgers. The part I like most about the job is the friends I've made. Young, middle age, old."
bad,i was usally on my own and i loved that i also had dead line and i always got my stuff done before the dead line
bad,"Had to run multiple departments, always short staffed, barely any hours. Could never get anything done-always getting pulled away from your actual job"
bad,"The job itself is pretty run of the mill, no complaints about that. However, the outrageous amount of micromanagement done by managers that are egregiously under qualified for their positions really hinders the work experience."
bad,"Management was not leadership driven. They focused on tasks and not people development. "
bad,"Starting pay is below minimum wage due to commission but no one ever comes in that is really making it worth while my average pay was under $250 for two weeks."
bad,"There is no typical day at work. It seems like most of the time it's fire drill after fire drill.   "
bad,"They will let you work a schedule that fits your lifestyle. That is the only good thing about working there. The manager is terrible. She constantly tells people they are stupid in front of everyone. She will sit in her office and harass employees over a head set all day. She will make up rules and yell at you for not following them, even though you did not know they existed. If you ask for help, you will be yelled at. There is little and sometimes no training. They do not give raises and some of the upper management makes little enough to be on welfare. If you have a ton of patience for verbal abuse and don't need much money, this could be the job for you."
bad,Great way to shed some pounds because your always on your feet but the lack of education in management definitely shows!
bad,Working for minimum wage with no sign of a raise or advancement in the near future.  Sometimes a free lunch and schedule request are the only up side of this job.
bad,"Interacting with customers are great.  Meeting different people, is always an advantage to my job experience."
bad,"I work in the jersey city sears and I must say that after working here, I have gotten a bitter taste in my mouth from the customers, managers and how the company is run. For one the customers are so horrible at times, throwing clothes everywhere and leaving the dressing rooms in complete disarray. Then you have the managers, one in particular who talks to you as if you were trash if not worse. There are a lot times when there is actually no one shopping and when there are a lot of people, the place is understaffed. Also some associates leave the registers then other associates have to pick up the slack. The managers never fix the problems if you have any and your complaints and concerns are ignored. Also, they give you one schedule then change it so you have to readjust your life because of some last minute change that you were completely unaware of. Oh and to top it off, you are performing multiple jobs and yet your pay is so little."
bad,"work with incentive, make phone calls all over the United states, work in cubicles with 8 other employees . speed was crucial because work hourly pay plus commission."
bad,"I accepted a job as a loss prevention associate because in the interview the management team stressed leadership, team work, and investing in their people.  I was let go after 60 days.  I know I was getting better every single day, as I went in having separated from the Military with zero experience in retail loss prevention.  Sixty days is not an investment in someone.  It's a waste of time for both parties.  SEARS is cutting a lot of jobs, and cutting hours.  I was told I would work at LEAST 20 and no more than 30.  The first month that was true, then I was cut down to 16-18 hours.  I never had the chance to look into extra benefits, as I was there for such a short time.  My co-workers were nice, but some people view LP negatively, so be prepared for that attitude."
bad,I will not speak badly of an employer in writing however I would not work for this company again
bad,"Handling problem orders regarding credit cards and item numbers."
bad,"When you first hear the name Sears you are familiar with it and from what little you do know about it you'd assume nothing but great things. However, I find it no different from any other job that I have previously been with that had negative reputations. I am even more surprised that they do not have such, I feel that they are extremely disorganized  and the hierarchy have all left the company. most have been hired on by Lowes to take business away and the people that they hire should still be in high school and maybe paid someone off to pass the drug test. they also only pay appointment setters 9.00 per hour which I think is too little for the amount of back-lash that one must deal with from peers as well as dissatisfied customers."
bad,lots of false promises and lack of advancement opportunity
bad,"My review of Sear Holding Corporation/ K-Mart is that for a part time position they work around my availability. As a cashier, former floor associate in Men and Womens Accessories, a typical day is busy with customers and providing excellent customer service. There is nothing at all difficult about the job and I enjoy my co-workers company and customers each time I work. Unfortunately there is little room for advancement in the company, so a career is not an option at this point."
bad,"300 am till 1130 am no electronic equipment to unload trucks,markers and chalk.12.00 hr barely get 30 hrs a week,unload matresses by hand,very premative lot of manual labor. no chance for advancement in warehouse 1 cool coworker,out of 3.not really worth it .benefits very expensive. I moved on after about a month.might be alright for 18-  24 year old old that's single and childless."
bad,"Sales position for Sears Home Improvement is 7 days a week, driving from 1,000 to 1,500 miles a week with no compensation for wear and tear on your car. (No company car.)  My mileage for each year was between 37,000 and 45,000 miles a year.  Ridiculous for personal car.  Sales are slim because home improvement costs from Sears are double to triple the costs of competitors.  If you take a day off (like Christmas or for family events or sick) you are frawned upon.  You can only do appointments set by Sears, so if you take a day off, you are subject to only getting appointments that are bad and no way can sell a job. Management is super micro-managed and expected to come in the office every morning before going on sales appointments. Days start at 5am and lucky to get home by midnight each day.  Even though it may take 1 to 6 hours to get to an appointment, the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and dealing with the customers.  If you enjoy meeting people, the job is good for this, even with no sales.  Throw all this together, is the reason why Sears Home Improvement is downsizing because they are unrealistic in their cost proposals.  I tried hard for two years, have always been successful in sales, but could not make a decent living, especially when they send two on an appointment and must split the 5% commission."
bad,Sears is a basic starters job. It is a starters stepping stone to go into the real world. The co-workers are generally college students or single parents. The hardest part of the job is the pay checks. Due to the low pay checks its difficult to get by as a student but they do manage your schedule around your school which is a plus.
bad,its not a place you generally want to work the coworkers are great management is horrible overall they do nothing but walk around and if they see problems they just complain and make somebody do the work for them
bad,enjoyed a typical day there but did not like management and company
bad,No management involved until I emailed the higher ups for direction.  No training for other associates in how to act at work and what is and isn't ok to say or do.
bad,"Auto center open very early  at 7 am, I greet clients about their auto needs and repairs. I order auto parts if necessary.In do cashier responablities."
bad,The company reduced hourly rates and they don't follow thru on promised schedule.
bad,"I worked there for 9 years and every single year they came out with some hooray slogan for associates.  Your job was constantly on the line because the district manager would be at you store 2 times a week.  It was never about the customer but about the district manager visits.  The people were great I made a lot of good friends but they all either quit and got a well paying job or fired for a so called theft that a camera saw you but they don't want to show you.  The company does not give the associates raises.  They have been on a raise freeze for the last 5 years and the only way you can get a raise is if you move up and even if you do its 10-25 cents.  There are associates that work there but off but haven't had a raise in 5 years.  Managers are forced literally to stay overnight for the next visit and are constantly threatened by the district manager. I would type more but I would be here all day typing,"
bad,"i mainly did cashiering  and customer service."
bad,"At the time it was commission sales"
bad,"Too much focus on numbers, not enough time for customers."
bad,"Everything is very upbeat and cheerful when you begin. Then reality sets in. Everyone speaks about advancement opportunities, but really, there aren't many. "
bad,"my boss are very understanding."
bad,"Typical day of work consisted of co-workers misleading me, neglecting me, or simply passing me off to one another when they were suppose to train me. I learned that in order to succeed there I must do things alone and trust no one. The manager never had time for me or offered a helping hand when I reached out to him. My co-workers lied to me, they gave me false information, they stole my sales, they showed me how to slack off, and ways to not be caught sneaking off during duty. The hardest part was knowing that I was causing problems for the customers and no matter what they said to me I couldn't understand because I was unfamiliar with my department, and that quitting was my only option since help was never offered. The most enjoyable part was the fact is was in the mall."
bad,"Typically working a 4 1/2- 4 3/4 day with nonstop customers made for a shift that went by quickly. Management forces you to push for credit card applications and when you miss your goals your hours are severely cut. Inconsistent policies, one manager would say one thing another would say something completely different. On the plus side you work with a large group of people ranging from 18+. Holidays were fun."
bad,"I like my job, didn't like the people, the management, the pay, or the hours"
bad,They expect you to do too much work for too little money. Team morale is very low. No raises...too much emphasis on other programs vs focusing on sales
bad,"Sears is possibly one the worst employers I've ever worked for. The wages are very low, the company cares very little for the staff, and asset protection is forced to deal with ridiculous restrictions."
bad,"Good work enviroment "
bad,Corporate generally have the boys club culture and the call centers have restrictive rules ment to get people fired for doing their jobs.
bad,"Sears has horrible management, they dont back you up, they dont protect their employee's they treat all of their employee's like stepping stones. There is also a extreme amount of drama, which they show no interest in trying to control. It is a very selfish company, I'm not sure if its all of them, or just the one i worked at. But either way, I wont be back."
bad,"Horrible place to work for in almost every department. I started off as a loss prevention agent. I had over ten years of work experience in that field yet the Loss Prevention manager, store's manager, and district LPM put me at the lowest possible position with the least amount of pay and hardly any hours. In order to make detainments you first have to be ""certified"" by your LPM. How fast that happens depends on if he/she likes you personally. It took my LPM almost a year to ""certify"" me even though I had passed all requirements my very first week. He certified me his last day on the job, the same day I was hired in to replace him. Even though I had experience and had worked for them a year they still looked outside of the store for a LPM. That is Sears/Kmarts hiring practice all over America. When the economy took a dive Sears decided to cut and consolidate nation wide. Instead of just letting employees know they were being laid off or transferred the day that was decided they made the people wait an entire week. The company is run by quota's. every single department has insane quotas that you can be fired for not filling. Don't work there. It's a nightmare"
bad,"I worked long hours and overtime- I was always there when called because someone called off. I don't think that sears/kmart handles employees very well-- A supervisory position came open that I was more than qualified for. Another co-worker was promoted, well needless to say, she didn't show for work for 3 or more days with in the next week and was fired! I quit."
bad,Poor management and lack of motivators in the work place. Also did not enjoy constant up selling.
bad,Management does things they are not supposed to but its ok as long as no one finds out attitude. Just overall not a good place to work for if career growth is what you are lokking for.
bad,Worked their for 6 years and learned a lot. Tried to transfer to another state. Everything was set in place. When i moved tney didnt want to hire me. Im kinda glad. Very long hours. No help from management. They focus more on what you sell than what you fix
bad,"Sears only cares about credit applications. If you are pushing credit onto every customer, corporate loves you. Corporate cares nothing about the safety of employees and will keep stores open through a blizzard. Breaks are few and far between if you are not a smoker."
bad,"Good Place to learn customer service, learn to mutile task,but the hours were not flexible"
bad,No opportunity for advancement or pay advance. Knew many people working their 10+ years still at 7.25 hr. Managers are rude and don't care about your school schedule or outside life. Don't get compliments for work done and lazy coworkers as well. Break room had so many nats and bugs made it impossible to eat as well as the discusting refrigerators and lockers.
bad,i love working with people and helping the need of people love the discount when holidays i could get things at a good price
bad,I learned not to plan my day ahead of time. I managed to accomplish my tasks but had very little time to complete them.
bad,The management was terrible. The store manager was fantastic but some of the middle management was terrible. Loved the coworkers but the pay wasn't enough to put up with everything else.
bad,"Overall, the company is not a good place to work for now that Kmart has taken over. The pay is not good, neither is the benefits now. The 401k benefits were great before the take over and now, it is not sufficient. Lack of knowlege and equipment to do the job makes the job more contentious. Since the take over, the employee morale has declined tremendously."
bad,"I have learned Part time is for the slow worker, expecting to be notice after completing task throughout the day wolud not get me hours, approach business as a Manager with a workers mentality is how Ihave grown mentally"
bad,Job duties were to unload & load gay lords. then prepared then to ship out to other location .
bad,"Not great unless you have a higher up position, snobby bosses,"
bad,management can do plenty more to make it a welcoming work place.
bad,On a monday....I come in check the sales floor for reshop and clean up and straighten the whole electronics area. After that I prepare the till for the day and grab the keys for my department and find a sore gun to do my audit. As soon as the audit is done I finish cleaning up and get ready for the freight thats coming in off the truck.
bad,"A typical day at work was nice. I loved getting out of the house and being around people. I always have a smile on when I interact with people. I did have the occasional customer that was never happy. But I learned to just keep a smile on my face and deal with what they wanted to try and make the customer happy. I went to my job to work, but making friends in the process was great. I loved my coworkers and managers. We all got along great, which made the day go by even better."
bad,"No job security, no benefits. No consideration for personal life."
bad,"While i worked here, although i made great new friends, the work it self was very demading. Most senior employees put work off on the newer employees and management is not all that great. Half the time the have no clue what goes around in the store and expects way too much of the the employees seeing as we work on the sales floor."
bad,"Barely made minimum wage as a sales associate. Manager was a snake who lied and told his associate's to lie in order to achieve business metrics. My co worker's were the best part of the job, but like me, they have all quit. Stay away from Sears, they are going down a dark road. Any other retail place would be better."
bad,I went to work for Sears for two reasons. To be a supervisor again since my previous experience helped me develop hard working employees that exceeded company set objectives. The second was to help with process improvements so Sears could increase it's generosity like how it donates to Extreme home makeover. I was never so saddened about having to leave a job that really was starting to make a difference in the lives I interacted with on a daily basis. The request to discipline someone and possibly terminate their employment using inaccurate numbers was something my integrity would not allow. I can only hope that Sears is a different company then what I had experienced in my call center.
bad,"A typical work day would consist of helping customers purchase merchandise, light cleaning duty. Company is hardly ever busy. I've learned patience. Management can be unruly. I think managers at my Sears location could use training on how to communicate respectfully with employee's. My co-workers are wounderful and friendly. The hardest part of the job for me was tolerating the lack of communication and disrespect from management as an adult I believe you give respect and you'll receive respect and that wasn't neccessarily the case. My most enjoyable part of working at Sears is coming to work and associating with co-workers that will always have something to say or do something that'll brighten your day."
bad,Typical Day At Work:
bad,"I was usually left alone in the Shoe department at Sears and all of a sudden We would be swamped with people for hours. I was alone and the customers were getting angry. When I paged for help, no one would come even when there were workers not doing anything."
bad,"worked in electronics, so i learned how to sale a electronic product and speak to customers"
bad,"I did not have a problem with the work and I enjoyed helping the customers, the cashiers, and the amount of freedom I had when deciding how my work day was going to go. However, the day my mother passed away I was not scheduled to work so I called the following day to speak with a manager. Not one of them decided to call me back until day 4 when I let my favorite cashier and friend know that my mom had died and I would probably be resigning. I guess she let them know what happened and I finally got a call back. I received many apologies, but it's not as if I could continue to work there."
bad,"the hardest part of the job was lifting, management was easy to work for"
bad,Not a great place to work for
bad,there is no teamwork and everybody seems to not take pride in their daily task whatever it may be everybody tries to back stabb each other and alot of tattling over nothing of great importance.
bad,The boss doesn't real give help they just expect the to know.
bad,"Sears doesn't let you breath. Every day the management staff wastes your time going over numbers and it seems they are missing the big picture. The stores are cold in the winter and hot in the summer. They do not invest any money into the stores. Yet they have the sales associates use I pads now and can hardly ever get those things to work as intended. Greedy salespeople will steal your sales and make too much money that it causes Sears to hire more salespeople to go on the sales floor in a attempt to lower the greedy salespeople's benefit rate. Which means that we have an abundance of salespeople but never an abundance of customers. The quality of the products have dipped. The management staff are at the mercy of the useless district managers who just seem to blame all the things wrong with Sears on the associates. Sears wants to move the business online and it shows by them having better offers, coupons, and prices online. They will write associates up if we sell too many items online because online sales do not show up on the store sales numbers. So every online sale doesn't credit your sales goals. If you sold everything online you would look like you don't sale anything at all and you would get written up and put on a ""performance improvement plan"" where if you don't meet your goals for three months in a row then you get fired. I could go on and on that I feel I should stop before I write a book."
bad,"Working at Sears has been by far my worst job experience and as a result I never want to work in retail again. Sears should definitely be the last place a person should ever apply to if they cannot find another job. Management has no respect for the workers whatsoever. They make you work when they want you to work and they make you stay as long as they need you, even when your shift is technically supposed to be over. Don't expect to leave when your scheduled to leave, they will keep you usually an extra hour or two. You don't get any breaks, except a 30 minute break after five hours. You don't get anymore after that. The managers always want to see the workers working nonstop and not do anything else. You can't even stop to go to the bathroom or get a drink of water because they get upset if you do. The supervisors also expect you to go to work on the days you have off, if they call you to report to work. If not, they assume that you don't care about the job and don't want to work. I was reported to the Human Resource Coordinator once because I was called into work on a day I was not scheduled, but told my manager that I was not able to make due to activities I had planned for my day off. The manager got upset because I refused to report to work on my day off. Don't ever expect a raise either. One of my co-workers hadn't received a raise in almost 7 years."
bad,"Greeting customers when they come to pay their bills, make returns, or purchase items."
bad,"ready meeting in the am to set the tone of the day, custome service the rest tof the day"
bad,sucks!!!!it wasnt worth goen to work after a while idi it to pay bills.
bad,"It was a very slow time and if you like to try to look busy with no business, this is the place for you"
bad,The job is a stepping stone. My experience was inconsistent site placement. There were rarely any consitent sites that had sufficient pay. The company's reputation is slighted by the sub standard gaurds they have employed. I was used greatly to win contracts due to my professionalism. Shortly after I would be moved to another site so that older gaurds that were friendly with management could assume the position I won. I needed to move on because the position they had given me as a site supervisor did not include an increase in pay.
bad,"Management was under trained, morale was a constant problem and poor treatment of employees"
bad,Management needs work
bad,As an employee here you get to meet people from all walks of life.7
bad,A typical day at the job would include providing courteous customer service along with ringing up customers orders. We provided friendly service as well as learned how to be team members with other co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was having to leave due to relocating to another state but the most enjoyable part was being a part of so many people's everyday life.
bad,"I worked there at the busiest time (holloween to christmas) and the management would hardly gives us breaks, would require us to keep our phone on us if we did so they can call us back in."
bad,All management cared about was having the customer sign up for a Sears Credit Card. I can see why this whole chain will be gone in a couple of years.Its a shame because a lot of people I worked with have given a lot of blood sweat and tears working for this chain.
bad,Management will fire you just because you disagree with him. Management wants you to work outside of common sense abilities.
bad,"As an automotive technician for Sears, all I can say is Jiffy Lube looks better. After working at two different stores, the impression I get is Sears currently just plays number games. The equipment is poorly maintained, they fail to keep proper stock for safe work. They claim to provide tools, yet you're lucky to even find a common 10mm anything. The service advisers are more concerned with pushing more vehicles through (hard to do when people don't come in) while ignoring recommendations to alert customers of repairs needed. The pay structure is very low for the business generated starting at about 5.75 per hour base, and if you work your hard off as a tech one, you can hope to add about $1 for rotations, $3.75 for oil changes, and about $2 for 4 tires. All that can add up to almost $9.80 average one a very rare good week, commonly only getting enough business for maybe $8.50 an hour average. Training is pitiful for the position consisting of watching video's on a computer screen, half of them detailing what the CSA is supposed to be doing the whole time, then wait several months for a technician certification course (which is needed for official advancement). One thing that can be a plus, NO full time available, so good for students or people who want to stay living at home, not good for people who want to actually be professional technicians."
bad,The place of business was completely out of order. Things were frequently broke and rarely fixed. There were many problems with security. There was a severe amount of pressure on employees without any incentive what so ever.
bad,A great place to work for a part time job. A good place to learn about customer service. Learning marketing strategies to help with the sales and bring in more customers.
bad,"The store I worked at, you was lucky to get full time. Mostly 20 hrs a week. You only get raises if you get credit apps and maybe not even then. Even if you show up when you are suppose to and do other jobs to help out.. They push you to be pushy and don't take NO for a answer when asking people to apply for a Sears card."
bad,"Fun people to work with. Corporate treats people poorly, which is reflected in the upper level store management."
bad,La empresa seria mejor si no manejarán las solicitudes de crédito ya que lo anteponen a las ventas y como vendedor no te combine ya que casi no comisionas
bad,"They paid well, benefits were terrible."
bad,"Si vives  cerca de un Sears necesitas trabajo rápido y te sobra mucho , mucho pero mucho mucho  tiempo o no te quieren en tu casa Sears es para ti"
bad,"It was a job. Didn't pay much and didn't have good benefits, but at least I made a killing working over Black Friday and Christmas. I don't really know what else to say here, but I need to meet a rewuired 150 words..."
bad,"No stock, tools,gas card or pcard after 2 months.Alwas excuses to why van old wore out check engine light on junk all through it. Tech assigned to train me was overbooked and stressed to properly train. Typical drive to meet him was over an hour through bad traffic making me late then given grieve about it. The push to sell overshadowed making good repairs, clients angry it took a month to get there"
bad,everything was slow because the computers were outdated. management was horrible besides hardlines management. don't ever let your coworkers hand off a customer to you when they were in the middle of selling to them! even if they say they are busy doing something else! it makes the process more confusing and causes the customer to be upset.
bad,"Sears inevitable failure puts way too much pressure on management and employees especially. Cashiers are fired for not meeting unrealistic sales/credit application goals each month. The proper training is not provided to even make these goals. I happen to be a natural when it came to meeting these goals but the supposed bonuses are minimal. Management is overworked and in turn, always rude to the employees. Turn-over rate is the highest I've ever seen and there is no room for advancement in this struggling company"
bad,"Sears is a culture of negativity, they pay their workers too little. Ask their workers too much, and all wrapped up in a bow of constant negativity and belittlement"
bad,a typical day involved no one coming into the store and the managers telling you to constantly move stuff around to attract new customers when it does not work as well as causes a multitude of problems for everyone. Managers lied to me a said the store would not be closing and if it did we would have 16 weeks notice when in actuality in was closer to 8 weeks notice as well as they have been not handing out benefits and money that employees were owed.
bad,It was my first real job so I was fine making minimum wage. But then I was told by a worker who worked there for YEARS that raises don't happen. Then I got a five hour week and knew I had to leave.
bad,"My hours kept getting cut from lack of business. No chance of advancement. There were employees there that have not had raised in years, yet were doing the job of two or three people."
bad,"There wasn't enough pay provided for all the work asked. The store was understaffed as peak times of the year. On the other hand, there were some wonderful sales associates to work with."
bad,"I was hired as an appliance technician, but it soon became clear that technician ability was not as important as sales ability. There is far more emphasis on selling products and warranties than on customer service."
bad,"Tech managers hands are tied and can not sufficiently support techs in their duties. Upper management has no clue how where or how to rectify problems areas. They will ask techs for ideas but don’t really listen. Wages may seem good for a beginner tech but it doesn’t grow with the tech. Routinely worked 50-69 hrs a week including every other weekend, mandatory. Routinely adds extra calls near the end of day, prevents a tech to make plans after work"
bad,Stressful work environment with outdated programs and outdates systems that caused many problems for both employees and customers and unrealistic goals for the company to succeed.
bad,"empresa que no respeta a la persona, piensan que sus trabajadores son esclavos y los corre sin pagarle sus ahorros"
bad,"I've been working at the Silverdale Sears for years now. After dramatic changes in the company and management, things have really gone down hill. Some of the people are super cool and the sweetest people you'll ever meet, while others are quite the opposite. Would be a lot of a better job if corporate wasn't so awful and only cared about credit. Associates are constantly bugged to get credit applications. Only some people's lunches and breaks are cared about,  the rest have to go ""on their own time"" and leave their department which just results in loss of sales and increases shoplifting. Current manager is dissapointing and has no idea what she is talking about. Store is very understaffed and not given enough hours. Everyone is either new, leaving/looking for a new job, or is waiting for the store to close. In the end though, a job is a job and its a way to gain retail experience."
bad,The job wasn't too difficult but the level of training was not up to par. There was a lot of things that I did not know until after I had worked there a couple of weeks. There was a lot of on the job training which made it hard to try and be innovative and help the customer out.
bad,"Sears was probably the worst job I had ever gotten. I was lured in by (what I thought was good pay) when I first started. Then after the 1st year, if I got any raise, it was mostly an insult. The first and second manager I had were pretty decent and really tried to help. After those all other managers were awful. In the 6 years in Rochester we had 4 different managers."
bad,"Honestly when i worked there i thought it would be nice, my co workers gave a great work environment for the most part, i learned quite a lot of things while working there, but the main issue i had was that the management was sloppy and over bearing, they didn't offer any real advancement from the inside and the hours they gave to new sales workers were minimal to none and you were expected to make sales and hold impossible higher numbers to gain more hours."
bad,"slow business days, heavy requirements for meeting specific metrics against cashiers and sales men, that were hard to meet, but some of the coworkers were exceptional people to work with"
bad,"nothing to write, u can read on google news. wrong higher level management, wrong time to choose the diffrent path in sales., but realy some nice hard working lower level managers and workers. very sad."
bad,Does not give pay raises with evaluation. Does not use a recognition for associates program. The open door policy is not protected against retaliation. Store manager was not fond of anyone that was not Hispanic and also conducted  store walks in Spanish.
bad,"management does not help or aid with anything.  they only offer criticism without empathy.  restrictions are too high to get new qualified contractors and people all around have been llet go without warning under the guise of ""restructuring""."
bad,Stores are closing. Was a nice place to work until all the stores started closing around my location. Had to switch jobs in fear that i would not have one soon.
bad,"helping the customers with purchases, ringing up purchase and finding product. letting customers know about any features and or benefits to product to help with their decision of purchase."
bad,"Always some sort of drama and people trying to drag everyone into it. Managers often sitting in their office unless the girl they're currently talking to is there that day. You can say you can work certain hours and have them promised to you, then wake up with your schedule half filled with shifts on days or hours you can't work and not get them back giving you an eight - twelve hours work week with them then expecting you to basically work on call. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Just maybe an easy starter/ stepping stone job."
bad,"working at sears was a great experience, working with customers in the hardware department, loved the people I worked with, but their is no future in sears no moving up in the company, and was here 2 years and no raise."
bad,Sears Appliance and Hardware has been closed since August 2016. No need to write a review of this company since they have gone under. While there no recognition and no opportunities for career advancement.
bad,"Starting out was fine, I had ample hours, they are a bit forceful for getting cashiers to have people apply for the credit card. It wasn't until the next set of managers came to the store and changed everything around. Floor sales associates and Cashiers were dissolved into the same job and requirements. My hours were cut to 4hrs a week and often just Sunday morning. What did it for me was the one manager who had no idea what she was doing, yelled at me for her own incompetence, and drove everyone else to quit. My last day I was helping someone and she yelled at me for it."
bad,"Sears started out being a great place to work, but then a very productive manager left and the store lost its leadership. They stop offering associates room for advancement and made the employees feel complacent."
bad,"Everything except for co-workers you can meet at this company is garbage. Garbage pay, garbage management, garbage quality of job, garbage customers, and I'm glad this place is dead."
bad,"The work environment was not professional at all, there jobs where assign with no explanation or training. even though it was like that the job got done and learn how to work by myself with no supervision, the management very irresponsible, good people no professionalism I only talking in my department, not all department are like that some are really good, no workplace culture, they where people making the wrong decision and saw how much money got thrown away."
bad,"There were times where we could sit in the stock room and not worry about anything. Since nobody shopped at Sears sometimes, we spent about an hour or more touching the store up, but then have nothing to do. So we sat around. When people did come, the managers were horrid at customer service and failed to appeal to the customer to bring them back. Sometimes one person was required to cover a few departments which made no sense. And sometimes during busy hours. It is relaxed most of the time, especially if liquidating, but when it is not, it is handled poorly the store. We got free food sometimes but that was mainly during liquidation."
bad,"Management not so great. Hours aren't very flexible. You get off work when you're done, which can be stressful for families with kids or going to school."
bad,Management was not aligned on the top priority and goals across all functions. Talent was not leveraged to full potential. Lots of redundancies across many departments.
bad,"If you plan on working without wanting to put a gun to your head soon after working there, do not work for these people. Very people to work for! You will regret it!"
bad,"Was my first job and was in college at the time i set my availability when I applied and at the interview but manager would schedule me when I couldn't. I had to call in every week asking for her to re-do my schedule, was very frustrating. Could only cashier and they wouldn't allow us to leave register at all."
bad,"The store failed due to poor management. With the arrival of the store manager, they chose to take on the duties of all the department managers and would not delegate tasks down the chain of command. As the store started to decline and departments began to turn to anarchy employees were forced to resign as scheduling was incorrect and staff became short."
bad,"Great starter job"
bad,"a typical day was okay"
bad,This was a good initial job. There is a lack of staffing and very poor management. Overall the company is disorganized. Pay is not enough for the amount of work required and no options for pay raises. Temporary job at best.
bad,Manager kept hassling you to make customers apply for a credit card there. annoying customers.they always made you fold the clothes when you didnt have customers and would get made if you didnt ask for credit apps.
bad,"My direct supervisor was a fantastic manager, he was aware of the terrible upper management and made work bearable. Upper management did not care about employees."
bad,"Poor upper management. Stressful  dealing with customers that are upset with the company as a whole. Company took Away benefits.  Their reasoning was due to bad economy, although in a bad economy people are more likely to repair rather than replace .  The same year they stop contributing to our 401, took away one sick day and stop giving out raises they had record-breaking Profit for that year. Although many technicians tend to be in their positions for a long time and are dedicated to the company, the company is not dedicated to their technicians."
bad,I was miserable working for this company. The management personnel were way to hard on there employees and forced the employees to make sure the review of there business was solely based on the employees interaction with the customers. Very unprofessional.
bad,"Sadly, I feel that management is pushed to produce sales instead of quality repairs. If you are good at working the system, you can actually thrive. My own moral compass is steering me away from this culture."
bad,Cost of benefits are high.  Paid time off is horrible.  No sick leave in Va for the company.  Management work against each other.  Broken processes that nobody seems to want to fix.  Customer service is horrible and the register system is from the 1980's
bad,"poor management "
bad,"Spending hours on your feet is not for everyone.  Working at Sears was not exactly an opportunity for growth or career development.  If you are looking just to make a bit of extra cash then perhaps its for you.  Or, if you enjoy retail period then maybe the job is for you."
bad,"Management was very unorganized, which led to a lot of people quitting and leaving the store very understaffed. The managers would often be hired and then never trained, so they didn’t really know how to run the store."
bad,As a sears cashier it feels like the company has no respect for you. They over work the cashiers and expect a lot from them. There is no incentive to perform well because they do not seem to care if you are a great performer.
bad,"There is no reason for Sears corporate to be located in Hoffman Estates, other than corporate tax benefits, or restrictions to leave the facility. Executive staff does not interact with management or workers, there are legacy employees randomly located throughout the infrustructure in Hoffman Estates. If they wanted to revitalize the company they would relocate all positions downtown and close the graveyard that is Hoffman Estates."
bad,its a job I wouldn't stay long due to I'm not sure if the company will eventually go out of business.To me every company has favoritism that's just how it goes just do you job no issues.FYI there no raises
bad,I Would give my all and it would not be appreciated. they required to much of my time. I Didn't get a raise (that i earned) for 4 years and when i did it was %5. My manager wound up leaving and wanted to hire me at his new company but no positions available. i did however appreciate Sears for teaching me to Repair appliances. I really liked working for the customers i had. They would call Sears and request me.
bad,"One week they would schedule you for 40 hours, one week they would schedule you for 5. not good for someone who needs constant money. Good for a young person starting off."
bad,Sears was a cut-throat place to work. Some employees would try and change previous sales made in order to get other employees commission pay that was owed to them.
bad,"I was a appliance delivery and installer and was paid minimum wage. there was no advancement, there was no benefits. had to work sundays which there was nothing to do"
bad,"Me resulta difícil creer que una empresa que vende decenas de Miles de pesos al día pague un sueldo tan mediocre,"
bad,"They make policies and they only stand by the ones they need to, they do not apply to everyone, they pick and choose who they want them to apply to. Raises are a joke and don't exist. It's a sad company to work for."
bad,"A typical day of work was always slow paced, yet my store manager would always find some weird projects to have the management do like rearranging a signing room or something, instead of doing our actual day to day responsibilities. All or most team leads or managers had to eat with the store manager otherwise you were talked about badly behind your back at their ""work lunches"", upper management (SM,ASM) were almost always too lazy to walk up front to where my cashiers and I were to address any customer issue they would demand over the phone I walk them all the way to the back right corner of the store where their offices were, whilst almost always leaving a line because we would only ever have myself and 1 other cashier on shift."
bad,"Poor Pay"
bad,There was a lot of lack of management for this job I was really worried on how my payment was going to come when I first started and a lack of employees.
bad,"I don't enjoy work anymore. All the managers will tell you something different. Some spread rumors about you to other associates if they don't like you. They are constantly yelling at me to be faster, while I'm doing 10 tasks at a time. There are some cashiers there that will always be defended because they get a lot of credits, even though they never help do anything else. Even though you may be a hardworker, great at organizing, fast at doing web orders, get member feedback, they'll still treat you unequally and get upset cause you didn't get enough credits. This job isn't worth the minimum wage. No benefits, no raises. Sears can't even afford any full timers."
bad,"management does not help. sale associate does not get paid enduing to deal with ""sear"" customers.  Nothing works right  a lot of customer issue and management does not want to deal with them"
bad,Hacen ventas nocturnas casi cada fin de semana y nunca pagan horas extras ni pagan el taxi
bad,Co-workers are friendly and helpful. The management is a joke. You are given a different answer from every manager. None of them are even in the same book let alone the same page.
bad,"The management here is only worried about one thing and one thing only: making money for themselves by any means possible.  I am aware that I was only a seasonal hire, but I couldn't even bear to work through the entire holiday season"
bad,"Sears used to be a good company. But when someone brought the company in the mid- two thousand and turned it into Kmart, that is when it started to go down hill. And the resection did not help either. Just don't apply there if you need a full-time job. The managers don't seem to care about their employees, you are on your own a lot of the time. The manager will not do their jobs; However you can sometimes find a good manager witch is rare at sears. Sears is only for people who want to earn a little extra money for gas or for Christmas. Don't try and make it a career."
bad,"Lack of communication by upper management, no career advancement options.And the salary or compensation is not worth wasting their time and energy for hardworking"
bad,Sears Holding is loss ing there business rapdily and company is huge debts. They are firing peoples day by day. Dont know where it will end. Management is very micro.
bad,"Just your typical first job during high school. Horrible retail customers and managers just care about sales and credit card applications. Not to mention, you didn't get part of your paycheck if you didn't get enough credit card applications. Who's going to apply for a card with roughly 30% interest??"
bad,"Sears is dying. Very few customers in the store, at times assigned to obtain leads. Most customers in the store were not indicated, interested or qualified for services offered."
bad,"sears pay does not match the amount of work that you are doing on a day to day bases, but there are a lot of good people that you interact with. Also when you are hired to work  8-4:30 you would think that that will be your set scheduled because that's what you told. they changed the bonus structure until impossible to be a good bonus. when you're use to getting 300.00 and 400.00 bonus every pay period. A lot of people have quit and there are some that we're let go for various reasons."
bad,"no one is actually working.  a lot of people waiting to see their department downsized.  huge number of people trying to look busy.  no one believes in the company anymore, everyone is looking for something better."
bad,I would suggest this job only if you have other means of compensation. Minimum wage paying job. Relaxed environment and very easy job. Little to no training is needed.
bad,Sears taught me how to sell. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell credit cards to customers. The workplace was really slow days. Sears does need a culture change.
bad,"The Kennewick Sears is ridiculous to work for. They expect EVERY customer to sign up for a credit card. They also expect each every sale to have a warranty, credit card, membership and addon supplies to be tagged on to it."
bad,"Can be an enjoying job at some points. Always too much uncertainty regarding work days. It was virtually never known what time a person would actually get finished at the end of the day, or evening to be exact. Had to anticipate more calls to be added to your route extending the work day much longer."
bad,Manager in union gap named tino barrera wont let a male apply for part time unless if you're a girl. Replaces his best employees with people that lack the requirements that he knows personally.
bad,"I loved most of the people but there was WAY to much emphasis on pushing the Sears Charge Card. It's like, their lifeblood...you get ""talked to"" if you don't ask every....single....person to get a Sears charge. Even if they are obviously not happy to begin with...it's very very uncomfortable and unreasonably high pressure. The individuals are really wonderful though...I was only seasonal and didn't get enough people to sign up for charge cards so they let me go after the season was done. Management was nice enough but again, the ""PUSH THE CHARGE CARD"" thing was all important. A lot of employees there fear for their jobs as stores all over are closing so job security is suffering considerably."
bad,"Would show up only to be told no work, laid off for month at time, communication with higher ups was lacking, safety was neglected, and supervisors was only concerned about their bonuses , an not employees..."
bad,Sears is a good place to work at but the store manager was bad and ruined a good place and a good staff. Sears needs to learn to hire better managers.
bad,It was a job while I was still in school can’t really say much more dreaded everyday quite hostile work environment although slightly impossible I believe to get fired unless you just don’t come in and Facebook post that you quit
bad,"No job position, rarely allows to perform the position hired for"
bad,"you would like to work there... but don't.  alot of stuff,  just purely is not true.  I work there,  but, seriously,  it's a joke. not a place you want to be."
bad,Was cashier. One of the front end supervises was cut throat...she was harder on guys and easier on woman...a real b___tch if you know what i mean. I was the mr nice guy and great cashier....all they care about is those stupid credit apps that customers did not want. Could of been a great job if it was not for that cr_p. I left because the pay really does suck...they would pay you less if it wasnt for min.wage law.
bad,"Right hand never knows what the left hand is doing, management is never on the same page and higher up management expects Store side managers to break company policies per their direction with the consequences falling on the lower grade managers"
bad,"It was too slow paced, not a lot communication from trainers, constantly saying give me a minute which never happened. Bathrooms not available at times."
bad,"Nothing at Sears was cooperative. Teams in the same department were all heavily competing with each other. During my three years at Sears I went through 3 different bosses, each one more horrible than the last. The job does pay well for what it is. Your workload depends entirely on what team you land on. If you are the type of person that can willingly watch others do the wrong thing and just barely coast through your job it's a real catch for the salary. If this type of thing would make you rip your hair out, stay far away."
bad,A blue collar retailer that wanted to become a white collar retailer because  Now they want to be a Amazon like company on a shoestring budget which nets large negative losses every QTR for the last 4 years.
bad,es muy poco el apoyo hacia el tebajador y muy poca equidad conforme a la hora de horas extras
bad,"Job didn;t offer any full time hours, benefits, or above minimum wage salary.  Poor development of staff.  Required employees to sell the credit car in order to get more hours."
bad,"You get paid to stand around, but the managers are always on your back if you don't get someone to apply for a credit card or if you didn't sell enough product."
bad,"P/T position yet unable to get fixed shift to combine with second P/T job - in spite of signed agreement."
bad,I cant believe they have jobs posted on here. There are plenty of people who have lost their jobs because of store closings and plenty more when all the stores close. This is truly disgusting. The powers that be ran this company into the ground.
bad,"Worked here for close to a year and walked out of that place miserable and excited to leave. Management was horrible and intentionally made the job more difficult when SEARS / KMART cut back on their pay. "
bad,"Always overworked, a crew of 10 became 4,but the amount of work stayed the same and at times even increased, equipment was always breaking-down, the wrong people was promoted, big politics about everything, management gave special treatment to some people and neglected others, the best workers would do most of the work while the poor workers would get the credit, this was my part time job, that's why I lasted so long, I could never have work here full time."
bad,I have been working there for a few years. The management kept changing their mind. Always needed to work overtime. Everyone is working under stress. The whole culture is not healthy.
bad,Not worth it. What a joke of a place. Management never truly had an idea of what they were doing. An unappreciative place that can be painstakingly stressful. Coworkers can either be helpful or overly critical.
bad,"managers were incompetent, they didn't care about anything, employees could do whatever they wanted, everyone hated their job, paid poorly, sears is probably the worse department store"
bad,Company going under and upper management has no idea how to do anything.   I was in the auto department  and district manager was an idiot.  Had no idea on how to run a team.   District manager will help take the company under.
bad,"will never apply again, unsafe work environment. unsafe management skills. poor use of company time.would not recommend this to anyone until they upgrade there management team"
bad,Training is very help and professional You are put on the floor with experienced workers You have schedule breaks and the lunch and break area are for smoking and no smoking
bad,I would not go back because their culture shattered over the past decade or so. No employees were motivated to work hard for personal or professional goals. The culture just died.
bad,I spent 17 years with Sears.  At first it was a great company with plenty of advancement.  Then things started to change with new Corporate Executives and their vision for the Company.  I left due to the loss of all that was good for so many years.
bad,The Management at Sears are typically reactive managers and they lack the planning skills required for a functional manager. They are usually very demanding because they either failed to plan and or they did not receive the required hours needed for  the completion of projects by Sears corporate. They then take labor allowance hours from successful departments and distribute them throughout the store for projects in other departments. As a result you have departments who should have additional hours for coverage but those hours are no longer available. I enjoyed the employees and the customers!
bad,"Most enjoyable area of the job was to attend people all while feeling comfortable doing so per se making sales, answering questions, cashiering. Management on the other hand wasn't so satisfying, there was plenty of false promises, unsatisfying on hands training and no benefits to work up to."
bad,Unfortunately my experience at sears wasn't the best it was an extremely dysfunctional experience. My heart goes out to the managers because their plates are so full they dont really have the capacity to train a new employee whos got to learn all the codes and rules. was difficult. very difficult
bad,"unloading and delivering customers their orders, learned how to make my organizational skills better, very poor management and never was happy about the amount of effort put in, wasn't a good work environment for employees"
bad,"If you have time to give away, choose this company. You have to fight for your commissions. Management is not fair in handing out leads. Leads are not verified. Expect to work 60+ a week for little pay and little training."
bad,Sears could be a very fun place to work other than the fact that they cut your hours if you do not sell enough credit cards every day you work. They prefer to use negative reinforcement rather than positive and openly threaten associates jobs.
bad,"not a good place to work, managers follow employees around, just makes people uncomfortable .if you need a job they will hire you the pay is childish . they have safety quizzes but give you the answers ."
bad,"Great source for tools, lawn equipment and work clothes. you can always find what you're looking for at Sears. everything from baby clothes to rocking chairs"
bad,I do not wish to disclose too many details about this position considering I really don't like it here at all anymore. It's a shame this great retailer fell so far.
bad,"Even though it was a pretty easy job, the people and the management team wasn't that good and most of the time it seemed like they didn't know what they were doing."
bad,"sears isn't doing well as a company and the effects of that will affect your job security and compensation. like all jobs these days, pay is at a steady decline."
bad,"My position was in field sales for the home improvement division of the company. Work generally starts at home until you have downloaded your leads for the day. Typically those leads are geographically spread out and this causes travel times from two to eight hours a day of net driving time.Typically 2 - 4 leads are issued per rep. Every Tuesday, even the ""satellite reps"" would have to travel to Sacramento to attend a mandatory and unpaid sales meeting. Sometimes the managers would joke about how they're taking such good care of the employees, they even feed them... While the training is good, the managers care very little about you as an employee or as a person (even if they pretend that they do). It's almost impossible to maintain a social life or any outside of work obligations when working for this company. They sing praises for the few fools who work seven days a week to encourage others to do the same thing. Since this is a fully commissioned position, you're only making money when you turn in sales. Now this is where it gets tricky: Commission discrepancies are something you'll be dealing with on a weekly basis (mainly because you don't have the time to do it on a daily basis). The only enjoyable part about this job was that you could make a lot of money despite lacking the time to spend it and that you got to do it with nice colleagues who are in the same foul situation as you are."
bad,"Long hours, low pay for the jobs your expected to do.  Some supervisors are incompetent. Hardest part of the job is a general lack of direction due to the corporate culture."
bad,"A typical day at Sears included greeting people before entering and after entering the Showroom. Gather info and assemble work order to include:  VIN number. license plate number, mark dents and scratches, tread depth, abnormal tire wear indications. Asking questions to make free general inspection offers based on mileage and overlooked maintenance in the past. Once service was being rendered, I contacted customers to convey recommended services by techs. Constant cleaning of Show Room and arranging company promotions and floor plans. Cash-out customers and explain warranty details on goods and services purchased. Communicating with Techs and Service Manager continuously to efficiently estimate completion on services rendered - minimal inconvenience to Customers oriented."
bad,"As a corporation, none of the employees felt as though our opinions about workplace rules mattered. Nothing ever went beyond store management as far as changing policies that were extremely unfair to the employees. I do owe my co-workers a lot for teaching me hands on how to do the tasks for my job. helping customers felt very rewarding as that was my main task for my position."
bad,"Had to fight over sales, getting cussed at in front of customers. The job is very nonprofessional and they do not care about how much money you made only if you sold a credit card."
bad,Good as a first job or if you are a student.The pay is not good and hours are very low. They also push you to sell the sears card. Advice is to find something better asap.
bad,"This company was outdated when it came to how things move now in retail. No job titles, employees are on their own when it comes to what and where to go when the shift starts."
bad,"work for sear home services was won of worst companies I have ever worked for. They have no loyalties to their employees and would work to limit what they had to pay any commission  employee without having to show what charges they were ding you with. Extremely long work day from 8am to midnight 6 days a week, driving sometimes 300 miles in a day between customers job sites."
bad,"Numbers are very tight around Sears auto, profits must be up and cost must be down. You will be worked hard and the company will attempt to put as little money into you as possible."
bad,Need more money management is terrible Day by  day you will be in suspense about having a job everyday. The customer are sweet and the item have great deals
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful because they don't have enough people to work. Everyone keeps quitting from here, and they treat certain employees better than others because of their high percentages in credit or the shop your way program enrollment. The hardest part of the job is having to do other peoples tasks or job because there isn't enough people to work. There aren't really any enjoyable days for me."
bad,This company has become a high stress place to be employed. Long term associates are just waiting for a package to be offered. Management no longer is willing to work with associates to provide a challenging and satisfying place to work.
bad,Thought from the beginning Sears would be a great place to work knowing the company has been around for 100+ years. Shortly after being hired in I noticed why the company is seeing its way out of the business door. Work days were too relaxed then when there was work it just happened to be enough for a few to keep busy. I happen to be a college student athlete so my time is very important and super tight with that being said Sears had a very weird way of scheduling me. A shift that started 10 minutes after class made it very difficult to get there on time. If you're looking into Sears just read up on the company before you take a job here. They may be going out of business for good soon.
bad,"Sears is evolving on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this means lay-offs. It's for this reason I would not recommend Sears to a friend seeking employment."
bad,Not the greatest place to work. The Sears Outlet Company is not a good company to work for. They do not value their employees and do not give them the tools to succeed.
bad,"I worked at Sears for over two years. It started out alright, and I liked the people I worked with, but the place went downhill fast. By the time I left, the store was a mess and morale among employees was at an all-time low. Thngs were constantly changing, resulting in confused and angry customers. The management is awful and the people above them are even worse. Non-commission employees were paid minimum wage with no raises, ever. Hours were constantly cut back -- to the point where we had to close our department before the store even closed! Customers were never happy about that either. After that they started cutting back staff and combining departments. As far as I can tell, they are still scrambling. In short, I hated the place and couldn't wait to get out!"
bad,"Constant harassment for credit card applications were a commonality within the store. Towards the end of my time there, hours were dramatically cut forcing one cashier to open and one to close. Time were you had long lines and no help were often. No one cared to help. Everyone wanted to quit. No one was happy there."
bad,"The job was very productive, this is a corporate company that does receive a lot of customers a day. My co-workers were ok, some of them did have attitudes, but its normal in any work environment. The job did consist of a lot of walking, and talking, some communication skills are keys in a job like this. From time to time it did get boring, but it was full of customers for the most part."
bad,To say Management did not care about associates would be an understatement. They would rather break company policy and make workers look bad then support them.
bad,"Company has been systematically going out of business for years, milking assets and preparing to go under. The business plan is not a business plan at all."
bad,They work with you on your  schedule when it comes to personal issues. Good benefits with dental and health insurance. Also with short term disability and maternity leaves.
bad,They want you to be more of a salesman of warranties over being a technician. Schooling is terrible because all information given does not pass down to the district level. Each district does thing different so leadership throughout the company is never on the same page. Computers are old and have to be rebooted several times during an 8 hour day. The cell service box in the van is terrible and lucky if it works for a whole shift!
bad,"I loved my previous job.  The work was interesting and my fellow coworkers were awesome.  Unfortunately, when you work for a company that is losing money, a lot of decisions are made that are not good for the associates.  This is the case at Sears.  I wish them the best.  Also, no raises or bonuses while I was there for 11 years.  Actually took pay cuts as they decreased our medical benefits and increased our portion of the premiums."
bad,I found management to be very disorganized an inconsistent.some people would get reprimanded for calling off while others had no consequences. I felt like I was trying to win rank in a high school peer group rather than working with a group of adults. The manager I had was terrible and very seldom followed company policy. I ultimately left because I could not handle the stress of my department being so mismanaged.
bad,"Unless you are in a consultative sales position or management, you will get paid minimum wage with no merit or cost of living pay raises ever. Your hourly wage will not increase until the state mandates a minimum wage increase, no matter how long you work there. Oh, and there is no longer an associate discount, you get rewards points added to your Shop Your Way account instead."
bad,I was seasonal help during the holidays and worked in what they called their dot com department which is just getting and shipping online orders.  What can I say about a store on the verge of total collapse.  Their management style is out of the eighties when malls ruled.  They do not pay anyone but management a decent wage.  I felt sorry for the people that had been working there 10+ years because they will end up with not much from their hard work.
bad,"At Sears, you are expected to force customers into applying for credit cards at any cost necessary. This can be difficult to do and impacts the hours you receive when you do not meet the standards. The expectations are ridiculous for a company that sees minimal customers everyday."
bad,"Many opportunities to be challenged, learned about marketing strategies, technology related to marketing campaigns, circular creation with web-driven applications, Loyalty program applications and tools and how to test user interfaces and integration testing with point of sale."
bad,"Help customers with buying or returning tools for exchange, assist in helping customers with lawn and garden, load items for customers, stock items in store"
bad,Estoy agradecido por la oportunidad que me brindado pero no   hay oportunidades de crecimiento
bad,Working at sears was once a good thing to me until I figured out that working at is boring and slow paced. They have a lot of older customers that tend to be a little rude.
bad,This job is fast-paced with little to no recognition in achievements. I left this job because I was basically running the floor on my own and not getting any recognition.
bad,The company was initially great to work for till they got bought out by Kmart. I worked on commission - customers were plenty and there was money to be made.
bad,There is a reason Sears stores are closing. Bad investments poor management and not taking care of employees. Its a sad day when one of the country's biggest respected retailers goes under because it has lost touch with its customers
bad,They do not give you the hours you need and they always cut hours.you get no employee discounts or any other benefits.they expect to much work to be done in to little amount of time.always short handed with customers needing help.it goes on and on
bad,"Commercial was a great business, for a while. Now, like the rest of Sears, it's dying a slow death due to mismanagement and a lack of vision. ""Retiring"" 12 years before I'm ready in order to leave a deteriorating situation."
bad,It is a rushed environment for no profit. Basically a store that thieves go to because the management is too focused on anything but customer service. Not much else to say.
bad,Aucun retour sur investissement et aucune valorisation de l'engagement des équipes.
bad,Managers did not care. Employees did whatever to pass the time. Customers were disrespectful. Point system wasn't the best. 15 minutes breaks. Dirty work environment
bad,"They're an ok company to work with but not a job to stress about over. There's no security to watch over the store when a thief steals an item. Manager seems careless to people's problems, forces you sell store credit and if you don't they will fire you. Managers walk around all day doing just about nothing until you call for assistant for a customer then no manager is available or around. Mostly coworkers enjoy working with each other and break time."
bad,Stressful and rude management. You will feel like you are always under pressure to meet your quota and are rarely provided the tools to meet it. Co-workers hate the job just as much as you will
bad,You are asked to produce incredibly sales numbers and when those number aren't met your hours are cut short. Management is mostly young individuals who seem to enjoy there job for more socials aspects instead of actually working.
bad,sears is basically a job for teens. do not look at sears for a career. i was a cashier at the young age of 16 and did labous task. it was good job while going to school.
bad,"I learned a lot about tools"
bad,I learned a lot of new processes and procedures with this job. This position involved me greeting and meeting customers needs as well as setting floor displays and assisting other positions. The hardest part was coming to terms with having other people that I worked with not taking their job as seriously as I was. Management was difficult as well because they did not discipline at all. I really liked being able to serve the customer and I enjoyed it when I satisfied them.
bad,"Company going under .. liquidating as I post, spent 7 years at a failing store to be lied to at the end about severance pay. No employee loyalty, poor management."
bad,Everyone is miserable and hates coming to work. The pay and benefits are terrible and the culture is just one of constant fear being instilled into the employees. No positive reinforcement when anyone does anything right and no pay increases for those who are reliable and work hard. They just give out negative feedback and all they care about is making the customers join the rewards program and sign up for store credit cards. I have worked there for a year and I work really hard and have never got a pay increase and because I am only part time I get no benefits whatsoever. Everyone there is stressed and unhappy and they have a terrible time keeping anyone because it is an awful place to work.
bad,"Sears was an ok place to work at the people were kind. Management was ok when they were there. The managers where to thin, it would take about 30 - 40 mins to get one to answer you."
bad,"The managers were poor and customers constantly complained about how much sears was going down hill. I was forced to sell people credit cards ""my job depended on it""."
bad,si aprendi con las capacitaciones de los instructores yo hacia dos area electronica y línea blanca y con el mismo sueldo nunca se cumplio el aumento de sueldo q me prometieron y decidi renunciar por conveniencia propia actualmente trabajo por cuenta propia a domicilio con conocidos
bad,Sears offers its leadership small increases in pay from the associate title while adding more than double the workload. Communication from the higher-ups is non-existent.
bad,Lots of driving. Lots of pressure to arrive at every call assigned for the day. Feeling insecure everyday. Horrible management. Co-workers were great.
bad,"It was a ok job. Very slow and drawn out. I really dreaded going into there because the environment was so depressing and gloomy. The pay was great though, so I guess it balanced itself out."
bad,Need help with day to day work don't know what going on untell you get there not good hard to go to a job like that can't plan your life out said of work stressful
bad,One of there best employees. They should put more care into there employees. H.R was there best quality in the company. Co workers made the job a little better.
bad,"Sears Holding Corporation continues to seek out ways to undercompensate their employees.    While they claim their culture is building and taking care of their members (customers)   they also continue to under pay and find more innovative ways to under compensate those of us they expect to uphold their vision.   in the auto center we never have parts supplies,   day in and day out we have no choice but to use non OEM recommended parts, and oil viscosities in vehicles, just to name a few issues."
bad,Management always pushed to sell credit cards rather than customer happiness and appreciation. Co-works kept to themselves and did not socialize much. Co-works would often push a customer off on you because they did not want to help them. Pay was based on commission in tools and lawn and garden department.
bad,Worked as a road technician with very little support in the area of parts and test equipment for the techs on the road. Management was unresponsive to the requests from the techs to help with this issue. Sears eventually shutdown the repair business.
bad,"Working environment wasn't great, a lot of my coworkers came into work so mad at something and I didn't even do anything"
bad,"I actually enjoyed my time as a automotive service writer. It was never the same thing, everyday was different. Well same job, different customers. This a job where the golden rule truly applies."
bad,Disorganized leadership with no strategic focus or clear idea how to be retail merchants. The business is run as separate BU's and as a result there are 10 different leaders doing ten different things and no communication. A big bus with no direction about to crash!
bad,"No much customers, Lack of management, Lack of hours, no raises, lack of recognition. There was barely any training when you first start. But meet some associate that are very nice. Wouldn't pick sears as a career option."
bad,Pay is either hourly or commission. Both are low. There may be times where you are the only person on the sales floor and sales are going on meaning a large volume of customers. This can happen often and is very stressful.
bad,"Sears does not offer pay merit increases. Poor advancement opportunities. Great co-workers, but high turn over. I have seen poor to amazing managers, but the company offers little to no advancement for employees."
bad,"management was horrible most of the time, they played favorites in giving hours. coworkers were great but were considered floaters seeing as they would most likely stay for a month before leaving, store was constantly hiring new people and those people quickly left, only a small few have stayed more than a yr. expected to work all jobs but the one you wee payed for including sitting in as a manager untrained and against company policies, over time often worked and never paid. free work or not i lived 7 minutes away never said no so hours were never my problem, they bounced me around in different positions which all i did well in."
bad,"There is not a lot of direction from the leadership of this company.  There are several key areas that Sears is lacking to stay a relevant competitor.  Most of all, a consistent message and direction from all of the senior level leaders."
bad,"Management will talk down to you and yell for not knowing how to do things you were never trained to do.  Some practices are  illogical and can almost be seen as busy work.  You will be expected to work hard while the favorites barely do a thing and hang out in the office with management.   Cover your butt at all times,  there's a lot of theft and they will surely throw you under the bus as if you had anything to do with it. "
bad,"Sears is a great store that I love to shop in and when I joined I loved it. But they have no training and don't give me enough time, the just want sears cards sold and they don't care about anything else. They are always mad if you don't get one and they always work me during school even though they know I have school."
bad,"My time at Sears was an okay experience, as I started I was not really trained, I looked at others and watch them to gain information on what to do. When I first started I was getting okay hours, but towards the end I was getting little to no hours and I believe it was because I was only part-time. A typical work day was either really stressful and busy, or really relaxing and slow. Everyday was the same as far as learning wise, meaning I never learned anything new. The management at Sears was okay. There are multiple managers, and everyday they are different people. They are very slow and I feel as if they do not communicate with one another. My co-workers were either really nice or extremely rude to me and customers, making it an uncomfortable work environment. The hardest part of the job was waiting for an MOD (manager on duty) to call you back and answer the customers question, I say this because they were very slow and made me and the customer wait. As for most enjoyable part of the job I would say it was making the customers happy."
bad,"A regular day at work is not hard, just arriving early in the morning. I had to learn how to use the system by asking my co-workers what to do. My manager did not train me whatsoever, just threw me into work. My co-workers are great, friendly, helpful, and hard-working. My job wasn't very hard, the only things is that its boring and the system can sometimes crash."
bad,some co workers and managers are friendly. other than that the management team is horrible. they only care about the store metrics. everything goes unnoticed. not a place you'd want to stay for long.
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. There is no way to keep up on all the metrics they want. You must hit every member for every metric every time, and even that won't keep them from berating you for whichever one you missed that month. Since there are so many metrics, there is no way to not be in trouble for something.  I worked at Sears for over 3 years. My customers loved me, I had quite a few that keep coming back and my sales were usually in the top two in the department, but I was struggling with lack of hours because some metric was low and they punish you with your schedule. "
bad,"If you are desperate for a job, go to Sears, because they are likely short handed due to yet ANOTHER person quitting/walking out on them. By far the most stressful job I've ever had. Terrible pay, and I hope you are great at putting people in debt by begging them to sign up for all the credit cards they have to offer. Hope you like getting yelled at for asking one too many times (or else your manager will be furious). It's just unrealistic goals they set, why be a part of a team that's going underwater and no one seems to care abut you? I'd take an extra week to find a different job. I'd honestly work fast food over there ever again."
bad,"The best part of Sears was the people you worked with. Met a lot of good people there, but Sears laid me off because I have a disability."
bad,"The manager did not train you on any important items.  He was in total control of the commissions.  He would just take away money with showing any proof, and when I put in the paperwork to fight it he had final say.  The work place became very harsh and I decided to leave."
bad,"Sears is a great company to work for if you want to gain experience and advance rather quickly. The systems are pretty dated which makes day to day operations a bit tasking, but doable. The future of the company is a bit uncertain, but I have enjoyed my time while working here."
bad,"Sears Holdings is focused on building the Shop Your Way member program, and integrated retail. Marketing is focused on delivering personalized offers, using 1st and 3rd party data. This is a smart approach, but it should be championed with strong brand building knowing that Sears brand perception is at an all time low."
bad,"A typical day was fast paced and time sensitive. They do give you some training but most comes from just doing the job daily. Some managers are great others, not so much. Other technicians are very nice and usually helpful. Hardest part of the job is selling protection agreements and managing your time. Best part was actually working on the machines, if that was all the job entailed, it would be a perfect job."
bad,"I enjoyed the job and had great satisfaction in my position . 3 other people were hired for this position in the last year. I was told I was doing a good job . Then the day after a big sale ,just after my first break was taken into an office and told I was no longer needed . I was escorted to my locker and to the door, I asked 3 times why . It took the manager of the store 3 weeks to call me and tell why I was let go. Reason was I was not aggressive enough with customers . Within two weeks my lead was fired and now they looking for new manager For the store . Management was terrible . The staff was great and wonderful to work with."
bad,"Atender a los clientes en piso de venta, haciendo las cotizaciones y el cierre de venta, dando asesoria en decoracion cuando asi lo solicitaban."
bad,"Overall the people in general were nice, only problem was is that it was very unorganized and hours being cut short. It wasn't really a positive environment and wasn't professional."
bad,"direction dois changer."
bad,"A typical day started with trying to find a system that would let me clock in. Certain days I could not clock in on any systems. Then the rest of the day was spent behind the jewelry counter making sales announcements, finishing paper work, cleaning, and occasionally helping customers. At least once a day a manager would come by and complain that there hasn't been enough announcements. (even if there were an announcement every half hour.) If you did have to take a lunch you had to take it specifically in your 5th hour, and good luck trying to get someone to cover. For the majority of shifts you were alone. Most of the other co workers (cashiers and etc.) were extremely rude to you and most of the jewelry team. As for the   other fine jewelry associates, they were mostly like dramatic high schoolers. The management was as atrocious as the co workers. You knew if the manager did not like you. For example I was needing an emergency procedure done and had only a week's notice. After telling two managers that I would be unable to work at all that weekend, due to recovery,  I was told that they would take care of it and not to worry. I returned that following Monday to hear from my store manager that I'm written up for a ""no call no show"". Before I left   I was told that I had 4 write ups, which I had only seen and signed 1. Sears by far is one of the worst companies to work for."
bad,Very unprofessional and unrealistic. Would expect way too much from a staff with not enough people. Managers would yell at associates in front of other associates. Would hardly ever help when we were understaffed with lots of work to be done.
bad,"poor management, does not care about employees"
bad,without a doubt the worst internal customer support and computer systems I have ever dealt with. They could fix a lot of the daily customer complaints if they updated their system.
bad,"Terrible. They want you to call people about things they never wanted. Home improvement? Yeah right. Whenever you got a lead, the person almost never picked up, you were always sent to voicemail, and when the person did decide to pick up, you were then yelled at and hung up on. These people used to complain about the company calling them 15-20 times a day every single day! Talk about harassment. Then you would be responsible for not getting an appointment made."
bad,"It is easy to tell that this company is going down quickly. The turnover is a high ratio,and the upper management is grasping for straws. They do not properly train, but expect you to know every facet of the job."
bad,Lack of associates for the amount of work planned. Outdated equipment and tools. A great challenge overall there's just not a balanced structure to be able succeed.
bad,I disliked highly working for sears. Management was ridiculous. Its a retail company but most of our management did not know how to use a register. Employees who has been there for 20 years NEVER received raises. Sears example of a raise is becoming full time. Working more and harder with the same pay as a part timer.
bad,The sporadic schedule and high demands of the job were not conducive to my work life balance with my children. I moved into the training department to help with the work life balance but things only got worse.
bad,Very slow.  The upper management was very bad.  The district manager was scared to come to the store but then said we were over reacting when we said we were scared to walk to our cars at night a lone across the dark parking lot.  Customer thought that they could talk to our staff anyway they wanted and that they could do anything they wanted including hitting staff members. While district manager said it was the staff members fault for not just letting a customer have whatever they wanted
bad,I started here during Christmas season and they start out really nice and you get tons of hours and as soon as it ends they all turn on you and become very immature co-workers and managers. The managers will cut your hours if you do something that makes them personally mad but has nothing to do with the work place.
bad,"Very weak management. Terrible work culture. It seems like no one cares. The tools for the job are inadequate."
bad,Working for Sears is an experience that will help build your professional charcter.The pay and hours leave a lot to be desired.
bad,"I worked on the sales floor, directly assisting customers with their consumer electronics purchases. This included televisions, surround sound systems, blu-ray players, digital cameras, video game systems, and cell phones as well as all of these products'  accessory items. "
bad,No benefits for part-time employees. No room for internal advancement. Work hours are flexible but pay really sucks if you are not on commission.
bad,"Sears has just about exhausted available ""re-inventions"" and is struggling to maintain market share. The direction is murky and the future is uncertain."
bad,"this job was unpleasant for me, my experience was horrid, however i did learning a lot about  retail operation, like cashiering, refunds, billing and stored credit."
bad,"I was required to get peoples email address as a quota, even if there was no customers. Everyone on staff was making them up. Was let go because I went from working 40 hours a week to 8, decided to get it covered by co-worker to vacation with family. I came back and was not on the schedule so called in and they told me I had to take it up with the supervisor."
bad,"The amount of hours you receive each week are centered around how many people you can get to sign up for a credit card. This means that if people do not want to apply for a credit card you will pay the price. While you are ringing customers up, management will periodically call down and badger you about how many credit applications you need to get signed by customers. The most enjoyable part about working at Sears would have to be your fellow cashiers and/or merchandising associates. They also have to deal with the torment from management regarding the credit applications."
bad,This company only cares about money. I've worked in retail for years and never had I experienced such poor communication.
bad,"Sears doesn't offer any room for growth or advancement. Although the photography itself was fun and exciting, the job does not offer anything for financial stability. There was never any talk of promotions or wage increases. To top it off the photography studio just shut down one day without any warning what so ever and left multiple people without jobs."
bad,Helped men with their measurements answering and transferred call to proper destination answer customers questions provide directions and assist with product choices and sales promotions
bad,Call center with dishonest approach to selling the product.  Customers were not helped if they had an issue with their product.  A typical work day involved meeting monetary deadlines hourly.  If you did not meet the deadline everyday you were instantly demoted.  The work conditions were unbearable.  The management treated each employee with disrespect.  What I learned from this job and workplace is not to stay in an environment that is unhealthy.
bad,"A typical workday is hard to describe. However I can say that after I actually went through proper training my issues were no longer occurring. However, management was still holding me accountable for things that I had no understanding of how to fix and until I was properly trained. So this assistant store manager position was not beneficial at all. I do like the company as a whole and most of the people are friendly (even if they go to extremes to have things known). The way it conducts business seems a little of kilter. This being said I know I am not perfect and made mistake I still held my tongue and went to the appropriate people first. Its amazing how you can be held accountable for so much even when they all knew you were not properly trained and even after the issues did not occur since then they would rather toss anyone aside the stick up for their people."
bad,"The turnover ratio is ridiculous. There is always people who quit or get fired and there is a valid reason for it. There is no room for growth , the management is so unprofessional. you feel like just a random number."
bad,"Corporate/Management constantly force credit and warranties as the driving force. I understand the importance of certain metrics in regards to profit, but their methods for trying to meet those metrics are unethical and deceiving for the consumer. "
bad,I am looking for a career that will give me the opportunity for advancement and security. I want to be in a position for merit wage increases along with opportunities to obtain performance compensation.
bad,"alot of work for 6 dollars an hour plus commission, sales,stock,customer service,answer phones,training,great co-workers,some managers did their job other half was there for nothing,hardest part of the job was to make sales goal when there isn't alot of traffic and your doing other duty's besides selling."
bad,"Management does not have a sense of work+life balance. Favoritism plays a role in your advancement. Everyday it seemed tense and unpleasant because of the uncertainty of tomorrow. Also, getting anything done in HR is a nightmare."
bad,"We were paid 7.25/hr. We were pressured to do more than the pay we were being paid. The managers were extremely lazy and when customers demanded to see them they presented poor customer service. The hardest part of working here was dealing with poor managers exemplifying poor customer service. The best part was getting a pay bonus for selling credit applications to customers. Besides the managers, my co-workers were like family."
bad,Not a lot of chances to advance in the company and they do not train their new associates well. Very unorganized work environment and management. Associates would have to lead themselves daily in order to take care of customers in a timely manner.
bad,"The managment is not good at all, and treats the employee awfully. The hourly pay employee is always with fear for the low hours a manager can bring you, if you don't do the things exactly like they want it."
bad,wasn't there to long they change to much and closed my part of department. I wasn't even on the floor for to long before they let go and transferred some to other departments.
bad,"I worked in the jewelry department which was very boring. My supervisor there who wasn't supposed to leave me alone for my first two weeks frequently took two hour lunch breaks. The schedule was out every Monday but management would change it and not tell the employees so you would be reprimanded for not showing up for a shift you didn't know you were scheduled for. Management told employees that they were to check the schedule every day for changes. Most of my coworkers were good people with the exception of a few who thought they were still in middle school and acted as such by gossiping and back stabbing. I ended up being terminated from there after I didn't show up for a shift that was added without my knowledge. Everyone else knew I was terminated before I did because the manager deemed it appropriate to gossip about it. This job taught me that if a place is always hiring, there's a reason."
bad,"The work was easy, especially since I've done it in other jobs. But management was horrible. Never know if you are going to get a break. People make up lies about other people an get them in trouble. Managers relax and pretty much play around. Definitely cant complain about too little hours. Don't bother asking for time off because no matter how badly you need it, unless someone died, you won't get it."
bad,"I am hard-working,outgoing, diligent, motivated, polite, reliable,and respectful."
bad,This is not a good job. The only thing that I liked about this job is that I was able to keep my job while I was away from college. You no raises to look forward to. Management is all on different pages. The new store manager is an arrogant snob. He is not a people person and do not care about his employees.
bad,"I worked at sears seasonally and only for about a month and a half. I liked the fact that I got a lot of hours, but I was there extensively. I would sometimes go in at 7am and wont leave until about 11pm. My manager never really seemed to care and she was often very one-sided about issues that I bring to her about different situations. The job was very repetitive."
bad,Disorganized stressful and major network issues were just some of the challenges beside poor management at the Standards of Excellence division of Sears Holdings.
bad,"Too much pressure, management is lost on Customer Service."
bad,"salary is a joke, poor management, theres no career advancement"
bad,"After 25 years, due to SR Leadership Changes, I would not want to represent this company as a site General Manager"
bad,Great company to work at in order to learn retail and financial skills. The last 2 years of my time at Sears were spent on projects and cost cutting initiatives which ultimately prepared me for roles where profit needs to be optimized.
bad,"I work the cash office at sears and I hate it there. I've only been there a few months and already want to quit. The biggest problem there, to start with, are the managers. "
bad,"short lunches, long hours, rude customers, friendly workplace/atmosphere"
bad,"Bad management and no way to get a raise or move up.  Nice people to work with, though"
bad,"This job was not worth the stress. The pay rate was great but was not worth the way you got treated not only over the phone, but by management. You would get in trouble for putting yourself in personal to go use the restroom. You could have the customer on hold more than 2 minutes. And the manager were never around to help you when you needed it. They didn't want to take phone calls or give advice on what you should do with a certain customer.I only liked the pay rate and that i could get overtime when and how much i wanted.. To much gossip and high school like people there. NOT WORTH IT"
bad,"A typical day at work involves standing around for hours as there is very little foot traffic in the store and cleaning, maintaining your department. Management makes this job a nightmare. Micromanagement is a part of every day. If one manager decides they don't like you, every one of them will work together to make your days difficult.  Pay is good, no chance of advancement, and financially unstable company  make this place NOT somewhere you want to be."
bad,"- Cashiering"
bad,I would rate this job a 2-3. Good for someone that like commission jobs.
bad,"When I First started as a Merchandiser There was a good amount of hours but after 4 months of working there my hours dropped first to 10 hours a week then down to one 4 h shift a week. and it wasn't just the hours that where bad the Managers Had no idea how to manage there staff all they would do is yell at you until your ears bleed and then tell you to do something you weren't certified to do. "
bad,This was a part time job for me after I left my Substitute Teaching daytime job.
bad,"Overall, the company will not meet their goals as long as they keep on expecting the impossible out of everyone while failing to give us the adequate resources need to run and maintain a store."
bad,"Pull freight to the floor. Delegate tasks to associates. Do schedules. Check call out line. Follow up. Price changes."
bad,great customer service but they might want to pay their employes better and management needs to learn how to treat their employees with respect
bad,Management was ridiculous. They played favorites and made you work after the store closed even though they evaluated you based on sales per hour. Two extra hours with no Customers.
bad,"Starting the day on time and finishing on time which was very rare,"
bad,General Manager in Gretna is a good leader but his support staff lacks ability
bad,Sears co-workers (outside of sales) were amazing.  The floor managers were quick to teach you the ropes.  The problem is when you get promoted to sales your rate of pay changes constantly.  They will yank your commission up to 90 days after a sale. The head management promotes commission theft. Makes it a hostile situation.
bad,"You live or die by this months sales metric."
bad,While the people I work with are fantastic... The company is not proactive. The management team does not value their employees
bad,"It's a job...lots of drama here. Deal with a lot of moody people and don't get paid enough for the job you do. All they care about is how many people use a sears master card, not how much sales you made."
bad,"This place was the reason I returned to school and finished my Bachelors degree. I'm not the type of person to ask people at every single transaction if they'd like to open a Sears credit card, so my hours kept getting cut."
bad,"Not much to say about Sears. They're very well known, however managed poorly. Management does not help improve their current associates. Pay is just as poor. Turnover rate is pretty high as well"
bad,The culture at this company is no existent. It is okay for some looking for a summer job or in high school but pay versus experience is not there.
bad,"On a typical day I was required to enroll customers into the rewards program and assist them with applying for credit cards. My co-workers and I developed team unity during the absence of supervisors. I enjoyed building a rapport with each customer."
bad,"I was a cashier but had many job assignments and responsibilities."
bad,"Worked as cheetah. Basically you process online orders. first you find them and then process them for shipment. "
bad,"My shift would start at 6am, I would head to the warehouse, received inbound merchandise, verify all product information, transfer the product in designated areas, research product without information, move and stage all product into proper areas, would repeat the same process all day until 2pm. shipped out customer's product out, clean warehouse, called customers, would contact other stores, then I would head to the HR department, attend weekly HR/production meetings, review reports, work on the worker compensation files open, manage safety web updating information, would make reports of any incident with employee's at the job, track attendance, communicate any changes to management, address employee's issue, would meet with manager, would go over any issues encounter at the warehouse or HR related topics that needed addressing, etc."
bad,a typical day stocking because it was a weekend store so my sales were low an it was the only way to keep busy. my co-workers were nice people
bad,"Lots of hours for a fast-paced minimum wage position which hours changed constantly and very inconvenient due to dismissal time, distance from home, lack of imput from managers, etc."
bad,"and every few months there is a new CEO with a new plan and new direction, and then a few months later you re-re learn what HIS replacement thinks can be done."
bad,Underpaid and overworked.  No job security for any employee.
bad,"It was nice place.  I was a Photoghapher there.Its been closed. Sorry"
bad,"Sears is not a good place to work if you want to advance your career, they no longer give merit raises, if you want to make money at Sears you must sell, it's all commission based wages, the management team is top heavy and unwilling to listen to employee issues and concerns, they treat there customers poorly, the benefits are average, no one in management is willing to make a decision for fear of repercussions, if you are not a TOP performer you are written up then if you don't improve your gone, and by TOP performer I mean sales and up sales."
bad,Not friendly supervisor and no effort to encourage people to work there hardest. The hardest part of the the job was that there was no ventilation in the store and both workers and customers were forced to be in very hot and stuffy conditions.
bad,"After working there for three months, the company's verbal communication and discrimination was not the place for me to be. They ended up being sued by several of its field managers and since I wanted no part of that litigation, I resigned."
bad,"Worked for 22 years and worked my way up through the company.  Experiencing the culture and every possible job in the store.  Once a manager it was the most enjoyable time at Sears Holdings 11 years ago. Training and having the pride of the store I was in.  Working with many associates and teaching them great customer service. Unfortunately when the company started to struggle expectations for managers became harsh, I was a dedicated manager who worked 6 days and worked long days with no compensation ever.  No raises in years"
bad,"Sears used to be a good place to work for. Unfortunately, the manager that I had to deal with was not so nice. She didn't treat me that well. The other co workers that worked in my department were really nice. I got a long really well with them and we worked great as a team. The hardest part of my job was just knowing I had to go into work and wondering if I was going to get in trouble for something I didn't do."
bad,testing all the appliances to make sure they working in order.also training other workers on what to look for when testing.
bad,"This particular store had some major issues with its management team. They did not treat employees like they were part of the team, took extra long time when being called to assist customers, and had too many personal favorites. This team also did not like new employees coming in with more experience or knowledge than they did. As a former employee with their sister company, I would have to say they are nothing like Kmart. There is little room for advancement and employment is 'conditional'."
bad,"poor management, but maybe next month the manager will be better because they don't last long. It is a good place to start in order to gain experience in the automotive shop."
bad,"My experience working for Sears was a god one at first. You can learn a lot about yourself and your own capabilities because you are often thrown to the wolves on this job as the training, or the lack thereof, is not up to par. Each day you are faced with understaffed, incompetent shifts. If you are a self starter, you will do great. If you have thick skin and do not mind being talked down to by managers, you will be a golden child. The hardest part of the job is not having templates to perform given tasks and dealing with stressed, rude managers. There are only a handful of decent supervisors here. The most enjoyable part of the job are helping customers and giving them a great experience. The other enjoyable experience is clocking out at the end of your shift."
bad,It seemed that if you weren't part of management or HR that you were looked down upon. Treated associates like little kids.
bad,NO home life work balance                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I worked here so that I could be a full time student. It served its purpose for a while. But at the end of the day I had to let it go so I could continue my education and graduate.
bad,SHC is a cultural mess.  The environment is counter-productive and the focus is internally focused versus looking outward at what competition is doing. There is a lot of duplicated work done and the systems are not up-to-date.
bad,"Fun to work with co workers."
bad,"Not a stable and secured place of employment. No raises, the job position kept changing. Very high turn over rate."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me asking what needed to be done as no one ever took the time to show me.  "
bad,"The most poorly run store I have ever seen. In the 8 months or so I was there, I had 4 different Store Managers. You never knew what to expect ANY day you were going to work. There computer systems were from the 70's, there truck delivery system was awful. There was no structure from any of the assistant managers to dept. managers."
bad,"Typical day- very slow not many customers in my department so i would often go to other departments to try and help"
bad,"The management does their best to avoid any work at all and shrugs off any responsibility or accountability for tasks they should undertake. Management is also antagonistic towards customers, corporate values are a joke at Sears. Employees are underpaid for the work they have to do and asked to perform tasks that are not their responsibility. Management is underworked and overpaid I imagine. Probably the worst managed place I have ever worked in my life. I am 32 years old and spent 10 years in the military, I am no stranger to hard work. There is little respect between employees from different departments, team work between departments is non-existent. Jobs are secure because they only want warm bodies due to the low pay, they do not let people go for bad performance. Disgusted almost daily when I arrived at work. A typical day at work would be walking into a mess because no one cared about their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people that work there are great people, probably about 50% of them. Also going home was wonderful. Getting a great workout for 8 hours a day was also awesome and I will miss that. The hardest part of the job is not getting disgusted with another employee or manager and throwing them in a trash can. The store is also closing at a time TBD and customers have questions and we have no answers. Customers also pay for things and management gets upset when they attempt to get what they pay for. Helping out a customer is also a great feeling. I have had several tell me how good a job I have done and one that mentioned writing a thank you"
bad,"selling jewelry, fixing jewelry, meeting new people, co-workers are great and friendly"
bad,"-Small team with a lot of opportunity to learn"
bad,"I worked in a Sears Warehouse. There, we went through clothes to be hung, prices, packed and shipped to different Sears Outlets."
bad,Awful place to work with management that didn't know it's butt from it's face.
bad,"Its where your grandfather used to shop which is why you will not see young people going there."
bad,If you work hard you can accomplish your goals. Hard workers and slackers are wherever you go. I enjoy the different areas and levels of multitasking
bad,did not like always what you to work will not give u time for family
bad,really bad company to work have not got a raise in 5 years.. no overtime .....you will be lucky to get 30 hours a week
bad,"This job pays relatively well, but you don't want to make any type of career out of it!!!"
bad,The company does not train you for what you are required to do . The company is not employee focused 
bad,"Associates expected to take on more work without any prospect of pay or position advancement. "
bad,"A typical work day is focused on chasing the metric of the week, it seems that each week management shifts a given metric to the highest priority at the expense of others. Moral is typically low and turn over is high. As a manager, I have little time to train or motivate due to the high level of mishaps created by our logistics units. My time is spent putting out fires or investigating problems.   "
bad,"I work hard everyday , with no benefits.  I also work for minimum wage. I need something that pays better."
bad,it is a good place to work if you are in school but for a career forget about it.
bad,"Management broke policies all the time but when an associate tries to get upper management help...the associate loses, 12 year position?!?...Then the company fights unemployment.....did not pay out rewards previously won...Sears is Unethical..... Contradict there own rules & procedures...No Raises in over 3 yrs,No incentives, No bonus or recognition.. "
bad,Sears is a company that manages by fear of being fired. They imply by threating that you will lose your job or have your hours cut because you didn't sell the protection agreement or get a credit application.
bad,"Small family run print shop. "
bad,Fast pace work environment. Management tends to not train employees well. 
bad,"Au début j'ai découvert des muscles que je ne connaissais pas."
bad,Review and listen to calls for a team of 15 inbound call associates
bad,Sears barely gives you any hours and there are not many benefits. The pay for a cashier is $7.25 and no more than that no matter how long you work there.
bad,Work was slow. company not orginazed. self owend. co workers are wonderful. managment was hard to comunicate with.
bad,"Pushing high interest credit cards for 2 dollars each application is not worth the guilt of ruining somebody's credit. Coworkers are extremely friendly but management flexes rules for high performers (i.e. allowing longer breaks, dress code violations, etc.). Management has unrealistic goals and if the goals are not met, you can expect an extreme cut in hours. Will be scheduled to close at 9:30 pm then come back the next day at 9:30 am to open."
bad,Being at Sears made me feel like I was forced to be someone I wasn't. I had to ask everybody if they had a Sears Credit Card and if not to try to sign them up for one. To me that's ridiculous! That's almost inhumane. To the Sears company you are just a money maker and you are disposable.
bad,"Grunt work for grunt pay. Commission based so co-workers are cut throat. Burlington store is the busiest though, so they over hire."
bad,"At that time of employment, it was during the depression, a lack of business per hour was depressing. we worked on salary vs commision. base salary was $6.00 per hour,but if there were no customers, no commision."
bad,"Sears, is a company who is trying to redefine what they are, due to the age and lack of vision it as become lost. Trying to enter the modern age of technology by implementing IPAD POS SYSTEM that is still tied to 20 year old processes and wondering why it does not work."
bad,"The first thing to make note of, is that very little of my beef with Sears is a direct result of my store's managers. They are all doing their best and they all have bosses too, so they need to appease the beast as much as anybody else."
bad,"the customers are the best thing about this job, this would be a great job to have for someone that's needing only part time, this is not a company that I can see my self growing with"
bad,Lack of leadership.
bad,This place was one of the worst that I worked for due to the fact that it was in a run down mall so there was really never anyone shopping so there was never much to do and always felt like it took forever for all the shifts to pass also the managers were not helpful and were never really there
bad,I received a placement with them after applying and felt that they didn't focus or care about their employees. The interviewing process was lenghly and then you were basically idled to make so many mistakes without any training or security there with people you hardly knew.
bad,"Everywhere has problems, but this employer has quite a few that are hard to overlook."
bad,always changing. No appreciation for associates. No accountability for management.
bad,Sears was a great place to work. however the poor management left employees feeling stressed! coworkers were awesome!
bad,"Poor communications, lack of scheduling, poor management communications and work environment."
bad,"job was to sell part to customer that call in for the parts for lawnmower, ref and freezer, washer and dryer"
bad,"Great for Part time work,but very stressful.The hardest part of the job is the crazy customers and lazy employees.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid."
bad,management didnt treat people well the breaks are too short and even if your new no one wants to take the time to train you for the job they just wait for you to do something wrong
bad,"To many managers for example 12 associates in a department, 4 team managers, 1 assisstant manager, 1 senior manager, and 1 gm."
bad,Assit customers in finding shoes and straighten shoes. Order shoes on-line for customers when requested.
bad,"I worked there briefly but during that time the culture of the company was not what I was used to. Maybe it's changed now, but it wasnt a friendly or productive environment at the time."
bad,"I worked at sears for nearly 2 years, running the cash registers, and counting the cash drawers for opening/closing times. It was not a challenging job, and found no room for growth."
bad,"I worked there for four years, never missed a day, was never late, was never promoted, and I never made more than minimum wage. We were forced to sign an agreement from talking about our jobs online. We were also forced into an arbitration agreement so that we couldn't sue in open court."
bad,"Normally slow, so I appreciated when there was a customer. I wasn't getting many hours so I felt like it wasn't worth it only have 4 hours or less a week."
bad,Not any room for promotions or advances. Seems to be mostly in store advances if you know the right people.
bad,"It is difficult to get excited about working at Sears Holdings / Kmart. Accomplishments are never acknowledged, expectations and goals are set to ridiculous standards, and priorities are poorly placed. The infrastructure of our inventory is an utter mess and shipments fail to capitalize on popular products, leading to a surplus of undesired merchandise. The only enjoyable aspect of work is the occassional customer to interact with and the coworkers that bear the suffering with you. Corporate has mind-boggling expectations of what stores are capable of, but a store is only has efficient and productive as management and the customers allow the employees to be. Constantly understaffed and highly underappreciated."
bad,Very uncaring company for the employee.Working hard is not appreciated.
bad,I would unload truck from 7 am until trucks were done unloding preparer merchandise to be distributed on sales floor
bad,"The typical day for an MCA at Sears is about helping customers find items, keeping the clothes neatly in-line, and stocking new clothes out onto the floor. The customer interactions are usually fun and pleasant, so it can be nice to work here!"
bad,This place has the worst management team in Aurora Colorado. I'll never work them again.
bad,Sears was awsome when I first started. I had the best store manager and the best co-workers. I made several friends that I still keep in contact with. But when managment changed it went down hill. Employees started to be treated like dirt. We would get wrote up for everything including not smileing! But we werent smiling because we were being treated badly. And because we were being treated so poorly our attitudes began to change. And when our attitudes began to change customers took notice. Now my store is closed!
bad,"The only people that appreciate you, are the customers. The raises were minimal, an extra .10 cents an hour in appreciation to all your hard work, really? Over expanding work area to 100 mile radius and increasing workload to 12 service calls a day, then complain when your stats are not made, not 1 technician was able to make thier stats. I spent 12 years there because of my customers and the overall enjoyment of working with my hands."
bad,"Working in the Appliance Department at Sears requires several different competencies to be able to successful meet sales goals and satisfy customers. While earning full commission, I am required to assist customers in selecting their new appliances, generate leads, follow up with recent purchases and keep our sales floor presentable."
bad,"I worked for Sears in the large appliance department that is commission only wages. This means during certain periods your earnings were very good and other days you made nothing. You could sell $30, 000.00 in a day and if you did not sell enough Protection Agreements with those sales your hours were cut. Management was concerned with your ability to sell Protection Agreements and keep the portion of the department assigned to you clean. Management changed your schedule every week to where you did not know when to plan appointments. Co-workers in commission sales see each other as competitors and a few of us worked good as a team. The hardest part of the job was being called into the managers office and yelled at for not selling enough Protection Agreements. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a large sale with Protection Agreements."
bad,One of the worst jobs I have ever had. The managers had become a new aristocracy in the building. I was injured at work and was told despite my injury to work harder and faster. They would schedule me to work until 11 at night and then have me return to work at 5 AM. I was given a written warning about missing work after I wittnessed the death of a child no more than 20 feet in front of me
bad,"While the HQ offices were relatively incredible with everything from a dry cleaner to a bank to 7 different types of world cuisine for lunch, the company atmosphere and culture was pretty bad. Company performance was in the toilet and it was an all out panic on how to react and the result was throwing good money after bad. Management left a lot to be desired here."
bad,"I have read and understood a lot of the coorporation's goals for the company. I can see that they somehow do try to focus on the customers. However, working in the store I work with is different. The management there is careless, some are lazy, and I find it difficult to look up to anyone there, as the good managers have either quit, or transferred. I just wish that the management there cared more about the customers and the other employees. Not all Sears are like this though."
bad,Never communicated with employees and always working money wasn't very good and I was never home with my family.
bad,"Good job for someone in high school, living at home with parents or basically have no or little amount of bills. Retired folks maybe or someone in transition from bad times."
bad,"They treat you like a number. The upper management has never said ""Hi"" or anything else when they come in. They lie to people to get them to stay. I have never seen a company so poorly ran. Everybody is in it for themselves."
bad,"This Sear store that i work for, have their favorites.  They have as you would say a Circle of Friends.  They hired someone that has been there more than a few years and know cut mines and the other associate hours. It was like a slap in the face. We w ere not informed before and got our hours cut i got 6hrs this wk and the other associate had 0. Next wk i have two days.  He has 0 hrs."
bad,"Fue una de las peores experiencias laborales que he tenido, la cultura laboral es muy pesada y la competitividad se resume a la supervivencia del más abusivo, lo peor es que no hay un control por parte de los jefes de departamento para evitar eso."
bad,"pagan mu poco, y las horas extras no se pagan monetaria mente se pagan con tiempo osea si me quedo 2 horas extras un día, el día que yo quiera salgo 2 horas antes."
bad,"chismes de pasillo, poco crecimieto laboral y profesional."
bad,"Upper management played favorites, union fees were deducted from your low wages and you had to work ridiculous hours."
bad,Sears used to stand for a lot more then it has in recent years. Poor business practices followed by poor treatment of employees. Sears used to be about customer service and people. That slowly diminished at the turn of the century. That is when the slow demise of the company began.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job as far as products and especially customer service, as I love to help people. There is a lot to learn about appliances. Unfortunately, my paychecks were often miscalculated and it was a losing battle to get them corrected."
bad,"I applied for the cashier/apparel position and it was easy. I finally got a call back and they told me to fill out some things online and then told me to come into the store a certain date. Interview was easy and I got the job. They told me to fill out more things online and then to come into orientation a certain date. I came in and management was just lazy. The manager forgot about our orientation and we weren’t even trained at all not even about the policies/ rules. They just told me and my other friend to fold and organize clothes for 4 hours and they did not even teach us about the registers. They just left us there to do that only. Afterwards they told me to come back for my actual first day the next week. I did so and I had to ask my co worker what to do, they trained me instead and NOT EVEN THE MANAGERS DID THAT. I was only given a little packet about the emergency drills and codes for the store and a paper on how to talk with customers. All managers except one was pretty nice, the other managers were lazy, rude, and so unfair. I asked to change my che dile because I had something personal coming up, I never gave an attitude. The manager just gets mad and says, “I HAVE TO GO EAT NOW”. With such a bratty tone, she acts so rude towards everyone. I did what I was suppose to and after all that lazy management. I was left there to learn on my own the first 2 weeks. I was left to learn alone, I asked the managers if I could be taught  everything, they just ignored my simple question and put me back to folding clothes only. After some time, they get immediately mad for me using"
bad,A lot of customers at Sears feel like they are entitled to whatever they want. They switch price tags and when you tell them this is priced wrong then they demand to speak to a manager. Or really anything mildly inconvenient for them they want to speak to a manager. Unfortunately management is really slow to come over to resolve any issues.
bad,"At first, management was on top of everyday activities. Schedules were made in  a timely manner. Communication was very important in the workplace. However, after a few years it stopped being organized. Management slowly stopped being in control of operations. Future tasks for the week stopped being communicated to the workers. Overall, it became a poor work environment."
bad,"Working here was fun for a bit but the management is horrible (only 2 where actually good) , they really don’t know what they are doing they play favoritism way too much, and makes the whole environment toxic, as well as giving us way to many task for one position and most of those are difficult to achieve with no resources or help-available,the system for merchandise Pick up and Reciving is broken and the company doesn’t do anything to fix it, one manager is extremely rude and full of herself that thinks that the world revolves around her. This company or at least my store shows the symptoms of what the whole company is going trough starting from the top bad management all the way to every store management, and really shows why this company is struggling to stay afloat and is failing to do so."
bad,"I was a cashier at Sears being the first person there you take the bags for change count all of them, sign them out, grab the schedule and the goal cards for credit that day and walk to the cashier station and start counting registers. Sears has no customer service desk. So cashiers process all returns, payments, customer issues and of course ringing people out"
bad,Bad Management and No Benefits at all. No Employee Discount. Hard to reach managers. Pushes and Asks for way too much of one another. Poor overall experience.
bad,just something to keep a few dollars in your pocket while pursuing something greater. They do offer good balance for those who are in school or have a second job
bad,"For the position I had, I was responsable for maintaining, stocking, and assisting costomers in every department of the store except Tools and for helping to man the register when we got busy. The store was huge and I was often the only one of my position on any given day. I often had no set task from the management and had to hunt down my managers to figure out what they wanted me to focas on doing that day. Also, I have a disibility that makes standing in one place or walking for a long time verry difficult and no mater how much I talked to the management about it they never did anything to help (they could get away with it because Im not acutualy a ""registered"" disabled) and I was forced to walk the equivelent of several miles a day. I would often come home crying because I was in so much pain. I dindt leave the job because I didnt have andy better options at the time. Eventualy they fired me because I was aparently 1-2 minets late for work one to many times. I lived more than 45 min away mind you and the clock in station wasnt exsactly next to the employ entrance. Not to mention the fact that I was also attending my college classes and the amout of pain this job caused me to suffer made it dificult to getup in the mornings (they often had me closing one night and opening the next morning). The sears where I worked has closed since then so I cant speak for other stores, but I would not recomend this job to anyone for the reasons I listed above and for various other reasons I did not include."
bad,"Sears has been a failing company for a long time now and, if there are any still open near you that you are considering applying for, I have one word: don't. The culture in America no longer wants big box department stores such as Sears. At the very least, not ones that are woefully outdated and out of touch such as Sears. The Sears holding overview is  ""to be a leading integrated retailer focused on seamlessly connecting the digital and physical shopping experiences to serve our members - wherever, whenever and however they want to shop"". In my experience, their digital integration methods failed at every turn, either not providing the resources necessary to their employees or customers, or failing to do so in a manner that did not feel convoluted. Working as a commissioned sales person as well put a lot of pressure on their employees, especially when the sales have been in decline for years. Wages and commission rates were non-competitive, and business is in decline, if not outright finished. Let Sears die, do not apply to work for them."
bad,"Promised full time hours with benefits in interview for assistant manager in the jewelry department.  I took the job. Never got the hours they promised or benefits  and  started out with 35 hours and within a month they dropped it to 28 hours. I was hourly/commissioned based. I was given hourly minimum wage as a base plus commission based on sales. I was the TOP sales producer in my department. Selling 10,000-15,000 in a very slow store or more a week and only 2 times made over my minimum wage. They changed the commission structure on us twice so we ended up only getting pennies on the dollar amount sold. I was there for a year and a half and they dropped my hours to 8-10 hours a week due to budget cuts. I quit because it cost me more to drive back and forth to work than I got paid. Sad because I really liked my job. I left on good terms but would NEVER recommend working for an unstable company like sears."
bad,I have nothing more to add to my review that have not already covered in the star rating portion of this assessment. I'm not happy at this place of employment.
bad,The receiving job entailed many hours of moving freight and stocking shelf's. The job required limited job training. Some of the computer systems required a bit of learning to function properly.
bad,"Very stressful, metrics were stressed every day keeping track of 25 metrics with goals changing regularly.  Management was always on edge and was changed frequently."
bad,Very Poor Management - Very Poor Compensation - Employees Treated With Little Respect - Long Hours Verses Compensation - Rules By Intimidation - No Future With Company
bad,Really was upset by the way corporate treated the stores. Sears need to worry more about advertising the sales for members. Never work on commission here.
bad,"The job was a good one to learn and as a starting one, It gave me time to go to school and to pay some of the expenses I had. But as for full-time work, it wasn't available.."
bad,Not that good as service is limited to only 3 employees as sears was in the verge of liquidation  at the time.Manager was carelessly busy sustaining herself only.
bad,I was a part time employee and  there were only two employees (myself and my manager) that worked there besides the doctor. It is an okay place to work if you don't mind having a lot of down time on your hands.
bad,this is the must poor management company these guys just been seated at the office pushing you to do sales and at the same time perform your job the sales are just for they own benefit all the commission goes to them
bad,"I did learn a lot about work ethic and accountability from my direct manager, however in my opinion the overall experience wasn't the best.  I would never state any specific details about an employer but I will say that there was serious room for improvement.  My direct manager was an amazing person who I now consider a mentor.  He helped me grow as an employee and a person."
bad,"With my time spent at SEARS, My work experience was good learned many more things but company lacked to give us information of monthly productivity. Pay was fair but they had no contentious pay raises."
bad,Can be very good place to work if there was a better ownership I was able to perform well in all sales top salesman every year for the six years I have been there.
bad,The company has been in a downward spiral.  Many talented and dedicated people are giving their all to survive.  Stores and associates  have not had the capital investment .
bad,"Poor management, lack of sensibility, over paced, no benefits, no raise, the work environment or conditions where not the best. A typical day at work was stressing due to poor management and leadership."
bad,"Like working for sears, The only thing I didnt like was that it was require that we push the customer to apply for a sears credit card. And if you didnt meet a quota at the end of month on credit cards, you would lose your job."
bad,"I loved my team at Sears; however, the overall company management was not conducive to company survival. We weren't allowed enough hours/week to schedule adequate coverage for any of the departments.  Jobs were constantly cut, leaving too few people to keep the customers happy:  messy store, long lines, no one available to help. Loss Prevention was cut from most stores, resulting in an insane increase in shoplifters. Very stressful.  I never would have stayed if I didn't enjoy my co-workers so much."
bad,The highest prices in the industry for home sales makes it hard to compete with the other big box stores. However well installations go thee cost is double anyone else which makes it easy to get contracts.
bad,"The company was bought out by a hedge fund looking to capitalize on its extentive real estate holdings with no regards to running a proper retail culture and direction. Management only listens to what they want to hear, and once they do something that's suggestions, years have gone by and competition has overtaken them and that is why they had to file for bankruptcy."
bad,"It's kind of hard to work with them regarding hours, they expect your schedule just to be open and not busy like you don't have a life. I expected so much more this was my first consistent job so I was excited so share good and bad experiences with this job. I'm happy that I learned so much working there. Other than that I'm just glad I can take my information i learned to other jobs."
bad,Sucks I really do not like this job and the direction is going in from the CEO to the management they are in it for the company not necessarily for the employees
bad,It’s all bad never work there. I wouldn’t that’s why i left. If you can stay away . Don’t even know how long they’ll be open they filed for bankruptcy.
bad,Most of mid management is very good to work with but due to the questionable longevity it is highly stressful. You don't know if you will have a job the next week or not.
bad,"Sears was a stressful place to work, mostly had to relay on self, management took vacation leave a lot and hours given was poorly. worked for minimum wage and was never offered a raise in my department."
bad,"Bad pay, incompetent management, management made us do things not in our job title/ we were not trained to do, no room for advancement ever, and did not get a single pay raise in the 4 years i worked for them. The only good part about working there were that my fellow coworkers were understanding and helpful."
bad,"my time i sears was very good it was my first job in united states so i had to get experience from them as a receving associate, my task was to unload truck, merchandise pick up, etc"
bad,"Different upper divisions of the company seem to lack communication with each other, resulting in store level personnel being given conflicting instructions about how to handle/prioritize daily tasks. I enjoy working with customers, but declining foot traffic means I get to do my consultative job less and less. Work culture is stressed and fearful with so many locations closing down; store level management is under a lot of stress from rapidly changing expectations from executives, and the particular location I work at features managers more interested in gossip than assisting with urgent customer issues."
bad,"I started Sears in 1996-1997,  as a Cashier/Customer Service. We work for commission, which was hard to do but I did the best I can do, I did get along with others, friendly."
bad,I think the company has great potential but obviously the business inst doing too well- all I hear about anymore is more Sears shutting down. It was very inconvenient how quickly ours was closed- didn't give us very much time to look for a different job. Our supervisors and managers knew it was closing down before the liquidation lady came and didn't let us know for their own benefit.
bad,"At the time I was working, I was in school and though the pay was nice; it definitely was not worth it. I'd rather scrub floors with a tooth brush. And every single call was horrible and could last anywhere between 2 minutes to an hour. Despite the phrase ""they're only upset with you because you're the voice of the company"", I dreaded it. Never again."
bad,Boring place to work because you there aren't a lot of customers. when they have sales it gets crowded and you have to manage with limited co-workers.
bad,What I learned from Sears is basically that the management is not where it should be. Also they do not give you the tools to efficiently help your customer.
bad,The typical requirement at Sears was to basically show up and be in your department but performance standards were non-existent. If you could show up and just stay in your department whether you helped the customer or not you were considered to be doing a good job.
bad,awesome sales job a real money making machine selling and renewing warranties for the hours you work to the money you make is great. some managers are great.
bad,The hardest part about this job was trying to sell the credit cards provided through Sears while completing a transaction. There was no training on how to sell the credit cards therefore I could not perform to their expectations. I only thing enjoyable about this job was being in a clothing store.
bad,This was a cashier position that I intended to have for some extra money while I was in college and 24ish hours week was just perfect for me. The management was friendly and mostly the customers were as-well. I noticed some fundamental changes coming down the line from the higher ups and I could see the writing on the wall. SEARS is going away. I never intended this to be a permanent solution for myself so I easily found employment elsewhere. If you see a job posting for sears I would be very cautious. I can't imagine that the job will be very long lasting.
bad,"I worked in the optical department so I did not directly report to Sears management, I worked for Luxottica.  The hours are long and you often spent the days alone as labor budgets were completely unrealistic.  Unless I had no other options I would not return to work for this company."
bad,"Uncomfortable working environment. Never know how many hours your going to be given for the week. The merchandise is never where it should be. Under paid compared to the amount of work you will be doing. Forced to deal with things against your will. Hours usually cut. When I decided to resign from my position, it was due to a decrease in my hours. My final week, I was scheduled for ONE day, which was the busiest day of the week, Saturday. Even full time associates were under valued, and given less than 30 hours a week. 30 minute unpaid lunch breaks. Management changes very frequently. Typically under-average when it comes to a clean environment. Harsh labor honestly when you think about you overall retail competitors this company goes against."
bad,After working 10 years I was still making minimum wage and all my responsibilities went up. The people I worked with were like family even tho a lot of the staff changed over the years
bad,"Land's end clothing sales."
bad,Struggling company. Unhealthy work atmosphere. A lot of conflict and divisiveness. Always changing - reactive. Teams worked in silos. Always working about your job and if the company was doing under.
bad,"Was a great place to work, but now is so far into decline that I'm not sure its savable.  The leadership does not want to spend money on advertising but still expects to compete.  There is a constant frantic energy, people work evenings and weekends and still can't make progress because there is too much bureaucracy.  Sr level leaders compete instead of collaborate."
bad,"Everything was falling apart. People quit faster than they could hire. Minimum wage. Didn't schedule enough staff. Equipment (registers, zebras, phones, etc.) never worked right. Overworked the few good employees they had. Corporate expected a lot of things (for example, endcaps) but never provided necessary materials for it. Never had merchandise, half of our aisles had tags for items we didn't sell any more, or never sold."
bad,"In the experience I had while working at Sears, not much really went well for me, I'd say. The management was childish and employees were favored. I was not properly trained, but I'm gracious that I learn quickly. Immediately after finishing online training I was ringing up customers after being showed the process once. I quit after a shift lead told me I should cover up my legs because ""my body should be saved for my husband""."
bad,"The management don't really care and would not give hrs at at all, only to it's top employees. It's really slow and don't really give any big tasks and it's really mundane."
bad,El tiempo en el que laboras es mucho y no hay ventas además de que te piden que cubras tiempo extra y no los pagan
bad,"Pay wasn't great, the only thing that kept me working there was the availability of hours, the hardlines managers were awesome but some of the leads to have passed"
bad,"It is evident in the culture within the company that Sears is destined to fold. There are a lot of good opportunities to learn the retail side of the business and potential for advancement, but also equal or more opportunity to be laid off or have your job redefined or demoted due to cost cuts."
bad,"Work was fine,new my job,did the work also helped other departments.Company  started to cut benefits and froze wages no raises last ten years. Morale of personal is low."
bad,Not a good place to work. Ive been here for several years and I have been totally taken for granted. I'm currently looking for a better job. I would not recommend this place to anyone
bad,"Sears is the worst place to work. The management team did not care about the staff. the management team push the credit card application, there was no."
bad,Revolving leaders and staff where no one can succeed with the constant change and uncertainty of the financial state of Company. Culture is easy going but no accountability or support to train employees to succeed in their jobs.
bad,CPI Corp is no longer with Sears.  I wouldn't recommend to work for Sears at this location.  Most of the people were unpleasant when they came here. I may recommend a friend to work at a different Sears.
bad,"A typical day at work usually was very busy for me, which was good. I learned a lot about different areas of the store, and when I started the position I had a real good teacher that taught me a lot because he was very patient with new employees."
bad,Working at the Sears at Kings Plaza was a really bad experience and I would not have recommended to work there. The management was terrible while I worked there
bad,"I did not have fun working here. Mangement was rude, unfair and does not know how to do her job. Holiday she let me worked by myself and push me too hard to finish everything. Next day or 2. My both knee  and legs hurt so bad like i have needle all over. Have to rest 3 days before i get back to work."
bad,"i am currently working at sears in falls church virginia for 9 years now as a part timer, i would not recommend this to any of my friends because of their unbalance treat to their associates such as giving more work hours for their associate that they think are very useful to them the most and give a less hours for others and also for not giving people a raised, as you may all know, sears company is going down hill, in order for them to save their expenses and money they would get rid of some higher position, in fact few days ago they had decided to get rid of about 5 higher position in our store as well as some of our part timers which was never expected from us (it would've been me without knowing) which i'm finding it really unfair for all of us here."
bad,Typical retailer. They want you to make the money at the cost of your livelihood. Very little room for position growth. Another job that can be ruined by upper management
bad,"The management at most instances were terrible. I received very little pay, and the schedule was very inconsistent. Occasionally I would be left of the schedule for weeks or months at a time."
bad,I was hired for winter work and was very limited on how many hours they would offer me. Most days they only gave me 4 or 5 hours when I was used to 40 plus. My manager did not even know my name.
bad,"Sears was a great place to work. But that was fifteen years ago. Sears went down hill when Kmart bought them out. Since then all the big wigs cared about was making a profit. that's not the worst thing, but the stop caring for their employees. They would cut our hours and we would not get holiday pay, our benefits were cut in half and we could not transfer to another department. The company is going bankrupt, so I would not recommend applying at any Sears stores, unless all you want is some extra money to spend.You can get the hours that you want and they will work around your schedule."
bad,typical day when i worked was to make sure the floor is fully stocked and cleaned. Help the customers find the merchandise they need or if we didn't have it I would order it online for them. Occasionally cash people out if needed.
bad,"Outdated facility, underpaid, understaffed, and horrible management. Worked for 4 years and at one point it became so depressing to work there, I quit without another job lined up. The managers all talk so much cr(ap) about other department managers and do each other dirty with gossip. Toxic environment."
bad,if you weren't a long time employ you didnt get the hours you needed and if you worked in the warehouse you were treated like trash the pay was 9.50 which i felt should of been more but hey they got shut down and closed for a reason
bad,"when i started working i had the best manager one could of asked for, after he had retired and next managers never came close to how my first manager rated."
bad,"Little hours to work with meaning management has to pick up lots of extra work that usually associates should be there to do. The future of the company can be seen in the stores and work environment, that being the company is on its way out."
bad,"Go over night crew notes and video and secure the floor to make sure there is no hazards or violations."
bad,Poorly trained management and Im expected to do my jobs and everyone else's and not get paid for it and get berated if it isn't done.  I'm Not a manager. I shouldn't habe to be responsible for others as a regular associate
bad,My manager was extremely critical with out being able to know the polices himself. I was promoted quickly into a management title and had little to no training when being placed in the position. If I asked for assistance I was put down. So only go after this job if you are extremely self sufficient.
bad,"Lot of turnover at this company. Also, company was not doing well financially. This is a company that may not be around in a few years, so I would not recommend working here unless you are desperate."
bad,Enjoyed my job duties and my department. Loss Prevention was/is so gratifying. Sears had a very poor Management system when I was there that caused me to cut my employment there short.
bad,My typical day at work was to meet the managers and co-workers for a early morning meeting to explain the day and determine how much we can sell that day on the routes.
bad,"They didn't give much hours. The store manager was really mean and didn't know how to deal with people. The system for the sears credit cards is the worst. In a slow day, with a shift of 4 hours sometimes I had to do at least 4 credit cards applications. The only good thing about working at Sears were my coworkers."
bad,A typical day as a sales associate was slow. Management kind of worked with your needs. Got paid $6 plus commission. Gives you a lot of experience with many types of customers and also merchandising.
bad,I worked for sears auto center in York pa for 15 years. the people I worked with were great. they helped to provide a fun work environment. however the pay and upper management needed to improve. the was no room for advancement. several managers came and went within one years time over the years. I stayed because of the people and cause I what little choses were out there. the auto center closed down and now I am looking for something new to dedicate myself to
bad,"Right now, Sears stock is less than $9 a share. In 2012, Sears stock was over $40 a share. It is just a matter of time before Sears declares bankruptcy. In light of this, I would not recommend Sears as a viable place of employment."
bad,"for someone who has children and life expenses i would not recommend this job. The pay rate is low, so you will not make enough to pay bills, yourself or your children."
bad,"A typical day at Sears would usually involve clocking in, and standing behind a register for very long periods of time with almost nothing to do. When customers would approach the register either to pay for an item or their credit card bill, it would take about 4-5 minutes because of the very outdated computers we had to use for the register. Most of the day would consist of just standing around waiting for something to do, whether it was putting the merchandise of the floor from the trucks, or putting any returns/exchanges back where they go."
bad,"They hype you up claiming you make a lot of commission and make the job sound fun in training. Once you actually do the job, you realize it's a constant competition for commission and the job is diffifcult to perform well. Feels like you're trying to force people to buy stuff they don't want instead of giving them what they want and letting them go."
bad,"Loved working for customers. Politics behind the business not so great. The man i worked for was very nice but two faced. Liked it at first. learned a lot about appliances, but other employees were getting more benefits had to start questioning why."
bad,Sears was temporary so i could support my self while i was attending college at the time.It wasn't bad but it wasn't great employees would walk about on the job on the regular basis
bad,"Due to the circumstances within the company the last few years, it is very evident that Sears is failing considerably. As a consequence of this, in my experience I noted that those who managed to stick around and ""hack it"" were like me; hardworking, beyond a fault and willing to stick around and deal with the terrible situation of the store and company at large because of the great people who were included in the staff, who to me and others became almost like a second family."
bad,"I have learned a lot at Sears over the years. I have been given the opportunity to lead great teams, work with many smart people, be part of learning processes and manage very large budgets. The environment is incredibly stressful and morale is very low. It's a challenging environment to thrive and succeed in."
bad,"Your in store managers try their best to keep in touch with associates but your market level managers are disconnected. They don't care about the individual associate, just how you do on metrics. And in sales it is cut throat with associates doing anything to get ahead and make a dollar including undermining you."
bad,"The state of this company is sad. Leadership is willing or unable to see that if the company made its employees happy, the employees would then in turn make the company's customers happy. Instead this company offers low salaries, subpar benefits, minimum vacation and holiday days, no training, no employee discounts, instead of employee discounts the company makes its employees sign up for the Shop Your Way rewards program.  In the words of the topmost leadership, every employee should get a Sears credit card.  Heavy push on getting and promoting these credit cards."
bad,"I was part time but they would schedule me for only three hour shifts. Most of the time you were alone so you had to do web orders, assist customers, and deal with management that would not help at all!"
bad,i don't really have an opinion about this company. you can get what you need and then get out......... so that's pretty cool... i guess...............
bad,"A typical day of work begins with returning customer voicemail; checking portal for orders, submit refund, answering calls from customer and technician. I've learn to work independently. The hardest part is the pay.  The most enjoyable are my co-workers. The workplace culture is to provide great service. Sometime management are not supportive of their co-workers."
bad,Didn't really like the location and the management was not great to me. Its been a few years so it possibly could have gotten better. Absolutely HAD to sell credit which was hard considering the location.
bad,Absolutely no work life balance in the store in worked for. Favoritism in upper management. Immature behaviour in upper management. Store manager had no clue what they were doing. Often did not get day off and was asked to cancel vacations. Worked 12-16 hr days with no compensation as you are salaried management the law doesn't require so. Often worked past midnight and was required to go in the next morning 7 am. Good salary until you calculate how many hours you work. You end up below minimum wage!
bad,"This would still be where I would be working if not for the poor district manager and his choice of store management. I worked here for 5 years and he went through 5 branch managers, all because of his poor branch management selection. I did have 2 great managers while working there but, they chose to leave for better opportunities elsewhere. Other than the aforementioned reasons. great place to work."
bad,"My typical day at work has become a routine. I have learned great skills of the basic auto care which I am thankful to have obtained with this company. Management will take care of my requests to a certain degree. The workplace culture has a high demand of productivity. The hardest part of my job is finding a new challenge to learn how to do a new job on a service vehicle and being approved to carry it out. Once I have found that new challenge with approval to proceed, it becomes the most enjoyable part of my job, which is learning."
bad,"working for sears is something i would not recommend to any one at all. hard work will not be rewarded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"At work I would usually stand at the register waiting on the few amount of customers that would walk through the door and hopefully purchase an item here. More than half of people who walked in the door did not purchase anything. I would wait around 15-20 minutes at a time on one customer to walk through the line. I was usually the only cashier in the store so if we became crowded it would take a long time to check out all the customers. The management was usually unhelpful when I was in need of assistance. For example, numerous times I would need another associate in the front end in case there were many customers at a time. However, whenever I called for assistance, they would come over and help maybe three out of ten times. I found working there incredibly uneventful and difficult work at times when it came to stocking shelves by myself where the items were heavy and large. I would not recommend any person to work there. They do not pay a great amount and you end up working there more than you would expect for a part-time employee with no benefits whatsoever."
bad,"If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. Aspects of management, organization and life/work balance sucked. The computer access I needed to do a good job, was not good."
bad,When I worked there- 1986-1992- it did not pay as much as it should have. Management was often disorganized and dysfunctional. The CEO made up to 100 times what hourly workers made which was not fair.
bad,"overall very bad place to work.collection of losers .management is very bad they don't do anything ,store is always messy .sears don't care about custmer service ."
bad,"Low morale and uncertain future, senior leadership turnover at a high rate leaving culture and vision to change frequently. no clear strategy or consistency of message"
bad,I am thankful for the job offered by Sears but feel that they have serious issues to resolve before I could recommend them as a place to work. Could only recommend working there part time if the provided income was not a necessity.
bad,"It is like re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic at Sears these days. Signed on to try and make a difference and ended up accomplishing a lot in my area, but was dismayed with what I saw going on in other areas. Run by a hedge fund manager who is expert at ringing every once of value from an asset. This is often not in alignment with an associate focused culture."
bad,"Good workplace techs are knowledgable assistant manager is nice and helpful store manager is a slouch, whom is difficult to work with  and has no real knowledge of the job. also can be very rude to customers"
bad,"Muy mal ambiente laboral, muchas horas de trabajo por un sueldo miserable y no pagan tiempo extra"
bad,"Overworked and under paid, I really have nothing good to say about this job. They are unorganized one manager will tell you one thing then the next another. No one in the store has the same goal the day shift workers are more favored then the night time workers."
bad,"The pay is horrible, the managers are terrible and so uptight. They love pushing credit onto customers and cashiers suffer if they don't ruin someone's credit score by the end of the day."
bad,The employees and managers are what made Sears a good place to work. The company is struggling and the changes they are making are affecting employee satisfaction towards their job. I think once they get past this most recent phase of change at the company Sears will be an enjoyable place to work again.
bad,"Seas was just a job I needed just so I can have some steady income while I do my nursing courses. but working there I learned nothing was steady, I sometimes found myself doing other peoples jobs because they were lazy or didn't show up to work. lets just say I'm glad I don't work there anymore!"
bad,"Working in merchandise pickup was ideal on paper as a student. Part time gig, plenty of exercise from walking and lifting things, and you didn't have to talk to people very much. Despite the benefits, management failed on multiple occasions to alter my schedule to fit my school and life needs by lowering my hours, despite having plenty of other employees who were getting far less hours than me."
bad,"Wanted a full time position, but only got a part time one. Very little to no room for advancement. Management is not helpful and is pretty lazy. The schedule is not consistent week to week and Sears offers no benefits to part time workers."
bad,"I didn't bother learning people's names, because they were going to be gone the following week. The goals the company set are guaranteed to push customers away.  Day to day was a little slow, it was just me putting on tires, and changing oil. Other technicians werr helpful, and they helped me learn a lot."
bad,"Basically, I liked this job except for no raises, no benefits, and no chance of promotion or management.  Personally I do not believe Sears Holdings will be around by Jan. 1.  Balanced Safe, balanced and made deposit daily, ordered change as needed. worked extensively with LP to resolve shortages."
bad,"Decent place to work besides having to call a switchboard and leave a message when you need to get a hold of a manager eg. calling in sick, or in general needing to speak to the person above you. Makes it feel very in direct."
bad,There's no hours to give out so you hardly work and when you do you are by yourself. They expect you to do everything and managers are lazy but the other employers are nice and fun to talk too.
bad,Tough place to work for outsiders not born and raised in the area. I was welcomed on the team like a starter and then put on the bench when my opinion or experience did not align with the popular opinion of high school buddies.
bad,Company does not care about employee retention. Staff is overworked and underpaid. Store managers treat employees like lower class humans. Typical failing corporate business
bad,"Wasn't my favorite job, mainly because the pay was low. Other than that it was a pretty good job. Work was fun because I like lifting. Co-workers were fun to work with."
bad,People who have worked for this company for years get fired due to their position being terminated. You will always be fighting for the right to keep your job due to cutbacks.
bad,"From the very beginning of my stay at Sears I felt left to my own devices and without any real guidance. The computer training did little to prepare me for the job and was forced to learn most of my duties and proper procedure on my own usually through trial and error. On my very first day on the sales floor I was scheduled alone in my department with no register training whatsoever and was not even issued a login number making check out of any customers impossible. My ""rookie"" mistakes were often dealt with by reprimands by management in ways I would describe as harsh. I was mislead by my pay rate and commission rate during the interview process and made no where near the estimations I was given. When the top salesman in the tool department is clearing over a thousand dollars a day on average in sales and barely clearing minimum wage there is an issue with the compensation. The poor and often times overly harsh management made matters all the worse. I had to console distraught coworkers more times than I care to admit after they drew the ire of management. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless the management style of the company is massively overhauled. "
bad,"Very stressful work with little to no pay. Great for a high school job but not any room for advancement. Management pushes for commission, no commission =no hours. 4/10 would recommend."
bad,Pull in all direction without goals. Management is totally screwed up and they have no clue on what to do. They are just trying to save their jobs and that is whole aim of their jobs.
bad,Everyone worked on a strict point system including managers which was uncomfortable as we were always being told about something we did wrong or something we needed to improve.  Never any thank yous or an occasional pat on the back even for very knowledgeable employees.  I was a seasonal employee for Christmas.  We were given a training program on a computer and then put on the floor with the assistance of a long term employee so there was a lot of merchandise to learn about in a short time.coworker  My manager did as good a job as the corporate rules would allow.  Another manager we had when ours had a day off was sarcastic and unreasonably demanding.. Moral was somewhat low and some of the employees were very competitive because of the commission pay.
bad,"The job was not hard just an hostile environment. Due to poor management , unpleased customers and lazy co-workers. It came natural to me because I enjoy selling the products to the customers."
bad,Tal vez tiene varias oportunidades pero mi experiencia no fue muy buena
bad,During my interview I was told that I had the potential to be making 18$ an hour.  Because of the poor commission rates I am making 12 dollars (base pay) with no commission because the commission goes towards paying off your hourly wage. On a 4700 dollar sale I made with no adjustments or exceptions for the customer I made under 200 dollars.
bad,"Unorganized "
bad,Job ok. closed down so don't know why im writing this review. So im just writing random words just to get the characters up. But ok job. Lousy pay. nice people
bad,"This was my first job, I personally liked working there but the hours kept conflicting with my work schedule, making me constantly late for class, being a full-time student my grades started to slip because of the excessive hours."
bad,Typical day at work would be folding clothes and cleaning up around the store. The managers are usually cranky and don't really do much. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with rude customers. The other workers were usually pretty nice and easy to get along with.
bad,"Sears offered nothing good. Scheduling was never consistent. Pay was minimum wage. Advancement in the company was unlikely unless you knew management, or someone from HR."
bad,"This company does not care about its employees, or their pay. It is however a company of opportunities. I moved up, and became ASM. However, the pay is awful, and they hours suck, too. The company as a whole is going down the drain. Doesn't mean I don't love them though."
bad,"The financial health of the company has all employees concerned for their future, and job security. The company has decreased hours, and authorizing just single coverage to handle Shipping/Receiving."
bad,"No one does their job it's all about who you know. cashiers don't just stay in the register they get sent to the back room and help out with merchandise, they have to clean, fold clothes and help out every department that needs help. Management is really bad, they don't want to deal with customer problems so cashiers have to deal with them. The only good part is that it's not busy at all during the week and get to do whatever you want if managers like you."
bad,"Horrible. Almost no work hours. Very little pay. Forced to con people into get their credit card, which has one of the highest interest rates. Managers have a bad attitude."
bad,they expect way to much out of you a d pester you constantly. different shifts pick threw what they dont want so other shifts are left with the hardest things so its pratically impossible to make rate anymore and the managers KNOW this and they say it stinks but do nothing about it and STILL hound you about rate! you get a write up if your on overtime and come in 5 minutes late . all of the good managers are gone now and the ones that are left behind have favorites. a lot of time first shift overtime will be cancled but second shift will need to stay.  i do not reccomend at all
bad,"The company has provided many wonderful opportunities, I have learned so much and have made many friends.  Would like to be able to do more to save the company."
bad,Avoid it if you can. They expect too much from their employees . They dont train you for anything y5wt expect you to do everything. They do not value their employees
bad,"The experience I gained was great and the Store manager was great, they expect too much for too little and the other management does not manage. People don't respect your personal and work space."
bad,"Lack of job objectives, unrealistic requirements. Wages were low and raises are tiny and lack structure. Floor level workers are poorly treated and middle management is hung out to dry"
bad,"Store manager had no idea what he was doing. I was lucky to get 10 hours a week.. I was also never trained, my first day I was just thrown out on the floor so the whole time I worked there I honestly had no idea what I was doing, I had to teach myself what to do."
bad,"Being a sears tech has its moments. I love working and solving problems. Being a team player is very important. Helping customers with their problems is very awarding,"
bad,I'm not sure whether to talk about the amount of disrespect that takes place or the expectation of the amount of work that needs to be accomplished.
bad,"This company is dying and is about to close all stores. The only thing they are having that's keeping them is the tools department. It is dead most of the days, the weekends are that much better either."
bad,"typical day at work is assisting customers, straightening the store, answering phone calls, and checking people out. management is okay not the best. nothing about the job is hard. most enjoyable part of job is my customers. love to communicate."
bad,"Retail portion was horribly managed and work wasn't there due to no business. Very slow and boring with horrible pay and hours. The automotive section was somewhat better, but the business wasn't there or the opportunity to advance your career. Was a lot more enjoyable if your into working on cars or just have a passion for it like I did. Very simple and easy with good training"
bad,"A miserable place to work if you are a backroom associate. I worked almost 8 years in the back room, was recognized as an outstanding worker, but never saw a raise during my entire tenure. During the same time, the workforce was cut in half, the jobs assigned to workers doubled, hours were cut but demands doubled. I stayed because I like to work and I didn't need the paycheck to survive. I also saw terrible leadership at the manager level. Screaming at employees in front of other employees. Unwillingness to provide priorities to understaffed leads, and general unprofessional behavior."
bad,"Management bites, they don't really acknowledge you or what you do. Don't think management is there to help you, they only look out for them. Average guys though are cool and friendly."
bad,Most of my working hours are in numerous of meetings and could not start my working until after hour and hence very low work and life balance at Sears.
bad,"Sears was my first job and well.. You know how first jobs go; great in the beginning with decent money and then goes down hill from there."
bad,"It was decent very dull and depressing settings, co-workers constantly talked bad about each other and etc/ which made me feel uncomfortable. Certain people could wear certain things and seemed very racist."
bad,"This job was never predictable. What I learned there I had to teach myself. The upper management was never there. When my home flooded this last year, they did not care. The General Manager had just quit about a week before the flood. I had to take care of my family and my home. When they had to use other resources to run the shop. I got the blame for it."
bad,"Sears Fashion Square was a very lively place and functioned like an extremely well oiled machine with its great staff and associates. Showing up to work was a pleasure at fashion square. After my transfer due to the Fashion Square Sears Closing, I was promised a specific osition however that never came through after 3 weeks of the management telling me ""Next week"". As a Student they paid minimum but really worked around my schedule. Unfortunately my expenses where rising and i needed a better position which they promised, but sadly never delivered."
bad,This company will work you very hard with private contaractors who pay you little. Although the cstomer service experiences are educational .
bad,The company as a whole is struggling very badly and the future of the company is looking very grim.  The pay is below what the industry is paying and the commission rates are at an all time low.
bad,"Pros: They almost hire anybody"
bad,"Searsholdings is not a place where you can plan a long career due to poor upper management, store are closing around the nations... which makes for a stressful environment"
bad,"Been with Sears for almost 5 years and at first, it was a decent job while in school. Now, after years of getting to know the business and people running it, I can confidently say that Sears is on it's last legs as a company."
bad,This company has a problem where favoritism runs deep. Mostly those who worked hard and did things the right way dont get promoted left and the slackers caught all the breaks. Wont be a bit surprised if this company goes out of business forgot what made them successful which is customer service a priority over being in it just to make money.
bad,"The potential income is tremendous but at a cost. First, the training was inadequate. Second, the pricing you work with is not near as competitive as stated. Management thinks nothing of dominating your waking hours five days a week."
bad,"The management at my store lack accountability. They do not apologize when they make a mistake nor do they value their employees. The manager has been with Sears for awhile, under a different capacity, so he has no idea, or so it seems, what my position entails. I enjoy working with my colleagues, but if you were to ask any employee, our biggest gripe is our management. "
bad,"Old system, angry customers, not enough to do. Not as much teamwork & effort put into the job. Whack"
bad,It was only 18 hours a week. It was a part time job. I kinda miss working there. it was okay for a part time job. The hardest part of the job was only be able to work 18 hours a week and cleaning the store when it was open.
bad,"Several years of no annual increases, very frustrating to not receive management support. Huge turnover from managers and employees."
bad,"Management wasn't good, hours were terrible because I was one of 3 employees covering the floor as a service writer. The job wasn't that great for me and my schedule, that and personal issues I had with the job were why I left."
bad,"If you want to work with a company where the leadership knows your name, this is not the place for you. They are a large company in the process of a turnaround. Because of their position, they expect a lot out of their remaining associates."
bad,In my opinion great managers at this location. Great opportunity for first time job or secondary job. This job is is not a career or Dependable job if you live on your own. The management program is almost non-existent there are no opportunities to move up there are no full-time opportunities. The most you will make it this job is minimum wage. Depending on how Corporate feels about hours for the month depends on how many hours you get for the week. This location has a problem with its scheduling by not scheduling enough staff to properly run the store they create stress on the employees that are trying to make up for the lack of help. Due to the lack of help the store's customers are frustrated and take that frustration out on the employees that are working. This is the reason for high turnover at this location.
bad,Lots to say always stressed about 10 metrics you NEED to meet all the time and too many things to put in every shift. Expected to remember how many you wait on and so on. Credit is always stressed and need to sell extremely high priced protection plans. Your always pushed to do more than your job title. And managers always giving you work of others to do and you have no time to sell if you want to get all tasks done. Pay is good when you have time to sell.
bad,"If you  are going to school  and just need a part time job  this is the place for you to work, it's not going to pay the bills  but it's a great start when you are just getting out of high school"
bad,"No raises and no advancement, but they will work around almost any schedule. Slow paced, good for just out of high school kids or for kids going to go to college or in collage."
bad,This job was full of ups and downs. Mainly every employee for themselves and little to none communication. Management is horrible.
bad,"Trust me when I say this, Sears is NOT a nice place to work. The management is extremely poor! The management is rude, they're judgmental, they don't let you take breaks (if you do, you get a warning), etc. My manager would constantly say ""iffy"" things about customers and their ethnicity... I HATED working with people like that. I hated going to work, and I couldn't wait to leave. The older people that have worked at sears for 20+ years are so old fashioned and think so negatively. It was honestly the worst place I've ever worked. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work at Sears. To top everything off, I have years of cosmetic experience, I have a certificate for makeup artistry and I've worked with some VERY talented and well-known people. SEARS ONLY WANTED TO PAY ME $11.50 and hour. practically minimum wage. Sears is a JOKE. I thought they'd be closed by now."
bad,"The company is consistently coming up with new ""ideas"" to better the business. Problem is, none of the managers, store level and up, do not communicate. So you have several different managers telling you to do something different. The associates in the building are very fun to work with. The customers that do come to Sears are very loyal. Sears has A LOT to teach, however, the entire business strategy is devised from reports instead of actual business practice and observation. From my experience, their is very little room for advancement, and if their is, it's very hard to achieve. Raises are almost non existent. We have associates that have worked for the company for over 15 years and never received a raise. Sears is what I like to call a 'filler' job. Something to take up the time in between careers. Not what I would call a permanent position or any kind of career."
bad,A typical day of work here includes little to no direction from management unorganized tasks and poor communication between co-workers. During my time here I have learned the best way to help achieve conflict resolution between individuals. The management wasn't trained effectively and as a result demonstrated poor leadership responsibilities to their workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a very chaotic work space while still trying to maintain production. The most enjoyable part of this job was the amount of flexibility they offered you.
bad,"Kmart isn't the worst place I've worked for, but it wasn't the best either.  As a cashier (not sure about other positions), I made minimum wage, which I think is ridiculous for such a large company.  I also didn't get very many hours.  So my paychecks were pretty small.  "
bad,"Long hours and stress for little pay. A lot of hard work put in with very little benefits. Not well organized, and to many heads saying what to do."
bad,"In my experience I have seen some of the top performers go unrated or under appreciated. I've seen valuable employees work hard everyday and get chosen over for pay increases, while employees that do not value their jobs get top performer certificates.  They have a very high turnaround so far as employment."
bad,"I would be assigned a department to scan to print replenishment tickets, assists customers with their purchases, straighten the floor and dressing rooms."
bad,would not recommend. easy work but made harder buy the management. hours are cut all the time. Not good pay for what your asked to do.
bad,"We had some of the worst managers at Kmart.  A few of them made you think, how on earth have these people gotten so far in customer service when they are horrible to both customers and other employees.  It was very unorganized and there we're never enough people scheduled to assist customers, which customers easily noticed and pointed out.  They had recently made the job part-time which was hard on some people.  It knocked people out of any benefits.  Definitely not the best place to work for."
bad,looking for a change so far i have seen a lot of unprofessional. I also have not been given any type of help from the HR department when i ask for clarification on things.
bad,on a une formation continue mais pas de grand possibilité d'avancement..
bad,"I did not like to work there. I didn't feel like there was an opportunity for advancement of any kind. I did like my CAC leader, but he/she no longer works there either. I also made some friends, who also not longer work there. The hours opening were decent compared to some places."
bad,"Its hard to move up, its an easy job. "
bad,In the particular store that I was at the management was not very good at all. The only way to get benefits is if you were a full time employee. It seemed in order to move up in the company you have to know someone or you would just be moving around from department to department without a raise.
bad,"Two managers, no reason"
bad,"Working at a photography studio was my favorite job. I enjoyed working with people, especially the children. I enjoyed making the customer's happy with the work I was doing. It was a lot of fun."
bad,This is a bad place to work at. They fire you if you don't sell enough credit cards. Its unfair. also they cut your hours if you don't sell enough credit cards. They are ridiculous.
bad,I have no public comment on the success or failure upon this company management nor its future outlook. Each person must make their own judgements when dealing with this company.
bad,There are managers in the stores that have been there for too long and have no ambition to move one which doesn't allow you the freedom to move up in the company. You have a better shot of being a store manager coming from the outside of the company then moving up the chain. OOO but wait then youll get thrown in to a store and company you know nothing about to learn everything by yourself. In 10 years I saw 6 store managers and countless BC managers. So happy I left.
bad,"There are some good people in the company, but the company is stuck in the past.  The employee discount is laughable as it's only 10% most things can be bought for less with regular coupons.  The big store and auto centers seem to be warring factions and there is very little communication between the two."
bad,"Terrible company, no regard for worker welfare.  No matter what decision you make, it will be overwritten by management. No communicated company direction from top."
bad,"The enviroment is not a good one. The management is bad, they don't have a good organization plan in terms of decisions. One day is one thing, the next day is another. The consistency of a team basis working area doesn't show up, and that is what loses the motivation in the employees."
bad,Bad management and Corporate. They recently cut pay so if you worked there for a living there is no way to make it anymore.
bad,Who you work with defines this job. I had an awesome manager but my coworkers sucked. The job was mundane but wore on my feet and back a lot due to the cement floors. Pressure to sell their credit cards was also very high
bad,The first few months of employment here was ok. After that everything was just do this and do that. Stuff that wasn't part of the job. Leads were just people that have been there since HS. They look miserable and reflect it in every way possible. The store manager doesn't even have cash register knowledge whatsoever. He just orders employees around. Has little knowledge on store services in general. Just a joke.
bad,"It is not bad working with people who are generally nice. However you get treated like a child and management plays little games with schedules. Also, if you like weekends with friends and family, this is a bad place to work. I worked there for 2 years and for 2 years I have missed every event that falls on weekends; which is pretty much everything. Pay is not good for what all is required."
bad,"Had to work crazy hours, which kept me away from family time. Was also forced to work holidays and it was mandatory to open up credit cards for customers."
bad,"I worked at Sears and it was very hard to focus on my job when there was so much change constantly happening in the leadership. There were always rumors about the company closing ""at any minute""."
bad,"I started at Kmart 4420 during the holidays. I enjoyed it in the beginning. The management was cool, I made a few friends with the staff. Then, things began to change. The soft line manager started becoming a total dictator!!! And, the environment became hostile. So, I quit."
bad,"Sears is a customer oriented profession, without customers sears cannot succeed. Management wasn't very enthusiastic assisting customers or staff,very slow when answering call for assistance. Co-worker are more apt to act as team members. Work is more rewarding when a team work together in unity. The best part of the job is seeing satisfied customers."
bad,"Most days the store manager provided an extensive and exhaustive to do list that consisted of more things then could possibly be done in one shift. Store 7552 was under constant fear of closing as corporate was shutting stores down without warning to the store, employees would show up for work and find the doors locked."
bad,Go in start taking call make sure you offer your extras to make extra money go on lunch do it again till time to go home then come back again the next day
bad,In retail you are always walking the line between investing in resources and maximizing profits. Decisions made everyday will determine the success of the company but the general employees have very little input on these decisions.
bad,"I worked on full commission.  experienced sales staff with five or more years sales experierience were working one minimum wage guarantee, as they were not able to earn enough commissions to take home more than the minimum wage.  Management was cheerful about their future prospects because they were losing less money than the store was losing five years ago!!!!!  The customers are all in the eighties!!!!"
bad,Sears as a company is a good store to work for if you are lucky to get good management. My ASM only had two of us work on the busiest weekend then proceeded to yell at us when we couldn't straiten the whole store.
bad,"low-grade customer service"
bad,No disrespect to this company but it was really a joke from Kmart to Sears. I mean the pay sucked and the hours they give you were even worse. I couldn't stand the customers have of the time. It was all a waste of time.
bad,"Sears is always hounding you to pitch credit cards, even if the person has one to open another one since they have 2.  Not everyone needs a credit card, and they get aggravated when you ask 100 times.  I didn't enjoy working there much because of that simple fact.  They rated you as an employee based on how many credits you got."
bad,First and foremost management can make or break your experience.  I started with a great store manager and department manager who made the day to day experience great and motivated me to give my best performance and actively supported me.  When they were transferred the experience was the complete opposite and it made work almost unbearable. My coworkers started off as a wonderful group of people who had been there for years.  Unfortunately in my tenure many of them left creating a less than favorable team of associates.  The best part was the people I got to interact with every day.  The people who came in were great and helping them find the perfect appliance for their homes was rewarding.
bad,The company touts it's plans to become an online e-tailer bigger then Amazon through it's Integrated Retail Strategy. The result is an unhealthy competition between in-store commissioned sales associates vs the .com sales site.
bad,Great co-workers. Most of management is lazy and non-caring. work days are usally slow and boring. I learned a lot about customer service and how to be and effective and reliable sales consultant. Hardest part of the job was having to worry about making sales and keeping your numbers up while dealing with no products to sell and not many customers to sell to. Most enjoyable was interacting with the customers and being able to help them in any way possible.
bad,Very stressful. No foresight to planning and time management.  Emergencies happen every day. Late work days. Good benefits and salary.
bad,"This job was relatively easy and Sears exhibits pretty good flexibility in working hours. It's a decent side or student part-time job. Other than that, it's really a good place to steer clear from. Store coverage is stretched very thin from both associates' and management perspective. Wages are low and frozen that way. Virtually no possibility of climbing the ladder."
bad,working with Ihop I was never able to get out on time because managers were more concerned about themselves getting out of work and putting everything on the manager.
bad,"I been with Sears for about 3 years now and I'm bout to be 22 years old in a couple of months and I'm ready to earn more money. Living in this world, you cant survive off minimum wage. I'm ready to expand my experience and work in the corporate world."
bad,Been working there for almost 3 years with no signs of advancement. My hours have been cut substantially as they have hired many different workers to share 4-10 hours a week.
bad,"My day starts off with unloading trucks, and then i start my preventative  maintenance work, i might also run merchandise pick up, as well as straighten up the warehouse. management plays favorites, my co workers are pretty good hard workers and easy to get along with. Hardest part of my job is unloading appliance trucks."
bad,Taking inbound sales calls from customers about their products and lawn and garden items. Making sales and voiding protection agreements.
bad,"Nice place too work with a great cafeteria and dining area."
bad,"The company is just trying to keep its doors open and makes cuts in inappropriate paces, such as personnel.  Very stressful workplace"
bad,"I enjoy being able to help new hires, to close good sales, and being able to help me deal in difficult situations, when it comes to ask the key way, to motivate a customer, to apply for a new store credit card."
bad,"This company is overcome with concern for metrics.Customer service is secondary, contrary to there mission statement."
bad,"Though this was a great place to dive into the retail would it was not a conducive environment for growth in any aspect. "
bad,The entire team at Sears worked very hard and knew how to have a laugh.  It was a good place to work.
bad,"Identifying customer needs to provide appropriate solutions to customer inquiries."
bad,"Your compensation is good when you make a sale. When new sales people are hired, you lose quality and quantity of leads."
bad,"You have the potential to make lifelong friendships which make the work environment much more tolerable, but the job is a joke and management are like medieval royalty and the associates are like the field workers. They are kept separate as much as possible."
bad,"Manager will make sure that everyone is working; after a few hrs on the floor; they will not pay too much attention to what everyone is doing and not providing any work assignments to anyone on the phone. "
bad,"I did not have an issue with the position being slightly above minimum wage and involving manual labor. These were clear expectations before I accepted the temporary position. However, I did have a problem with the culture and lack of safety. E.g., I was helping unload a bedframe from a truck. My manager, who was at one corner, pushed the frame to the point where I almost fell off the truck, and would've been seriously injured. He was completely oblivious and uneducated in a safe process for the kind of work he managed on a daily basis. As for the culture... Many people were very condescending to those they perceived as beneath them. Not just in attitude, but in snide comments as well. There was also animosity, one department toward another, and constant bickering about departments not doing their jobs. This culture created angry, disillusioned employees who couldn't wait to leave the company. Unless, of course, they were content with this kind of treatment or were making enough to endure it. Harsh words, yes. But very true. Perhaps Sears will see this review and do something about it. Or perhaps they're happy with their culture as is. If this isn't the employment culture for you, employee beware."
bad,"Sears is not a company to consider working for if you have a family, or bills to pay. I worked here right out of high school so it wasn't so bad. But I couldn't imagine working for this company now. Work environment was fast-paced, and not rewarding at all with pay."
bad,"this place is a dead end job. meet really nice people working there, but also some really not so nice people. customers can be very rude here."
bad,"•	Greet and assist customers with inquiries about products"
bad,"I worked here for two years and every single day I went in saying, ""today's the day I'm going to quit."" Because I just hated being there. It's a good first job, for about 6 months, and then I would suggest that you look for another job. This pays 7.25 an hour with no opportunities to get a raise, but yet they expect you to have the best numbers across the board. If you're desperate for money,  go here. Otherwise, stay far away!"
bad,"Didn't take time to care and get to know their coworkers."
bad,"This is a job where I would only recommend if you are in between jobs. Hours are constantly getting cut and no raises after you get to $8.50 and they expect you to work your butt off to get production out. Really, how can a person live on only $800 a month!"
bad,In sales positions they put a lot of pressure on you and threaten your job daily. I do not recommend Sears if you are going to be in sales.
bad,"I typical day of work for me usually consisted of opening the department by putting the locked up jewelry on display, and taking a count of that jewelry. Then next both registers were counted and opened to service customers needing to make payments, purchase jewelry and other items, and sign up new customers for credit and loyalty programs.  The hardest part of my job was doing yearly inventory counts of every piece of jewelry in the department, it had to be a very accurate. My immediate co-workers were amazing we always worked together as a team with excellent communication. My immediate department manager was very knowledgeable about the department, and what all needs to be done to make the department run smoothly. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely making customers happy with my service."
bad,"My initial impression of Sears was positive, but the job itself was very mind-numbing. Management in general was lackluster with very few people willing to help a new associate and most flat out refusing to help. Work environment was awful, good luck taking a break in peace without some angry employee complaining about random job annoyance #4382 within earshot. You will not be trained in anything relevant to your job, nor will you have any real power to help a customer when they are talking to you. Of course, you can just transfer them to another department and go back to looking at facebook. That's what everyone else does!"
bad,"haute direction incompétente"
bad,working on commission isn't for everyone so be aware. long hours and 6 days a week
bad,"Lots of driving, poor use of routing time, low pay, high turnover."
bad,Typical work day is visiting customer locations. I would say 30% of our technicians actually know what they are doing. The other 70% talk a good game and make it look good on paper.  In my opinion the company is more concerned about selling service contracts and cleaning type supplies than actually fixing customer products.
bad,"I was in charge of taking calls from customers who had questions, concerns or needed service on their product purchased at Sears. . Managers were not hands on and if and when we didn't know what to do we were left hanging. Very high turn around rate so co-workers were constantly changing. The hardest part of the job was  dealing with management and scheduling but I loved interacting with customers and helping them with their problem leaving them satisfied and happy with the company."
bad,"I enjoyed working with customers, and certain coworkers, but overall we did not act as a team should.  Most were focused solely on their own business, making the work environment frequently a hostile one.  When you don't work as a team, its no wonder that the company is doing so poorly.  I did enjoy working with, and for my direct supervisor, but thats about it."
bad,"I enjoyed the job for the duration I had it, but it became too difficult as  more and more responsibilities were added on. I did my best to keep up with everything and I was punished."
bad,"I began working at SEARS with the promise of earning a higher position and pay within 4 months of employment."
bad,Not a good company to work for at all! Poor management and they were always low staffed
bad,Sears does not care about it's employees. They try to get the most out of a person for $11 and hour. Constant lay offs.
bad,Working for Sears as a sales associate is a great first job. If one wants to move up in the company or make more than minimum wage this is not the job for you. The co-workers make the job workable. There is not much room to advance in the company nor is there room to learn other tasks in the company.
bad,"A typical work day I would come in and open the store, turn on computers, check the money drawer, photograph the customers when they came in for their appointments, etc. "
bad,"hard work for very little pay, job satisfaction, encouragement, or respect of any kind"
bad,"A typical day at work check emails, communicate with store manager, schedule hours for managers, walk the store, and dock area, customer pick up. check to see if trailers are off loaded. make sure employees are following OE. coordinate health and safety with leads. The most enjoyable part is helping customers and all the associates."
bad,Let's just say that as an associate their are a lot of benefits and loop holes to ensure payment and employment. As a manager it is frustrating and tireless to get things approved and done.
bad,I liked the job very much my manager was awesome and understanding. ... pay wasn't as good for the jobs I was performing.
bad,"•	Manage multiple Districts and District Service Managers in different states and ensure service levels are maintained"
bad,"In short, the products are great (Craftsman, Kenmore, Lands End, etc.) however the management team has no idea how to operate a sales organization. Please see the slipping profits, store closings and the same executive management/majority share holders doing the same things time in and time out and expecting different results."
bad,"Management was never around when needed and when you can find them they never want to take management calls, I would not recommend this job to anybody"
bad,"Despite my rating, I really enjoyed doing what I did for Sears. However, the company's downward spiral has created a dismal morale. I worked for a store that was closed shortly after leaving. Management had no clue how to treat people, and the pay for hourly associates and lower management was abysmal. The one true bright spot was flexibility in the schedule. This company will be gone in 10 years. Look elsewhere."
bad,Working at Sear's is a lot like working for a friend or neighbor. It always seems like it's going to be a great idea until you get there and find out you don't have the tools for the job.
bad,"This is a fun place to work while being a student and needing money for school.  After achieving a degree or certification, get out as soon as possible.  Most co-workers get along well with each other and have some time for fun at work.  Management is terrible and provide no guidance for their employees.  There is virtually no room for advancement and no benefits whatsoever.  Also, get use to making minimum wage at this company because there will certainly be no room for increasing wages while being an employee for this company."
bad,Management was the worst other then that i liked working at sears
bad,"I was let go due to not pushing their extended warranties at a percentage that require by the company. They mislead customers on the actual details of their involvement in products including but not limited to warranties, shipping, and experience of workers."
bad,"I have worked for this company for over ten years, and its safe to say that this company is going down. When I started the place was Great and couldn't be better. But then the company changed where they started caring about sales and anything that gives them money. The leadership is HORRIBLE and BAD with Inexperience individuals in charge. Run Stay away from Sears, I don't see them being around for years to come."
bad,"A typical day at SEARS requires motivation, organization and timing. In the work place I learned to be self reliant, and to use levers and balancing to move large heavy pieces of machinery. Management at the specific store I was at was very poor, the manager was not associate friendly and was money driven. My co workers were very helpful in my experience, each one was specifically driven to teach me new ways or methods to do the jobs required easier, faster and in a better manner. The most difficult aspect of the job was dealing with misplaced merchandise. The most enjoyable aspect of working in a SEARS warehouse was my coworkers desire to teach me more and push me to do better each day."
bad,I was freelance there and they paid very poorly for a person with experience and a degree.
bad,"The overall morale is not good at all. No incentives, No raises, No company socials, No Holidays Parties or Bonus, No Cost of Living Raises. No Sick Leave. And No Room to Advance."
bad,never want to work there again the management was terrible.
bad,"The team I worked with was good, then as the management started to be switched the team environment seemed to just disappear and I felt more like a Hound then a friend to our customers. Repeat business didn't have very often as we had to basically do everything in our power to make sure the customer didn't leave the store without anything that day."
bad,I was told I had to work Black Friday though i had just found my brother had passed away.  They wouldnt even work with me as far as the scheduling.  i was 6  months pregnant had to start at 8pm till 12 am then back at 6 am though i had asked to work strait through to make it a little easier since it took over an hour an a half to get to work.  We never had enough hours in our department for full coverage   for example the lead was required to work 35 to 40 hours so thats on average 35 hours to the sales associates. (NO OVERTIME)  and our average hours given to the department was 70 and thats being generous.  our hours were 9 am to 10 pm.  so if you do the math there is no way it was fully staffed at all times not to mention we had one of the two womens fitting rooms in the store.  Though with all that said they gave me good feedback and told me at any time they would rehire me.
bad,"Very poor management and overall just a bad company to work for. The company is on wage freeze, so you will make minimum wage"
bad,"Good people, great to work with. However with recent staff reductions  there was an increasing amount of work to do but there has been no increase in pay for several years. "
bad,"I have come to realize that it is very possible to very much enjoy what you do, but not where you are doing it.  I very much enjoy working with the public.  Dealing with difficult issues doesn't rattle me.  I make every effort to not get caught up in the anger/frustration of some customers reminding myself that most are very easy to get along with.  I have learned that if I am to survive in my current position, I have to focus on making the most out of it for myself and making money for myself since I am the primary breadwinner.  The company will not do this for me.  It's my job."
bad,"I am a former employee of Kmart. It was an okay place to work, my co workers were very nice and helpful. Majority of management was not. I witnessed one manager yelling in front of customers quite frequently. It made it very uncomfortable to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and the customers."
bad,"The management was awful.  They didn't tell you exactly what the job was about.  They said some selling but after you get hired you are required to sell their ""customer loyalty cards."" If you didn't sell at least 10 per day that would affect your bonuses and hours."
bad,"Management sucks"
bad,Wouldn't recommend unless you're strapped for cash or need a first job.
bad,sears auto center was a job that was mostly based on comition
bad,"Very low paying "
bad,I worked there for 3 and half years and the bad/immature management drove me to quit
bad,"retail sales, set plan o grams for merchandise, customer service, part time position with no benefits"
bad,"Boss doesn't care about his employees, but only money that comes through selling PA. Expected of us to run everything with min-wage job. Computer system to find orders or send out repair service was just a hassle."
bad,Got Fired for doing the right thing for a customer and giving great customer service. Not a customer friendly company.
bad,"sears was a good place to start an auto tech career.lots of small work ,oil changes,tires,alignments.lots of good beginner stuff to learn from."
bad,The easiest part of the job is actually doing the work. The hard and most stressful part of the job is being under paid and high expectations. Not consistently busy lose hours.
bad,"It was easy to advance while working at Sears, but that may be because no one wants to stay working for a company with no morals and values. Co-workers(besides management) were fantastic and almost always had good attitudes."
bad,"Management gives very minimal direction, doesn't follow through"
bad,"typical day - inventory, marking up or down prices of clothing, helping customers, putting away merchandise, stocking, setting up and taking down sale signs."
bad,"Not a bad place to work, if you like call center. This is not customer service."
bad,"I loved my job, the responsiblities and my coworkers.  I would still be employed there if it had not been for the store manager.  He should not have had the position.  He had no people skills what- so- ever.  I could not take anymore of the verbal and sexual abuse that went on there on a daily basis.  He lied his way out of any accusations that he was confronted about.  It was hopeless.  That had to have been the hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed my coworkers very much.  We were a little family that protected each other from the tyranny.  I also enjoyed the fact that work was so close, I could walk in inclement weather."
bad,good to work with others but the managers cant handle pressure and take it out on the associates.
bad,No raises and it requires a lot of work as a MCA. Management doesnt do anything when you try to address a problem.
bad,the customers were really the only good thing about working for sears
bad,"The typical work day is very busy and fast paced, which is my kind of work. I learned how to do DV scans, stock locate, MSP, print labels, etc. There is a constant change in management for our department alone, which can be tough at times and very unorganized. My co-workers are amazing. Everyone helps eachother out, is very respectful, and works extremely hard to adjust to the different amount of managers we have in short periods of time.The hardest part of my job is excepting the fact that my hours are just going to get lower due to the fact that sears is going out of business. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting up shelves, putting cabinets together, and solving many problems that the customers may have. Sears has been very unstable for some time now. The constant lowering of hours along with the minimum wage pay isn't exactly where I see myself in life at this point."
bad,"Paid minimum wage with a wage lock"
bad,I left customers with special keepsakes that can be remembered forever.
bad,"Sears Service is in rapid decline. Techs are wirelessly networked to central management centers .Routes are long, techs are on the road late until work is completed. Techs must regularly take scarce time out for computerized inventory and part returns. Training is rare, tech support is hit or miss. Sears now has maintenance agreement and impulse item sales quotas. Techs are graded by customer surveys. Techs are on call to provide one another with missing parts. Wireless computers enable the tech to get through the day but they fail regularly. Every aspect of efficiency is categorized and tracked to keep the technician under the thumb of management."
bad,"I come to work make sure the floor is neat an staffable for customers. Im learning how to manage projects an people better in a timely fashion to prep me for management. The people i work with are very good at what they do an make the days go bye fast with finding things to do an making it fun. I love the fact that i get to slove customer issues good or bad to make an impact for that brief moment or as long as they shop at the store,but unfortunately the company or my store says u cant get a raise for working in one department regardless the length of time you have been there so for that i need to take my lessons an retail experience to a higher end company."
bad,"After working there for three years (and counting), I still have not received a raise. The management team for the most part is great, and try to work around your schedule, but there is a great deal of favoritism amongst those in management and those on the floor. "
bad,"I have only worked at Sears or 2 1/2 weeks, and I have already had confrontations with my direct supervisor. She is hard to get along with and yells at her employees for the littlest things. I, along with many others, have complained to upper management about her and the pretty much have the mentality to get over it because they're not going to get rid of her. I guess some of the girls have even gone to the corporate level and complained and nothing has been done about this supervisor and the hostile work environment she is creating. "
bad,"Store meeting, counting money, cleaning, straightening up the store, try to sell credit cards. I learned how to plus sell. Management was pushy. My co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards to customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and customers."
bad,"No good management, everyone seems crabby and don't care about employees improvement "
bad,"poor  management and leadership. The job was easy, but the management team at the time caused a high turnover rate. The pay was minimal for the tasks performed"
bad,sears does not believe in taking care of their people. can never do enough or fast enough
bad,Very inconsiderate of personal matters; unorganized from training to management
bad,"I know this because this became a duty before I quit. Sears was a great company to work for but has severely gone downhill over the past seven years. It was a low stress environment in most stores in the district I worked in. The truth of the matter is the company was hit just like everyone else when the economy started to sink, but it never truly recovered. The corporate headquarters has been shuffling around trying to pass the buck of blame as to the falling profits due to relying on credit card offers and its own rewards program. The new way before I left was to bully customers into signing up or simply hoping they were dull enough to blindly sign up for the offers, only to come in furious after they received unwanted emails or dings on their credit. The majority of heads of management did not care about the loyalty of customers and put numbers first. now they punish the employees for these scorned patrons or former patrons by giving them high and consistent fluxing percentages to achieve daily. They also consistently change the percentages on commission, which leads to inaccurate and grossly low pay. This job is for those with little need for pay or who are truly desperate for work and don't care whether they get paid or not."
bad,Sears roseville Michigan is not a job especially working in MPU (backroom) the mangers look down on you dont care about you. the whole environment is not professional at all. they want you to break your back for 7.40 is not worth it.
bad,"Only apply here if you want flexibility with going to college, other than that stay away."
bad,Look at the SEC filings and read the news about Sears. its not good. Scary to think what is to come.
bad,"The store lacked management leadership from store level to DM. Typical day: Daily check all computers, cashier area, lease depts,before store opening. Held daily store meetings with associates to acknowledge top performers and communicate up coming events. You get more from your associates when you Thank them. Running the store was hard when your management team was not on the same page as you are. The associates and customers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"this internship was for the footwear department, but i was ultimately shuffled around several different areas of the ""design studio"" for sears/kmart."
bad,Overall you shall meet some very down to earth co workers. Competitive battles brings bonds. you learn alot about teamwork. i honesly have not learned anything new there and i dont agree with how compensation has been brokwn down. i enjoy assissting the customers and enjoying good conversation with my co workers.
bad,"I really disliked this job simply because the management was serioulsy lacking, at least at the store I was employed in. When I first started their training was aweful. I was left to figure things out myself and through other co-workers. There was no real training at all. When managers were comfronted with problems with other associates they did nothing about it. All the said was to let them know if it kept happening and when it did they still did nothing. I really cannot say i enjoyed anything about this job."
bad,Get Every Customers information Or lose your Job. Management Sucks!!
bad,"Long days/ very slow business, work mostly by myself, didnt learn much of anything, hard part of day was how slow the day went by,"
bad,"This store was very unorganized. Instead of going through job training my first few days, they put me on the register. Then, month later, they approached me asking how did i get on register if i never did my training. The management was awful there. Some co-works was helpful, but most was rude when i asked questioned. The most enjoyable part was when it was time to go."
bad,"Sears as a company is unfortunately broken in so many ways. Senior management is failing both it's external and internal customers and clients. No work life balance existed, to include mandatory 7 day work weeks, many weeks with no days off and again a toxic, combative work environment. The hardest part of the job was the fact the particular store I went into was a negative EBITDA store and was on the verge of closing in our community."
bad,"Place was terrible. Department was horribly overstaffed per corporate plan. There were 120 hours for 7 employees to share, two of which were full time and needed to work at least 30 to maintain their status. Commission figures were a complete laughing stock and the sales metrics were astronomically outrageous, especially when management scheduled you poor shifts consistently."
bad,Worked with them for a short time about 6 months. I was hired on the spot within my first 10mins of the interview. I'm a good talker and have retail management under my belt. I was told by my store manager I would get an ASM job in no time with her training. I felt the lack of training from my store manager. The guy that trained me in Receiving was good but the computer systems placed in Sears is so out dated it's like working in the 1980's here. I didn't like that at all. I pretty much used this job until I got into a real management job. As the Receiving Supervisor you have to unload the truck by urself twice a week and prep all the appliances and electronics on ur own pretty much. I'm not that big of a guy but my body would hurt every truck day. Pay was $12 an hour for something u can do in warehouse for more. Over all the staff was nice which leads me to say we had about 8 people working in this store... Wow talk about a small staff for a 20K store size. No wonder Sears has problems thank god I'm no longer there as they closed the Sears store down next to the Sears Outlet.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of calling previous customers, trying to offer them a sale.. Photography sessions, and walking around the Sears mall looking for customers who may be interested in scheduling an appointment."
bad,"No chance for advancement, poor pay rate, work every weekend and holiday."
bad,"This company is full of people who do not care to try, so if you do care to try, you could be the cream that floats. The pay is poor, advancement requires relocation, the corporate management is bloated and top-heavy while the floors are poor and ugly. This could be a good place to get into a management position in order to move to another company, but this is not a place to make much money or have a family."
bad,"The company was good to work for in the beginning. Then they started taking things away from you. They stopped the retirement and wet to a 401K program that they helped match. Then they stopped matching that. The eye glass program is a ripoff. you don't save money. Stores give you deals for glasses, but with the insurance for glasses. They charge the full amount to the insurance and not their specials. So in the long run you would pay the same amount if you did not pay for the insurance."
bad,"Sears is a big company that's been around for a long time and they have a large customer base for servicing appliances. I was hoping for a better training program to help me perform my job duties quicker in troubleshooting HVAC equipment. In August, the work load decreased dramatically which caused a lot of technicians to have limited working hours and lower compensation as a result. As a result of that volatilty, it's very difficult to support a family with that kind of uncertainty with your work schedule. I enjoyed working at Sears during my short time there, but they could get more from their HVAC Technicians if they had more hands-on training for them. As a graduate from a 4 year college and many years of working experience, I pursued a 2nd career in HVAC because it's rewarding to help people get their heating and cooling systems going again while being honest and fair to them. I graduated from Tidewater Technical Trade school in Norfolk, VA in January 2012 in the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration field. My gpa was 3.89."
bad,"My day starts with doing all inspections throughout the store then proceeds to any online orders to be retrieved from the sales floor and locating them in catagory bins. I learned an excellent way to keep track of location and items in the location to make order filling quick and easy. My co workers are a varied group of good workers struggling to make a living on Sears Pay scale. For the work I have them do, They should be paid better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of employees we have. There are meny openings, But people will not take a job that only pays minimum wage. This aspect alone creates a hard job in promoting a positive atitude in the warehouse and in the entire store as I am a big part of all the departments."
bad,pues me inclino por la parte mas difisil por que hay muchos preferitismos la empresa es muy buena y el trabajo solo que no hay crecimiento laboral devido a prefencias lo que mas me gusto fue que haciendo bien tu tabajo se pueden notar a personas que creen saverlo todo la direccion gerencia no se interesa por el trabajador no hay motivacion laboral pero cuando sales con la vendision de tu familia creo que esa es la mejor motivacion cuando en tu espacio laboral no la haya
bad,I worked very hard and did very well until a new manager took over and started giving the best leads to the consultants that brown nosed him the most...
bad,"My day started with checking appointments and confirming appointments for the next 3 days. I followed up with potential customers via phone. I then photographed different families and sold photos that were ridiculously priced. At any given time during the week, there was usually one person in the studio. On the weekends, only two. And that got crazy! Appointments could get stacked up because 3 appointments could be booked in any 15 minute slot. I ONLY got paid $8.00/hr for Seasonal and when I got promoted to Studio Associate, I was still $8/hr. It was all about appointments. If you didn't get at LEAST one appointment, you would be written up. It didn't matter how much you did to get an appointment. If you didn't have one in a day, then you got written up. End of story. After a month of working at my new studio, after being transferred due to my original store closing, I started going home depressed. There was no way I could work for them anymore. The regional manager was talking bad about me in the team emails because I had ONE bad week after 6 months of working for them. Seriously? After she practically handed my job to another associate from a different store, I realized I was finished."
bad,Biggest complaint is all management -- the expectations are very high for what little pay that you make. There are no pay raises and not much room for advancement
bad,Basically you are looked at as a possible criminal. Security watches you even when you are on break. Minimal full time employees and the pay rate is meant to keep you poverty level. My whole stock room team was accused of theft. Come to find out security and a member of management were the ones stealing. Not a good experience at all. Not even for someone in desperate need of employment.
bad,"A typical day at work was dealing with the ever changing policies. Every department head had his/her own policies regarding dress code, absence and tardiness etc etc. It was usually very trying to interface with different departments."
bad,"I really liked my job when I first started. The managers were amazing and knew how to deal with employees, customers, and their departments. A few months in those managers were transfered and the replacements mad no effort to get to know me or my department. There were not enough hours to man my department well."
bad,"Sears is a big company and is trying to do all that it can to stay competitive. The competitive nature of the company carries over to its employees and it feels like the way Sears has designed its pay scales, it encourages competition with employees instead of encouraging team work."
bad,"A company being eaten from the inside. Sad to watch. I see Sears as a dead company by 2014, either sold off in bits and pieces to JC Penny and Walmart or turned into a bunch of Super Kmarts."
bad,I loved my job not the pay.Still believe customers are the concern of retail.The company that still realizes this will do well in the economic downturn.
bad,I have learned that customer service is important in order to have a successful company.
bad,"Probably one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Very little regard for the customer or the employee. A bottom line driven business. As long as management is making their numbers, thats all they care about"
bad,"In at 9.00 check mail,work candidates that have applied to requisitions. call candidates,I have learned many things about many people."
bad,Its was a good place to work if they gave you a decent amount of hours. Learned alot about tools and there electronics.
bad,"Low pay with hardly any commission compensation. Management lacked skills, and the store lacked products to make my job easier. Time to have jobs done by don't coincide with when the job was done because no parts on hand. Management wants you to bend over backards for six dollars an hour? Getting time off was difficult and for that pay, dealing with unexpected complications with the customer were outrageous. It makes you know your worth more then six an hour."
bad,PROCESSES AND METRICS MATTER HERE - PEOPLE DO NOT.
bad,"Very stressful, not good paying job, only 8 hours per week no more, favoritism, i was really not happy, the coworkers were not nice at all because it was a commission base job."
bad,Sears is not a good company to work for
bad,"The manager was horrible and very racist and against woman. You were constentla harrased at work all day, but atleast the dm and regional manager stepped in and are working a case against him."
bad,"It seems like management doesn't really know what they are doing. They are constantly under staffed, which cause the few employees there to have to take up extra work loads. They dont train their new employees very well"
bad,This company is terrible. Was told I would be hired as regular part-time and then 3 months in I was told I was being let go because I was seasonal-which is a huge lie. The store I worked for had very unprofessional management that lacked leadership. Pay was horrible for my amount of experience ($8.00) Stay away from this company.
bad,I have worked at Sears for 5 years and the only thing that has changed is the colour of a couple walls. The only time we get a raise is when minimum wage rises.
bad,It was a fine place to work right out of college but not somewhere you would make a career.
bad,"The Sears I worked at was struggling to stay afloat, and after I left it was finally closed down. They did not offer raises, and during meetings the management would blame the employees for Sears's failure."
bad,"I’ve had years of experience in the service industry but I had never been so disrespected by managers and by customers in general. Only work here if you want to be disrespected. It’s so slow there too so every moment feels like an eternity. I’ve had many jobs in the service industry that I liked, but I hated it here because of the disrespect."
bad,"the only thing I liked about this job was some of my co-workers and most of the other associates that worked in different departments. They made the job fun and workday short for me. Sometimes they gave me a headache, but that is what work families do."
bad,"The pay was not enough to get by as it was minimum wage, a lot was expected of employees and it was very difficult to figure things out without managers around."
bad,I wouldn’t refer a friend or family member to this particular location needs help and management and supervisor need to be retrained on how to speak with and deal with employees.
bad,"This job was boring due to the lack of customers. It also pays minimum wage. If you are looking for easy/boring money, this could work. Please do not expect it to be different from working in many of the other low paying retail jobs."
bad,Turn on laptop punch in to get route. Review stops and make space to receive parts and send parts out. Call technicians and do safety meetings. Schedule technical trainings and do technicians inventories
bad,They try to tell u what to do when they never done the job them selfs demanded to much for the lil hours that were given not a good place to work in my opinion
bad,Don't know how many hours you're working until you clock in how many miles you have to drive on average two to three hundred a day pressured on making salrs
bad,Everyone usually was friendly but always in a down mood and grumpy. I felt like I was the only person excited to work and help customers. It was alright though.
bad,"It was a good job. The people I work with where nice. Management was nice, and he was always teaching me new stuff all the time. the hardest was the waiting."
bad,Did not enjoy my time at all. Everyone that worked there would say the same. The job was stressful and lacked organization and the pay and benefits were close to nothing
bad,I can not give a fair review for Sears since all the area stores are closed. I am not sure about the other parts of the country where some are still open.
bad,"I loved the job in the beginning, but they kept hiring from outside the company for supervisor and manager positions. Did not work out well for those people as they didn’t know what they were walking into."
bad,It use to be a great company in the 70-80 but going out of bussnies then went bankrupt sold out our stock an poor manigemeny  it was a great place know it nothing it a sad time when a name company locks it doors for ever
bad,I was not very happy there  job was very demanding and they were going downhill quick  recently I think they closed down and no longer employee here unless it’s sales
bad,"Since the department was kind of competitive, no one really wanted to train me. I basically had to learn everything on my own. Then they had me working in a whole new department that didn't have anything to do with what I applied for."
bad,The supervisors weren't very professional. The supervisors did not care about employees needs. I have witnesses one of the supervisors taking a nap on the clock in the back.
bad,"I worked there for 1.5 years.  I started in the jewelry department and moved into cosmetics.  I liked most of the coworkers but upper management was rude, disrespectful, belittling and catty.  Most stressful retail experience."
bad,"The supervisor over one of the departments I worked in had the personality of a rattlesnake. Nobody enjoyed working with her. There was another lady who had more seniority and experience, with a great personality and she was passed over for the position. Sears was the least enjoyable place I ever worked at and I am one that can normally make the best of any situation."
bad,"customer service was so unorganized, people would ask us cashier where people where that worked in places like tools and we never had ansers the pay is not worth it during the holidays"
bad,Long hours and no credit for job preformense. People in management out for themselves. Quality of products sold below nationwide standards with no customer care.
bad,"Moderate to decent benefits package."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that job hours are changed from week to week so you are never able to make plans or know whether you can pay your bills."
bad,Leadership has no idea how to run a retail company. There is no strategic plan or vision for the company. Everything is reactionary. Collaboration is almost non-existent. Everyone is looking out for themselves
bad,"As an appliance commission sales associate the time you spend is mainly waiting for customers or cleaning appliances. The days are slow since Sears is on a downward slope as far as sales. They give you stuff to do but its simple things but since its commission only it gets frustrating to be rearranging things (which they make you change floor design too often) and make no sales. The sales goals are not easy to hit, attainable, but not easy to hit. Management is overloaded with task so asking for help is useless so customers become upset. Management is poorly trained and higher ups puts too much pressure which then they take out on employees, which leads to negative relationships with management. Turnover rate is very high as a result and creates short staffing almost all the time. As a commission sales person getting money taken out of your check because delivery dept. makes mistakes and allows customers to return products is extremely frustrating. The money gets taken from you for something you cant control and it is unfair if you do your job right."
bad,"Sears was my second entry level job out of high school.  Without realizing it, Sears to me, was a great working experience and I enjoyed working with the other employees.  Taking a retrospective look, the manager clearly couldn't handle the expectations of the corporate world, nor was a professional individual at my retail location.  You could blame it on the economy, the lack of product that people actually want, or whomever was in charge of marketing and inventory.  I figured this falls on the general manager of the store.  A great place for teenagers not the best place for someone looking to move up a company."
bad,"While I did gain valuable sales knowledge thanks to this position, it was a very depressing job. As sales lead, You make $5/hour + commission... the $5 is to compensate you for time needed to handle issues as they arrive & make up for missing out on sales being made on the sales floor. The problem is that the system for solving customer delivery & service problems is flawed. Customers often cancel because issues are not resolved in a timely fashion & or items are damaged (often) during delivery. Sales people lose the commission if the customer cancels in the event of delivery damaging the item. There is no protection for sales people’s hard work being lost because of delivery damaging anything."
bad,"This is the 3rd time i'd been employed by the company and it was clear that the business was in decline. My employ in the mid/late 80's was extremely pleasant, 5 stars in all categories. Now, the company was merely trying to keep the doors open. Competition had taken its toll, credible MGMT had long since moved on and many of the companies core divisions were losing money. My immediate supervisors were doing their best to remain optimistic, but the writing on the wall was clear...Sears was close to extinction."
bad,"Feel like a gear in a machine. Do not treat you like a human with needs. Expect you to fold right into how things work there. If hired for seasonal position , you are nothing to them except a person to help them through the holiday season."
bad,"Poor management, lousy pay, no raises, no employee discount. Hours aren’t that great even as a full-time Associate. (They can only guarantee 30 hours per week)"
bad,"Management were mostly great people. Co-workers seemed to protest about others working. When going beyond job duties you would hear a lot of whimpering. A lot of ""she doesn't have to"" or ""she didn't have to do that""."
bad,"I was pretty new to working period. Working here was an experience to say the least! Your pretty much on your own as soon as you step out on the floor, your teachers a manager if you lucky they have been there over 4 months will try and help you learn to address customers and teach you were each area and numbers are for a product. But since you may not be that lucky you will be taught by your team and not just from your area because I myself and others have had to not only work your designated area but two to three others plus online orders and the cash register. To top it off there will be times when you are the only one associate in those three to four areas (by yourself) having to juggle lawn and garden and exercise equipment all at the same time then have other departments such as clothing and appliances coming to you because no one is in the area. It's pure madness for the most part. Towards the end of my job there were times when there was too many associates on the floor to One associate! There is so much more but not enough room. It's an experience as I said but if your desperate enough and up for a challenge then go for it!"
bad,"Sears as a company I'm sure is fine to work for, but my manager was extremely unprofessional along with my coworkers. Little to no work was done, constant goofing off, and use of drugs and alcohol in the work place by them daily. It became a severely uncomfortable environment for me so I had to leave."
bad,"Greeted, assisted and welcomed customers with their purchase and sales transactions on a daily basis."
bad,They are out of business only for poor management. they do not follow discipline protocol top motivate employees to work harder. Mainly just a bad place to work especially for a firswt job
bad,"*Unloaded the trucks as they came in."
bad,"Company is on a downward slope to it's own demise. No room for improvment outside your own store. Management wasn't bad, it was the boss above my boss"
bad,It was always very slow and there was nothing to really do. A lot of the people who worked there I never really saw because I couldn't leave the counter for everything. Even if I had to go to the bathroom. I would have to wait for a break or for someone to be nice enough to cover me while I went.
bad,"I worked at the Orange Park Mall. They were rude and mean to teens. You get no hours. 7.40 an hour. They change the schedule without letting you know. The job itself was pretty laid back, it was mostly slow. Rarely was fast pace. Worst part of the job itself was gobacks and cleaning the fitting rooms. Registers was easy, the machines are just old. Co workers are competitive and shady. The management is out of this world evil spirited people. The whole hiring process was a lie. In your papers it asks you how many hours you want to work and you will never ever get that many hours. At most maybe 15 hours. And they will not give you a grace period to make mistakes even if you're training. They will fire you the first chance they get. Honestly, my best advice would be to work somewhere else. Take this review as a warning from God cause lord knows if I knew then what I know now I would have NOT put in an application. This job is only good if your working there temporarily."
bad,"Sears is a mess. This place has the potential to be great but management rewards bad and unethical sales associates.  "
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this as a good place to work because it is mundane warehouse work as far as I am concerned. The pay wasn't very good either. Plus, they are closing up all over the place."
bad,"Demanded a lot from you"
bad,"During my time at Sears, the store I worked at was constantly a mess and I was expected to try to help keep it neat. Ended up doing some unpaid overtime to help the store with decorations/reorganization. The hardest part was keeping the clothes looking neat. The most enjoyable part was working the register. I had a couple different managers but only two were typically understanding and decent. Three others weren't as nice and would demand multiple tasks be done in a short amount of time, and the store manager got robbed a few times thankfully while I was off shift. The company is shut down now, kind of unfortunately. Typical days had me just restocking or reshelving items, organizing or helping fix displays, or doing freight work (which was no where near my job description). It was a good enough job as my first job, it just could've been better."
bad,The management stinks here. They no longer care about the employees and the customers we work for. All they care about is how many sales you make. I have worked here for over 2 years and have not gotten any type of raise and I recently found out that new hires doing the same job as me are making more than I am out of the gate.
bad,"Definitely high stress, with random scheduling and irate customers-not all but most. Old technology not intuitive to productive research and product availabilty.Definitely not the Sears I grew up with"
bad,The management was very unprofessional. There was no growing opportunity. The job security was very very low. They have no hope to get better as a company.
bad,"Nothing is worse than working for a company where you feel like a tooth on a cog. Sears could care less if you worked there or were happy or not. Despite their attempts to portray a nurturing environment, Sears was an awful, bureaucratic, soul sucking monster. The idea of trickle down economics can be completely obliterated by companies like this. The job of a business is to make money but the greed of giant corporate retailers like Sears are a disgrace to humankind. NEVER WORK AT SEARS."
bad,"Staff changed weekly. New hires, people quitting and/or moving departments. There was never a real team connection. Most are left on their own with no guidance or motivation. Management never seemed happy or driven to succeed."
bad,"I came into my position at Kmart rite wen they started closing the store and it was around the holidays. I was there for a lil over 3 months and it was crazy busy all day every day due to the holiday sales and closing sales. I didn’t like the fact that management no longer cared due to the closing. They let everything and anything fly. Cashiers would come in whenever they wanted they would get off there registers and jus randomly walk the floors even though it was crazy busy. Management was barely on the floor to help out. They had customer service run everything even though they were busy themselves you had to wait long periods of time to get change for your register, a void and it would cause customers to freak out. When there was no price they would say I don’t know and not even try to find a price or even get someone to find the price which made my blood boil (laziness) . The pay was only minimum wage which sucked big time when your on the register from the time u get in til the time u leave n other ppl are doing whatever they want and getting paid the same. Customers weren’t that bad they had regulars who would come in daily and actually respect u, but there were definitely some not so good ppl. If the store wasn’t closing and they didn’t bring in so many seasonal workers I think it would have been a better experience. There were associates that have been there forever and you could tell they loved there job and would go above and beyond. The place was more dirty then other places I worked. The whole time there I never saw the floors moped the break room, refrigerator and"
bad,"Company went out of business. It was stressful, no training. No communication with management staff. Not team players. Bad benefits, low pay. Long hours."
bad,The employees and managers at this establishment are very rude and discrimination based. I did not have a positive working experience here in the slightest.
bad,did not really like this job. It was highly competitive and shady. If you are into sales then this might work for you. the metrics were just a lot to obtain overall
bad,"A workday could be quiet or frenzied, and could change in moments!"
bad,"This place is cut throat.  They give you minimum training at best.  You may often work in undesirable neighborhoods, as well as the filthy living conditions some people live in.  You also run the risk of getting seriously hurt due to lack of training."
bad,Good work environment slow placed job because it was going out of buisness and not enough hours to work to keep a steady paycheck to keep going in the workplace.
bad,No drive to get sales up & no support from management. Hard to see eye to eye with other workers that are comfortable where they are. no place for growth.
bad,I enjoyed stocking at sears. Most of the people had worked there for  a long time and was just there to make a pay check. Really did not care to much about the job .
bad,First ten years were great and fun. The last couple though were nothing but a numbers game to managers. Turn around was tough and we often ended up having to do the jobs of two or three people for the same amount of pay and with less hours.
bad,"In the 11 years i spent at Sears there were challenges that were both external and internal.  "
bad,"The employee discount was totally removed due to Sears decline ,,They also cut our commision in half....The stress of being short staffed daily showed up in employee moral, Now they are bankrupted...I still stop by to check i with my former co-workers"
bad,On a typical day at work I learn to handle customer issues that may arise on the sales floor the best way possible. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help everyone
bad,"lack of ethical work behavior and every authority figure did not show "
bad,"Hectic"
bad,My direct Lead was super cool and never made thing at work stressful at work. Now his boss on the other hand would give me attitude all the time. She definately was taking full advantage of the fact her friend who was already a manager got her the job. It was lots of workplace favoritism going on in that place.
bad,"A typical day began with clocking in and seeing who you would be paired with. Based upon the day of the week determined if one would have to pull out the rollers to unload the freight truck that day. The workplace was pleasant depending on who you encountered, most were cordial. The hardest part of the job was managing with low salaries. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that worked there and the competitiveness among staff."
bad,"I worked as a repair technician for sears working from a van , Main focus of my job was to repair, refrigerators, freezers, in customers home from anywhere in the metro Atlanta Area. Poor Management, parts stock programs for the vans for horrible, loss time efficiency looking for parts and scheduling customers was a nightmare"
bad,"The store is usually super empty so imagine straightening the same section of clothing for 5+ hours. You can only keep this job by hitting a certain level of goals. There's 2 specifically: credit card and membership sign up. "
bad,This was always a great place to work until the death spiral began. This company has really struggled to provide for the associates who work here. Its too bad because this was a great job.
bad,Deberían de tratar mejor a los empleados no son robots
bad,"There are too many bosses and not enough workers. Management is a joke, training is a joke. There is definitely a reason so many sears stores are closing. I didn't even want to bother writing a review but this website wont let me skip."
bad,the in store manager was good but upper management appeared far removed from the day to day management of the stores. they seemed to be more concerned with making money and proper paper work than with customer service
bad,"Maybe it was just my sears but I was miserable from the minute I clocked in until I clocked out. The management was the WORST. The only thing that kept me going were my clients. If I opened one morning (rarely did they let me open) the morning meeting would just be the store manager and assistant store manager yelling at us about sales. Compared to most sears in our district we had the most traffic but it was never enough. Management stressed on the sears credit card more than anything. The reason we changed cashiers so much was because in the 90 days you were hired, you had this high goal on how many credit card applications you have customers apply to pass your 90 day evaluation. Most people couldn’t and were let go. The holidays were awful they made us stay till 4am to clean the store. So say if I came in at 2pm, that was a 2pm till 4am (I kid you not). I was a part timer that they gave full time hours to, so I never receive benefits. (Pretty sure that wasn’t legal). The register was so outdated. When our management were let go and we had new managers, I told them the stories and even they couldn’t believe it. My sears closed down which I stayed for the liquidation and there final days opened, which was bittersweet.  The only good that came from working there was I had this work family who I still keep in contact with, also the work experience (honestly the awful experience made me stronger for the next job). But like I said from beginning maybe other sears had a different experience."
bad,"As an Assistant Store Mananger, their expectations are unrealistic, they make you work 10 hours or ore a day no regard to your family life. I put in over 70 hours a week during holidays and there is no appreciation to your hard work only criticism for what you didn't do perfectly. If you report your manager to HR nothing is done if they are liked by upper management. The only way to move up is to get in really well with regional managers. They treat their sales associates poorly as well."
bad,Sears Holdings was a great company in the past- the impending bankruptcy and financial struggles made the culture very difficult during my tenure while closing stores and laying off employees.
bad,My job isnt a bad job if you are just starting to get into the automotive industry. i have worked for the same company for almost 3 years and its not a bad company.
bad,"It was severely understaffed ,and hard to get promotions. It was also hard to get sales as the company struggled to attract customers, and didn't always have the products."
bad,"They keep you part time so you cant get benefits. keeps you right under 32 hours so you will never be considered fulltime.  its Retail so imagine holidays, they have no regard towards your family. Youre just a worker ant to them."
bad,"Company was decent about 8 years ago, but CEO has made poor choices over past 10 years.  Cutting commissions for sales people and combing job duties has created a negative work culture.  Employees are supposed to know how to do all job duties for example one job people need to know how work the backroom, stock the floor and merchandise in several areas, sell product, and cashier. Company cutting number of managers in stores."
bad,I worked for Sears a long time ago as one of the first female service writers in the southeast.  I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked for but there was little chance for advancement and better pay or hours.
bad,did a lot of work for little pay with commission.  not the best but a great experience.  I would do it again to learn what I learned.  fffaetatetawetwe
bad,"Sears was a competitive workplace. I worked on commission so getting my checks was competition in itself. Although I have superb customer service skills, you don’t always get those good sales."
bad,a customer would watch you fold a entire side of levis pants and mess it up. I have learned to stay calm during the work place nd everyone is going to do that. my manager would never try to work with my school schedule.the hardest part of the job was closing . the enjoyable was break.
bad,I really disliked working here. My coworkers were not friendly. The atmosphere was terrible. Management only insulted and reprimanded employees and forced credit card applications. Only worked there 3 months before being fed up and left.
bad,Company closed for business in 2014. Was not a good company at all they would treat you badly. Under paid associates. Would not recommend no one to work there. Even if they were still open for business
bad,"I worked here only for the season and left before the season was over.  Although the learning curve was challenging, overall it was a fun job.  I actually enjoyed the fast pace aspect of the work.  There is no long term prospect here.  Sears is on its way out.  I am not surprised though.  Their company culture is the same as all the other stores that have gone down.  Nevertheless, it was fun while it lasted."
bad,Sears is a dying company that refuses to adapt quickly in response to key markets. Customer service is one of the least important factors for Sears. Stores are ignored and the employees follow the leadership that is provided.
bad,Coworkers were great however company has been failing for many years. Raises were frozen for several years and pay was very low. Hours were very good overtime was not a regular occurring thing.
bad,"For the short time I worked there, the environment was toxic and not enjoyable. Was glad to leave this company. Was not happy when working there which affected my health."
bad,"When I first began my career in 1994, Sears was a great place to work.  Challenging assignments, training, great pay and benefits.  Over the last 5 years, due to business conditions, this had changed dramatically.  Basically all that is being done now is to 'keep the lights on'."
bad,"I mean, it Sears, what can we really expect? Manager of the Loss Prevention team was very fake. He would talk good to your face then trash you to other managers/employees behind your back."
bad,"Management was always a problem from the start, favoring those workers which were closer to management than those who were not. They cared about nothing except the amount of credit cards we can open. During the spring the store would get extremely hot and yet their heater was still on making working there so uncomfortable and even a few customers passed out."
bad,"Working here was okay at times, but I really didn’t like the way how the place was ran. Customers were rude and we had multiple scammers call us for money on gift cards."
bad,"Not enough hours. If they would stop splitting 40 hours between 3 people and give someone full time, the turn over would be far less. But they never ask if you even want their benefits which they don’t want to pay out, so nobody is offered full time. It should be against the law. Everyone is doing it in all fields of employment. It’s a travesty and a sore spot that we cannot pay our bills. No set days either. One 7 hour day one week, and three 4 hour days the next. Pathetic mentality, anti-employee, no real value of the employee. Corporate giant using people as saves to push their overpriced merchandise and sell you Visa cards so they get a kickback."
bad,"Very slow and laid back work. Little thinking involved to do the job. Lots of busy work just to seem like your doing something."
bad,"The store had very few days that are ""just like the others""  Some days involve conference calls, schedules, and process freight. Other days are non-stop retail adventures.   I have been a manager in the store through several different roles, and am often called on to help with situations throughout the store."
bad,This company is one of the worst places I have had the misfortune of working for. they're poorly organized and management treats employees as less than. This place is definitely not worth your time.
bad,workers were always stressed out. managers did not help workers. slow paced environment. customers did not always believe your opinion on your evaluation
bad,Tener cresimiento a cortó plazo aprendes a realizar distintas funciones de la tienda
bad,working at sears was a great job oppurtunity due to the face that it interacted me with all different kinds of people on a daily and taught me to use my interpersonal skills.
bad,"Its a good place to start, just to gain something for your resume. Not really my cup of tea for long term position but everyone is different. Maybe itll be better for you."
bad,"Overall, I did not like my time at Sears. We were always under employed, so I ended up having  to work by myself which was a stressful environment. The management was poor."
bad,the location that I worked for that is also closest to my house has closed their doors for business. not really sure if the company is slowly closing out completely. i can understand them closing their doors because they were not making enough profits. their merchandise and brands just wasn't keeping with trends. they didn't pay well either.
bad,Once was a great place to work with great benefits now its every man for himself. This is a company who truly hates its employees and customers. Everything now is about selling credit products and tricking customers in giving their personal information so that it can be sold.
bad,"sears is a good company don't get me wrong it is just the management in coral gables store that's really bad, they don't give you enought hours, the rate is very low."
bad,pay wasnt the greatest didnt like the shift offered wasnt flexibly with personal issues  .The benefits not worth it  we only made some money wasnt the greatest it was horrible the employee appreciation
bad,"the management was poor, the owners do not know what the managers are doing, or if they do they look the other way. The jabiz organization promises to promote from within but they never do"
bad,I've worked part time at Sears in the Lands' End shop for the past 8 years.  I enjoy the customers and love the product.  As I do not actually work for Sears - they sold Lands' End 3 years ago - my experience is different from that of regular Sears employees.  We have experienced typical retail turnover and generally pitch in to provide coverage as needed.
bad,Answer calls with customers requesting service on the appliances purchased from Sears. Contact techs with ETA for customers on date of service. Contacting customers on products and services.
bad,"My goal for the day was always make sure the customers were acknowledge ,  take care of their needs and make a sale."
bad,"semi good pay, the hours are there, not really about helping the customer, bed bugs was an issue their, to tight to buy new furniture, just tossed the bad furniture and cleaned the rest, dress code is a big joke, girls look like hookers and guys and there sagging pants"
bad,"I was hired as a cashier, but realty I was hired to pimp their three different types of credit because the company is surviving on their credit cards, not store sales.  I dreaded coming to work every day!"
bad,sears is a nice company for a kid cumming out of high school but not a grown man with kids we only get paid $8.50 a hr. not what i was expecting when the application said we can get up to $16.50 i think that was jus to get people in the door
bad,Very disorangized with schedule and my was never there so o always had to go to a dif manger in dif department to get answers and sometimes they didn't no the answer I was top salesman in the store and really did not get applauded for the achievment
bad,I would do many tasks on a daily basis and I really learned a lot! The co-workers were really nice and helpful. The hours were really flexible. There were never real problems.
bad,It was a horrible place to work. Management was forever telling you to do one thing and then turned around and would do the opposite of what they told you to do.
bad,typical day was just standing at the register waiting for a customer to walk in and answer phones. get credit card applications and make copy of keys.
bad,"constantly changing upper management, each coming with inconsistent expectation. Play a lot on favoritism. Very high turn over door to poor upper management and expectations for the compensation."
bad,Hardest part was full commission if you did not sell you basically did not make anything and the job was slower pace than usual not enough foot traffic causing for major time sitting down causing it to feel boring and slower than usual/
bad,"Working for Sears is your average call center job so expect a high turnover. Sears is Sales oriented and their minimum requirements are increasingly getting to become almost impossible to reach. They don’t care if you have a family life outside of work your schedule is based off of performance and they will hold you to it if you miss work for any reason expect points, I ended up in the hospital with proof and still got a write up for points."
bad,"I worked with many managers it was a very open door place, the dr was great. The hours were long and working alone you could never take a break. It was a great stepping stone"
bad,It was very stressful dealing with upper management because Sears outsource alot of services overseas to the Philippines. Sears streamlined their business.
bad,"The company is struggling financially.  Regardless all the efforts the company have tried in the recently years, the turnaround is unlikely to happen."
bad,You have to leave your house by 7:30 am in the morning and your time didn't start until 8 am or when you got to your first stop. Then in the evening when you start home the last 30 minutes of your drive was off the clock. You have to take a 30 minute lunch or get written up. If you work through your lunch you got written up and lost the 30 minutes anyway. That is 1 and half hours a day lost on the clock. That is 7.5 hours a week lost. Management was a joke at the end.
bad,"not a lot of customers, very little to no work hours, very little pay, not a steady job to work not even fit for a part time worker, predicted to eventually go out of business."
bad,"As a cashier your number one priority was to sell credit cards, even to people that obviously didnt want them or to people who were either too old or not fluent enough in english to fully understand whats going on, if you didnt sell the minimum number of credit cards you were reprimanded by the manager and got fired after a certain number of repremands, do not work here unless you have no other choice or are really good at being a sleezy salesman"
bad,Greet customers and display the features and benefits of products with intention to up sale. Always offer accessories to products and attach warranty.
bad,"Resets were poorly planned and would at times receive 10,000 signs when only 500 were needed to re-tag the floor. Management was sympathetic but had little to offer in terms of help."
bad,to top a lot of this job off the vision they had for the employees changed drastically day to day week to week poor management with a low sense of the word teamwork with a convoluted idea of sales overshadowing the team aspect of the job
bad,"No opportunity.  Management is usually under qualified, and there is high turnover and frequent commission changes.  See stock prices for current company stability."
bad,"I worked at Sears starting as a seasonal worker. After two seasons I went to regular part-time associate.  I then went on to become In Store Marketing Manager and later to become Lead over men's department.  I have seen numerous store managers come and go. However; two managers in particular are horrible to the employees that are not in ""their"" department and no matter how many times something is said....nothing is done. Glad to leave."
bad,"Buenas ventas, trabajo en equipo, muy buen trabajo"
bad,when I worked for Sear I only worked part time so min. wage was not a great place to work at.  Overall I did enjoy it I made some amazing friends and i liked the customer service.
bad,"Sears is a company that is going out of business for several reasons. The pay is low (7.75/hr for cashiers) and they want you to insist upon having people sign up for credit cards with absurd rates of interest. They promise that you'll get two dollars per credit application you get people to sign up for, but that's not true at all. You get a pat on the back, and an annoyed customer, is all. Moreover, the hours are painfully inconsistent, and that makes it a struggle to balance a life around working there. You're better off working at Staples or something. They pay more and your hours make more sense."
bad,I don't think management is always on the same path. Sometimes you get direction from one supervisor and then another comes along and states you should be doing something else.
bad,"I felt like I was just a number and could be easily replaced at anytime. I was required to train new employees, but was still only making minimum wage."
bad,"The management was not the most effective. The opportunities for advancement were very limited, and not really worth investing a lot of time in this company if one has high expectations, as the company will not be around for very long. The work was not difficult, but dealing with customers who were often disappointed by repair technicians who would perform sub-par work on appliances, and also canceled appointments or did not have enough time to complete all of their calls in a day, was not an easy task."
bad,"Working there was a mistake. It was the only place that would hire me at 17, but honestly I would have preferred no work in place of that experience. Sears was not a nurturing environment. Their lack of face to face training and only computer simulations left a cognitive rift in the abilities of the employees to function."
bad,"Company took more and more away from employees. The last 10 years was extremely stressful, never knowing if you were going to be cut. Many positions eliminated causing more & more work being put on you."
bad,"Too strict with punching in and out for lunch, had to be exactly on time not 30 seconds early or late. Management mainly stays in their offices and is hardly ever on the floor interacting with the employees."
bad,"While being an office associate at Sears was fairly easy, the amount of work you do for minimum wage is ridiculous. Every morning you came in at 7am and your first task was to go into the cash room and process the deposit from the night before. After that, you were to go to the printer, sort through the paperwork, distribute the mail, and enter the overs and shorts from the deposit into the computer system. On top of that, you were to maintain attendance, approve time off requests, manage employee files, answer the phone and take messages, and DO IT ALL IN 3 HOURS. Job schedule varied for me anywhere from 3 hours a week to 20 hours a week, there was no security, whereas my co-worker for the same position was working a continuous 40 hours a week. Not worth the time or struggle for a measly 8.05/hr."
bad,This job was not the best for me I made an attempt to try something new but in my opinion I personally was not interested working here. On the other hand staff were friendly.
bad,"this is a sinking ship, stay away far far away. The culture is one of will we have a job tomorrow? and due to the fear of that all aspects of management and employees are in a downward spiral, College classes will be taught using Sears in the future of what not to do"
bad,"Ambiente tóxico y pesado, mal pago, mal trato, malas prestaciones"
bad,I worked in the retail stores.  This company is dying. The are shutting down stores left and right.  The store I worked in went from a an over 15 million dollar store to now only 3 million.  The let go all of their salaried assistant managers at one point and made them re- apply for their jobs to get them at a lower salary.
bad,management cuts hours to lower payroll commission is eratic and not fairly managed between technicians would not work here again and would definitely not recommend
bad,"Giving assignments for the work day for appointment specialist and making sure they are following through. Making sure you are giving them a plan to achieve their expected metrics or higher. Calling upcoming appointments and qualifying them. Making sure markets metrics are in line. Communicating daily with sales management and office management."
bad,The job was easy but certain people were barely getting hours. Less than 16 a week. The equipment was all very old at the time and customers were always less than forgiving.
bad,"Normally not anything to do, due to slow customer traffic"
bad,Cut throat work culture
bad,Sears was a decent place to work.  The managers were generally helpful but overworked.  I would only recommend a part-time job to a person interested in employment at Sears.  Business is declining and unlikely ever to improve significantly.  The upper management and ownership of this company are thoroughly incompetent.  Most people who work there have not received a pay raise in over five years.  The store where I worked had not been significantly remodeled since 1999-2000-and for a department store that is a very long time!
bad,"It was a complete waste of my time and energy."
bad,Asks people to work long hours and with fewer coworkers.  Management was always changing.  Unable to find out about advancement.  In the end the store was closed and tore down.
bad,"Most of my time was spent making endless phone calls to clients to remind them about their appointments, or to let them know their pictures are in. Very little time was actually spent on photography."
bad,Sears is a company to work for if you are in between jobs. The pay is minimum and the hours can be either scarce or overwhelming. Moving up in the company can be tedious or non existent depending on your position.
bad,"Hard to advance, if not in the click will not get promoted. Management plays favoritism. You can work hard and meet all your goals and at the end of the year management will come up with a reason not to give you a raise."
bad,"Delivery issues, not paying vendors to insure deliveries. Lack of leadership. No way to resolve issues. Nothing to inspire customer to enter store. Drug and alcohol and drug use by employees was tolerated and ecouraged"
bad,"While there were of course good and bad qualities, Sears credit collections required unobtainable goals for the majority of collections agents.  The upper level  management did not take into consideration aspects that affect work performance that are outside of the agents control when setting required goals from month to month."
bad,"worked about 16 hours daily, including coming in on my days off. they never put me in the system so I couldn't log into anything but still expected me to know when they had changed my schedule on the fly in the middle of a work week. Manager was great, other managers not so much. I enjoyed working there but was actually losing money daily somehow I was being paid less than it cost to drive there and eat lunch every day."
bad,"My very first day on floor as a cashier, I was shadowing and it was a bad experience because one of the employee made me do things I was unsure of and was angry at me which was not my fault. I did enjoy it at some point but overall, it was just stressful and being a cashier is not my desire career I would like to achieve in the future. The managers there were okay, but the management was not as good as I expected.  The store was slowly running out of business as well so it was hard to get more hours that I needed."
bad,"Great people to work for at store level, upper management was awful the way they treated the sears employees and ran the company into the group. Sears lost all credibility"
bad,"Sears is not a great place to work. The workers are not friendly at all. One day, they can be nice, but the next day you show up, they give you a dirty look. "
bad,"This was my fist job ever, I was only seventeen years old and I just wanted to make money and Sears was the first one to give me an interview. I worked in the shoe department, it was 3.50 an hour plus commission. For a decent paycheck, I'd have to work almost fourty hours which was impossible due to being a high school student at the time. The one thing that I did like was the discount when they had it for their employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with under staffing, I would work six hours alone dealing with customers, as well as cleaning the floor, setting up displays and dealing with our back room where all shoes were stored. One thing I can say because of all the things I dealt with at Sears, I got a good work ethic to multitask a lot within a few hours."
bad,Great training but low pay. Items stolen out of coat pockets and lunch stolen out of fridge. Constantly felt like I was being docked for having to go to the bathroom. Some really great coworkers just some bad apples
bad,Sears has filed for bankruptcy and it's out of operations. Sears was good place to work several years ago. Sears made a number of bad decisions which resutled in the closure of the business.
bad,Closing all stores due to poor structure in top positions of Head office. Sad that they could not make sound decisions on direction of company. CEO should have been replaced long before this end.
bad,"Not a great place to work, low pay no benefits, if you don't meet sales quota they will fire you in a heart beat. Overall no pros unless you really need a job at minimum wage"
bad,"Management at Sears pushed for sales too much to the point where if you don't sell enough, you get less hours. I didn't have any hours for three months straight."
bad,Sears was not a good place to work. I did pick up experience with sales and then i was transferred to loss prevention which i liked more. Management wasn't the best here.
bad,"If you know a lot about TVs and worked a lot of hours, you could make a lot of commission dollars. Too bad the middle management had no power to do anything and were the laziest employees."
bad,"I worked with great people at this store. I thought the management team worked well together and I feel that the majority of the staff thought the management team was a great group of people to work with. Unfortunately this store closed. I moved from another state for the upper management position. After working at the store for 3 months, I was told that the store would be closing."
bad,I was only working here part time while I was in school. The work environment was very preschool. Management  could have done a better at recognizing employee talent.
bad,"The only thing to be found enjoyable about working for this company was the co-workers. Due to the revolving door employment people who chose to stay there for longer than 2 weeks would often get beat down with inconsistent schedules and found it impossible to live their lives outside of the workplace. With the reports of the Sears falling and their stores closing it was nearly impossible to process a transaction without being trash-talked by the customers and hearing the ever frequent statements ""no wonder Sears is closing"" and ""so when is this store going to close?"". So if you want to work in a positive work environment where it is possible to have some kind of life outside of work, Sears is not the place for you."
bad,"Sears was going downhill when first getting there and did nothing but decline the entire time of employment. Even though promised getting to move up, completing online courses, and constant pressure to get sent to classes, they were canceled the week of. They don’t care about their employees nor what they do after shutting down every store in Arkansas but about themselves and trying to keep the money they have."
bad,"The management was poor. The business was under staffed and corporate would not allow anymore employees to be hired. We were underpaid and the benefits were not good as well. Overall, i would not recommend Sears as a place to work."
bad,"Typical work days were long and during some periods, we worked 6 days a week.  Upper management was tough and not supportive of the staff.  Always loved my coworkers."
bad,Management turnover was huge. often changed from one department to another. salary to commission also after hire. lack of leadership was huge. poor human resource access.
bad,"A hard to work for a company that does not care about the lower in store employee's. Must come in early, stay late and there was no need for managers."
bad,I love the experience of working there with different people who I grew to love till this day. I loved helping people and getting them the items that they really desired.
bad,"it was only when needs t ofill in for other workers that never showed up, then they call me to go fill in with a promotional sign in the city to promote there closing out sale"
bad,"The in store management was fine, but those making the big decisions clearly don't have a clue. Pay is terrible and there is no drive to get customers to shop at Sears. There were many days where I didn't see a customer in 8 hours of work."
bad,"I worked here for a year, and they worked  with schedule but paying wast worth it. Maybe as your first job to get experience work. they do pay minimum wage but you can try to ask for better paying when your getting interview."
bad,I pursued this job and worked it as long  as I could. As a bill collector in inbound that was not the job I was wanting to have for the rest of my life.
bad,fast paced lack of management or leadership the leaders or managers that are good get stepped on and walked over while the others that do not do their jobs move on to get promoted
bad,i would be asked to come in on my day off and would come in and the place would be swamped with complaining customers and mismanagement of the inventory so i and the other staff would get confused as to what to do so mismanagement make disorganization.
bad,"Unfortunately the empire of Sears is not succeeding in the Market with the changing business world. They still offer great benefits to their employees, however, this is a stressful work environment since the finances of the company is failing."
bad,"Sears use to be awesome to work for but with the decreasing customer base, low sales, the closing of so many stores it's not the retail giant it once use to be."
bad,People were good but goals and processes were unclear and direction was not focused.  No work life balance as you were on call all hours store was opened
bad,"No room for advancement with year over year declining sales. New management comes in tries to save the world, never taking the time to understand the business and will not waiver from their original game plan. Frustrating for long time associates with good ideas that never get heard because no one is willing to fix the problems because it would take too long. Everyone comes in tries to make a quick impact and they fail over and over again."
bad,All the management cared about was reports.  That and convincing people to sign up for a  credit card. There is a lack of customer service and wanting to take care of people; how sears used to be and that is why it is going under
bad,"Varies a lot depending on the business unit, department and the manager you are working with. Overall, full of very smart people from who you can learn something everyday."
bad,Customer service and sales is a typical day.  I learned information on home appliances.  There is high turnover in management. It is challenging because sometimes sales can be slow.
bad,with inconsistent work hours and having very little opportunity for full time advancement sears outlet offers basic positions for commissioned competitive sales
bad,Not very good pay.  Increases are very small.  Managers overall were friendly and down to earth.  A lot of the stores have closed. There aren't any open in the Binghamton area anymore.
bad,Due to the poor profits this organization is making many difficult decisions that affect the day to day business. Resources are limited and products are limited. Shipping delays and transportation delivery schedules are also very poor.
bad,"Sales driven culture. Not a great experience. I would not recommend working there. I was offered a better position at another company."
bad,"I had a part time, hardest part was trying to convince customers in to buying the products. Had to sell lots of warranties or if not you 'd have a low check."
bad,Cómo trabajadora no recomiendo en lo más mínimo trabajar en una empresa asi
bad,"Lots of pressure at Sears, to push there credit cards, a fast paced environment which made the day go by very quickly. Dealt with all foams of payments. Staff was great to work with."
bad,"don't need 150 min. low salaries, great people. but hard to be motivated when the store manager is all talk but no action and has not garnered any respect from his employees"
bad,"No way of advancing and the pay was poor. No fulltime at all. There I helped customers on the register as well as with items. We had a time of 5 minutes to get customers orders to them. The store where I worked was the second best at helping, as well as online orders, in the entire country, all the Sears stores."
bad,"A typical work day at sears would be cashiering, folding clothes, zoning the store, providing customer service, ordering products for customers, and organizing the store accordingly."
bad,"Good job for a beginner looking for some cashiering experience; however, if you have experience, it is not used.  Not a lot of management involvement and lack of consistency."
bad,This my first job. I worked their from senior year all throughout college. The great part was how flexible they were. The bad part was the poor pay and poor management. Lastly there is no growth at all. No raises ever. No advancement. They are constantly deleting positions and demoting people. With the decline in retail I've seen Sears change so much for the worse.
bad,"a typical day involved going to work getting a area to work in and handling all of that area. This involved helping customers, restock, clean up, transactions and everything needed of you. i learned how to handle mean customers. the management was bad the manager of tools would say he is new to tools to customers as a excuse for almost any question and a person in tools was assigned as mattress lead over the lady in mattresses who had been there for 30+ years. hard part was our quotas we had a 1 out of 8 customers needed to apply and when in clothes and all they get is a 30% discount the first time it is hard"
bad,they need many improvement with pricing team. supervisors and management need to do better on helping associates gain more experience with retail. over all its a calm environment.
bad,"Left due to pay issues, but those were resolved after December 1, 2016 with the advent of overtime pay for salaried employees. Store manager great to work with but the District Manager is impossible to please and he is always negative"
bad,It was my first real job learn how to multi task read a manifest the pay was pretty good and had good benefit my supervisor was good the work load was steady
bad,This was a sales and customer service positions. The store closed down so there is not a lot to say about this employment experience. I felt like when the store finally did close most of the employees were out of work because the company only transferred who they wanted to other stores
bad,The wrong people in the wrong management positions. Nepotism and favoritism for promotions. Unqualified persons in senior positions. Lack of advancement opportunities.
bad,It was a nice job until they got knew store management then the store environment went under it used to be  a very relaxed and fun environment to be in
bad,I started temporary during the winter holidays. The environment was extremely stressful and unprofessional. No one was organized. You couldn't ask for help because there was no one to help guide you. They didn't provide benefits but discount.
bad,The high pressure to set appointments made it hard to earn any money.  After costumers were pressured to set an appointment they immediately cancelled.
bad,Sears is only to make some money.  There is no option for advancement.  This is only good for part time. It is very stressful because it is retail on the floor.
bad,Very poor upper management. during the time I was there we had 6 managers and all of them quit due to upper management. most days you are required to work alone and at times it can be very busy
bad,"No raises, slow on most days here, people are fun to work with. We get free lunches which is nice. We have a new leader who actually acknowledges us. It's a love hate relationship there."
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at Sears at all. There is not much i can say about it. It was a long time ago so the environment may have changed. The worst part about my experience was my supervisor and I am certain that she is gone.
bad,Good at first but it is hard to advance. If you do good you move up but the compensation gets worse. Too much emphasis on Home Warranty. Forced to sell products to clients that they don't need.
bad,Not financially stable always laying off and closing stores.  Does not know how to match with competition.   Needs better buyers and a better CEO.    Sears did better before merging with Kmart.
bad,business has slowed down for commission employees. A lot of micro managing from management made for morale to decrease.............................................
bad,"To be very honest, sears is ok. On a typical day I come in and open the registers and begin to fold and clean up, we cant stay where the registers are and that causes some problems when we don't see customers. its is a lot of walking throughout  the day. then you just clean and cashier the whole day. The hardest part of the job would be getting credit apps and trying to incorporate all the things they want you to do while you are ringing people up as quickly as possible. Management is ok but could be better, you have to check your schedule frequently because the can change it with out telling you and expect you to be there, the frequently schedule people when the cant come in and its a big problem. On top of every thing hours at the store are horrible they will give you three hours a week because the store isn't doing so hot in sales to just know that after training pay your hours will get cut drastically lastly we don't get a discount any more. they took it away and gave us points that put us down to the level of a customer."
bad,"always changing the direction, these changes would be not small changes. With poor communication from top to bottom things were hard to get things done. They created communication that wasn't needed i.e. conference calls"
bad,"As many are aware, Sears and Kmart are closing all around the nation. This should come to little surprise as they are not able to compete with other retail stores. Working there is a nightmare, since you are responsible of the poor management and failure of sears co. Managers are always breathing down your neck in order to push credit and make people sign up to their credit cards."
bad,Always worried if you're going to have a job the next day ... Split days off ... Always work open to close ... Pushing things on customers that they really don't need.
bad,"I don not like to speak ill of previous employers, perhaps other people had a different experience, therefore I reserve the right to discuss this employer."
bad,its a job. very repetitive. you must get people to open up credit cards. they go real hard with that. they also want you to get people to give them a 10 on reviews that they are allowed to do which is on their receipt.
bad,I'm just not happy with sears auto center and work very slowly down. but i learn some not all same basic. change oil and check batteries and ration tires
bad,Working for sears was a good experience. I worked with some professional people. Flexible schedule and hours. Management was good as well. No hot water in the bathrooms was something I did not like.
bad,"you work , they pay you. the pay wasn't good, but it was fun going to work. You only worked part-time for minimum wage. worked until the laid us off. the end"
bad,"Best part of working at sears has been the friendships developed with coworkers.  Its tight knit, most employees have been there in excess of 20 years.  Not much opportunity for advancement unfortunately and compensation is near the bottom for the industry."
bad,"I learned if the workplace be friendly I can get energy and then I can transfer my happy feels to customers so that will be awesome."
bad,Trabajar en una empresa de esa magnitud es estar ocupada todo el día
bad,Company continues to do lay-offs and is always restructuring internal teams. Unfortunately it is stressful and there is a lot of negativity and turnover.
bad,"Es una empresa noble, con buenas prestaciones pero es muy costoso el traslado para llegar de mi domicilio a mi empleo"
bad,Very slow paced day at work.  I learned about the tools needed to work on appliances and refrigerant certification.  Some supervisors should not be in place.  The workplace culture has very low morale.  Promotions given to undeserving associates.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with certain difficult personalities in the work environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is freedom in general.
bad,"It depends on the sears which you choose to work. The one in Northridge, CA has a horrible HR Team and the managers that would work upstairs were the worst managers ever."
bad,"Retail sales of home appliances, refrigerators, washing machines/dryers, tools, lawn tractors, exercise equipment, furniture, mattresses/bedding, ovens, ranges, small appliances, clothing, operated cash register. Sales of Sears appliance insurance, credit application sales of Sears Charge and Mastercard accounts."
bad,"Vicious cycle of low morale creating low productivity. Steaming from the lack of tools provided to stores, tools incremental to drive profitable sales"
bad,"The job as an appliance salesman was not easy, everyone expect you to know everything within 2 weeks of training. Expecting you to be professional while management is poor."
bad,Don't get paid enough very unorganized  management is poor was there for three year they do not do raises and they treat their employees and customers poorly
bad,Did not like working for them. They did not oay well and you had to do so much for what you were getting paid for. Only thing i like about it was my trainer.
bad,"Cultural changes after acquisition by Kmart. Integration and push for turnaround may have contributed to layoffs, resignations and successful Unionization efforts."
bad,"A typical day at work includes cleaning up which ever department they need me in, putting out new merchandise that comes in on the truck, hopping on a register when the cashiers need help."
bad,"Simply put, Sears is collapsing and I want no part of it anymore. Whatever you do, stay very far away from them. The only reason I'm still there is because I'm waiting on call backs from other shops. There is NO job security here. You've been warned."
bad,"Sears is a good company to work with especially if your part-time because their flexible if your a student. In addition, the staff is fairly nice and everyone gets along with one another. Plus, the job positions aren't hard at all"
bad,"The job consisted of letting clients know of the packages offered, making appointments,confirming appointments, taking the clients pictures, quickly editing and helping them choose the best images depending on what package was chosen, then proceeding with payment, letting clients know when their prints were in for pick up, calling old clients to increase clientele, handing out promotional material to potential clients when the studio was not busy, maintaining a clean work environment, sorting images alphabetically when they came into the studio, opening or closing the studio. Maintain communication with management."
bad,3 appointments a day within a 150 radius. never knew where you were going for the day until 7:30 am day of work. had no time to plan the day. I did have a terrific manager to work with which at least made it bearable . i was successful but the cancellations were the killer. the most enjoyable part was helping customers with their needs and fulfilling them.
bad,"moved departments every other month, pay rate stays the same or lowers, not very good on raises. work environment was OK because coworkers were pretty friendly."
bad,"good part time job, But if looking for high pay this is not the place for you. lots of down time since there really isnt much in store any longer. I dont have anything really bad to say about the store but i also dont have anything really good to say about them either. it was an ok job."
bad,"slow days and then slower days, not sure how long this location will last, staff from neighbouring stores come in to relax on the recliners during their breaks"
bad,I have learned a lot working at Sears. Sears never paid correct wages to their associates. Sears also didn't match any money for 401K for their associates.
bad,"When i first started it was a fun workplace but after February 2017, everybody's hours were cut and it became stressful thus leading to my exit from the company."
bad,Depending on which department you worked in there were different experiences. Some of the people worked with were nice and some not so social. Working in retail takes a certain type of person to be able to handle the type of customers that come in to shop.
bad,"Morale is low, job stability is not there. Learning a lot by having a lot thrown in your direction with little to no help. Layoffs and store closures are becoming more and more often"
bad,I enjoyed working for this company but was looking for something more challenging and a job that paid a little more. I worked on the signage team and liked it.
bad,"Worked for Seasrs for 5 years. Over those 5 years Ive seen them slowly guy their employees. Slashing commission to the point of not caring. Getting rid of employee discounts. Fire people for not opening enough credit cards. They are pretty good at working around busy schedules, they usually run a skeleton crew as is, you may be covering half the store one night because not enough people are scheduled. Enjoy people complaining ""Ive been standing here for 15 minutes and no help"" "
bad,Company is trying to survive difficult times and many changes are affecting underpaid employees....benefits are very limited including raises. I learned  how to became a great cashier. Hardest part of the job was Black Friday....the most enjoyable part of the job was the big sales with the friends and family discount.
bad,This place is good for young individuals or Home Appliance Associates. Everyone else should find a way to move along quickly. Managers seem to need more training then associates themselves thats if they are able to find a manager for your department the stores lack leadership.
bad,"Many Sears employees are long-time workers that have been there for a good while, and the company really does have a focus on customer service. Dealing with Sears from a customer perspective is a strange dichotomy between dealing with friendly associates at the store trying to help you as best they can; and constant run-ins with a corporate 'pass the buck' mentality where the situations local team members aren't allowed to deal with often simply never get solved. "
bad,"Everyday I would come in I was threatened with the loss of a job. For some ignorant reason. Terrible environment, terrible managers, and sub par pay for the stuff I have to put up with."
bad,"I started working at Sears for the holidays, and I worked as a cashier. I dealt with a lot of customer complaints and price adjustments and returns. During the holiday season, it was chaotic and very busy."
bad,"Overall, I can't say too many great things. But, it was not a terrible place. Sure being my first job I did not expect great pay, also a lot of work. Sears did not really offer many benefits. Also, they had no real culture during my time working there."
bad,"They didn't offer enough hours to make working there viable.  Also, staff gets cycled through pretty quickly.  I can say there are probably only 1 or 2 people that still work there that were there when I was.  Definitely not a long term job with any security."
bad,"Company works with you if you need days off. Management is easy to communicate with if unplanned activities come up and you need to leave work early, come in late, or miss the day entirely."
bad,If you love change daily this is the place for you. The company lacks focus of the big picture. Their direction  is all over the place. The have great people holding them up that are sadly under appreciated.
bad,"Co-workers were great, management was not. Very frustrating place to work, especially as a commission based worker. Does not give you the tools necessary to close sales, nor products that customers are looking for."
bad,"I worked only 8 -10 hrs wk. young people had more hrs. they were trained more then I. supervisor was rude and disrespectful to me, the head manager rude"
bad,"I did not like my hours consist on how many credit applications I could get, I personally don't like ask people to do credit application. the employees were great to work with. some managers not so much."
bad,"The workload is easy for anyone, the computers the associates use are always broken or slow, the break room is dull, hours are sparse or you won't get any at all, most of the things the store advertises is not in the store so be prepared to take the heat from the customers while the managers hide. Most of the time the registers break down so you will have to call the manager who will most likely never show up. Just be prepared to be all on your own."
bad,"Management wasn't great, culture was horrible. Work life balance was even worse. I would personally not working for this company. I got the experience I needed and moved on."
bad,"On your own all day so staying on task is important, I drive a few hundred miles every day to complete my service calls.  Its enjoyable  because I'm always meeting new people. Problem solving and mechanical skills are an absolute must in my line of work.  I repair a large variety of appliances and small engine power equipment so my day is always different."
bad,"A typical day at work is slow and there are hardly any major problems that arise during the day. I've learned that this is a fast pace environment and that people will challenge you on a daily basis. The management at Sears can be a bit difficult to works with at most times, but not terrible or impossible. The hardest part of the job is keeping up being called throughout various departments in the store while keeping u with your assignments for that day."
bad,"Started working here part time and liked it at 1st. In January right after Christmas they started cutting my hours little by little till I was no longer on the schedule but still employed. I am a single mother  working part time for minimum wage, I moved on from  that job as a shoe associate because waiting for two months to be placed back on the schedule was not worth waiting any longer. Sears has really bad corporate business decisions that do not evolve and are not for the good of the store or customers. They stick with old ideas which is why they are going out of business."
bad,Didn't feel anyone was really there to build an employee relationship and make a comfortable environment for me to work there. Managers were distance and had nasty attitudes.
bad,the management is terrible. you can not express your opinion with out being scolded. the front line employees were very friendly. the management not so much.
bad,"It was high stress.  No benefits.  Good customer interaction."
bad,"Environnement de travail moyen;"
bad,Day starts with a morning meeting. The store opens and we start the day. Ready to solve any customer particular need or problem whether if it is customer related.
bad,"Not a great place to work, you might get laid off with no severance, that was my experience working there after 3 years. other than that Sears is a crumbling company because of management and corporate."
bad,"The management was horrible. They expect you to do your work and everybody else's and to stay overtime with regular pay. Also they took away employee benefits because ""we had received too many""."
bad,"Nice to shop and work here. Great discounts, had benefits, low pay but promising. I do miss working for sears. If I can't make it in the medical field then I will go back to Sears."
bad,this is a failing company.corporate and management cannot save or run this company correctly. they are closing stores everywhere.i spent 2 months closeing the one i worked at. company half assed everything they attempted to accomplish.
bad,"One week I would get 8 hours, the next I would get 20. It would vary like that. Also minimal job stability. Their policy is ""always hiring always firing."" Good if you want to get a job quick, not good if you want to keep that job."
bad,Sears Holdings is far removed from the company that once prided itself as a Retail Juggernaut.  The company is swiftly tail spinning into bankruptcy and everyone is aware except the pilot.
bad,This company lacked proper leadership and clarity when it came down to their employees. Overall the company itself was fairly behind in technology and knowledge of current trends which is why the company is diminishing.
bad,"This was a typical retail environment, both good and bad as far as management competencies.  The best part of job was the many different cultures to learn from, the worst part was lack of core values from management."
bad,This job did not pay enough and the work never changed.  Management liked you to look a certain way.  The public was really excellent and smarts.  I could not depend on my hours and this was only a seasonal position.  I did not get an advancement and I would have liked one.
bad,I worked for Sears for about two years and I really felt that there was too much put on the cosmetic team. I loved working at Lancôme and did not like having to work in every other department.
bad,"Never again, I came in here with the expetations of being a cashier and maintaining a clean store while helping customers, Not having my hours cut back because my job security depended on who qualified for a credit card."
bad,With the current public known financial problems Sears is having... employee hours as well as the amount of employees on the clock at a time are being cut but the same workload needs to be done!
bad,atencion a clientes buen ambiente de trabajo buenas relaciones con compañeros
bad,"There really isn't much to say other than this was a retail position. I struggled to get management to understand that at the time, my schooling was more important to me, and they kept scheduling me when I had informed them (with plenty of time in advance) that I couldn't work."
bad,"My manager and team are great people to work for and with.  The financial state of the company is the problem which causes a ton of insecurity, rumors, and a poor work environment."
bad,"It was always fun working with the employees. The boss was okay, quite lazy, but okay. The wage is ridiculously low, I believe that if you are going to work for a company with commission, the wage should be higher on the off seasons. Six dollars is not enough for someone to live off of."
bad,"i worked here because my other job went out of business. i would not go back to that company at all. The staff was not that great, and everyone seem like they had something against each other"
bad,"Always worried that you will be laid off , continuous turn over, in all areas. At time I was their still struggling with K Mart and Sears as one company , only well performance was Lands end ,"
bad,Loaded truck with a forklift big quality control dock coordinator also supervisor with supervisor need help unloaded trucks also and  data entry and was on the  Safety Committee
bad,"Sears was a good working environment for me and I really enjoyed it. It is a little competitive, but it pushes you to try to do your best. The hardest part of the job were the registers, many times during a transaction our registers would freeze or shut down completely. As a seasonal employee I did not scheduled more that 5-10 hours a week. When it was time for me to find out if they were going to keep me or not, I heard nothing but my work account had gotten deleted meaning I wasn't able to see the schedule or get any information about my status as an employee."
bad,Divorcing the successful business of appliance repair from the other sears holdings businesses would only remove impediments to success for the most successful business in the franchise. Profit centers in the business should get all resources necessary to succeed. If you starve the profit centers you will turn them into cost centers.
bad,"The hours were flexible if you go to school"
bad,While working here i did not enjoy this job i enjoyed my team as a loss prevention agent but the managers where non professional and there was alot of in store relations do not recommend to any one
bad,Pretty slow days. Work isn't difficult. Customers are ok. Some well known brands can be found here as well as appliances. Might find a good sell on certain things for a family.
bad,"Sears company is closing down so there is no chance for advancement. It use to be a good company to work for but since they are closing, there is no chance to grow"
bad,The management in home office continually roll out different management structures that seem to include more and more man power reduction. Every year causing more and more job loss.
bad,"order drapes for customers, help customer with items that they can't find. Ring customers out. I put up drapers displays that came in.  I would put out back stock  as need."
bad,"Co-workers were the best part of working there."
bad,loved the co workers but company was doomed from the beginning. Too many poor executive decisions that cost customers to go elsewhere.
bad,Sears is a terrible company to work for.  There isn't much room for advancement and I only stayed working as long as I did because they were able to work with my school schedule
bad,"Little to no opportunity for advancement, low pay, difficult scheduling availability, and high turnover rate make it a difficult place to work as a new hire. However, I have been here three years and have formed fine working relationships"
bad,"liked the job, gave me an opportunity to learn rtu, boilers, air conditioning, but company was hard to work for because you had a hard time when it came to get parts you needed to do your job"
bad,"Very poorly managed. It would take many attempts to try to reach a manager for anything. A kind of hostile environment, no one seemed to want to help each other."
bad,The people are very nice but the management has no idea what they are doing. Who knows if they got their stuff together now.
bad,little to no training. could care less about the employees they will just replace them if they have to. other employees were nice and was about the only plus side of working there
bad,"A typical day at work is normally slow, not to much to do. I learn more customer service skills an organization skills each day to keep my work place clean and under control. I believe the management is tad unorganized because we have so many. It's starting to not be as diverse as it was when I first got hired however; the hardest part about the job is getting customers/loyal members to sign up for the sear card and sears mastercard because that's how we get bounces on our checks. Last but not lease the most enjoyable part of my job is the friendships i've made with mu peers and how much we get a long while of course keeping everything appropriate at the work place."
bad,This place was very unorganized. Managers didn't communicate well. Store was understaffed and I made little to nothing. You were threatened about meeting goals when there were clearly no customers in the store and the pay fluctuated constantly. The employees were aggressive as well. The entire top floor aside from kids clothing was base plus commission. Base was like $6.45 and commission was 2% of each product.
bad,"If you like to work 60-70 hours per week with out over time or flex days you will be happy.  Schedule changes literally with no notice.  Enjoyed the people I directly worked with, but upper management had lost any game plan for the future."
bad,the pay was good. work place alright. was a challenge at times. tiring at times. good for persons that's people friendly. a pain in the but at times. work day was long some times
bad,I worked as an Assistant manager for a year and a half and then was a Store manager for the rest of my 8 years with Sears Holding
bad,"Assisting customers and helping with cashiering. Stocking merchandise to floor and overseeing intimate apparel. Price changes, and assist with other departments."
bad,"I worked at Sears part time as a supplement for my clothing store that I was trying to keep open. The average day at Sears were long lines and not enough help. Everything can be done at one registrar. A purchase, return, payment of credit card, open up a credit card, lay-ways, and reduction price. Do do the many transactions that can be done with only one customer left shoppers displeased. I learned how to consider customers, pace oneself, and assistant coworkers in a timely fashion. To be honest, I learned how not to run a business with sears. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with my customers. The hardest part of my job was assisting all associates on one accord."
bad,"too many chiefs and not enough Indians set up so that tenor employees prevail not set up for new employees to succeed.A typical day starts with you scratching for sales in Home Appliances,not letting the customer choose just jumping on their back and being too pushy!"
bad,"Jewelry associate commission based, assisting customers identify and purchase products suiting their needs and preferences, offering advice, helping hesitate customers make a decision, closing sales, developing a trust relationship with the customer and paying close attention to their needs and wants."
bad,Sears is certainly not for anyone who just wants a retail job. You are entitled to be a salesman and know how to make sales. You are held responsible for receiving 15 sales in credit cards a shift regardless of how long or short your shift is. Sears is a great opportunity because they do offer long shifts and you can earn bonuses. Although the management is terrible and rude to their employees.
bad,"Many layoffs are on the horizon.  Therefore, the environment is very tense.  The company is also closing hundreds of retail locations and becoming less and less relevant as a retailer."
bad,"Poor Management, days at work were a drag, very poor wage for the amount of work that you consistently have to do.  Expectations are set a little to high"
bad,"I love the Sears brand and was very excited to work there, but it did not reach my expectations. Management is poor, from the corporate level all the way down to local management. Not a good place to work."
bad,Low morale for struggling company always understaffed. Retail environment with no advancement expectations. High cost benefits and never raises to be seen.
bad,Confrontational and not very supportive of employee;s at the store level. Store Manager was a tyrant and created unrealistic goals for me and created a tense and unfriendly environment. Operations manager was great to work with and very supportive but at times his hands were tied and could not go forward with new ideas.
bad,"Sears was a great place to work over 7 yrs. ago when I started there.  Since then the company has gone downhill.  They stopped giving performance raises years ago, they do promote from within so that is the only way to get a raise.  In the past 2 years they have restructured, eliminating positions and combining the jobs of what used to be four people into a job for one person, with no pay increase."
bad,"Working for this company was a learning experience. In my initial interview, I felt as if management really genuinely cared about the employees and staff. It seemed that once orientation was completed, I was thrown into the mix untrained and then expected to catch on in a reasonable pace. I learned how important a good, strong, and reliable management team is for a successful store, restaurant, or any establishment."
bad,"Poor run company who is selling off property to keep a float. "
bad,The team has absolutely no idea what they are doing. The focus is to please the CEO instead of offering products for the market.
bad,"Unload the truck  and tear all wrapping of and get ready to place on floor."
bad,They are commission base and it not a very good system they give you a base pay of 7.25 HR  when  you don't makes sales and  you're  payed but when you make sales they take back what gave  you from your sales
bad,"Working here was seriously all about credit cards, and your job really depended on credit cards. I dont really think this is the managers fault because usually corporate is stressing out over sales.. which i understand. But one thing that was very unprofessional was they just stopped putting me on the schedule and never got a phone call after that.Not even a sorry we have to let you go."
bad,Typical day was great. stocked shelves. assisted co workers with their work and they helped you with yours. never had a dull night working. all the co workers were very knowledgeable.
bad,"A typical day as an In-Home Tech begins with calling all customers on route prior to starting out. Giving prompt reliable diagnosis and customer service. Maintain work vehicle inventory and filings of receipts and moneys handled from calls each day."
bad,Sears is an alright place to work if you're just needing a part-time job to make ends meet. The management is fair but there is very little opportunity for advancement within the company unless you want to apply for a management position and there is a lot more pressure on management and commissioned sales people.
bad,Not a very desirable place to work. Employees are stressed out due to lack of people working at the facility. Employees are over worked and under pad. Expected to do things not listed in job description. Policies change every 30-60 days. They are a failing business that is desperately trying to stay relevant.
bad,"Being a cashier at Sears was thee most difficult position i have ever had. Huge language barrier, which led me to not meeting certain criteria for my jobs description. Colleague's were helpful, but had to maintain their position's and customer need's as well."
bad,"Sears Holdings Corporation is a good, fun, and very mundane work environment. Most people are nice and I can say that I sometimes enjoyed working there."
bad,"I was warned by a former employee that working for Sears might not be worth my sanity. I convinced myself that her negative experience would not be mine. Unfortunately, after just two weeks with the company I will be taking my last paycheck and running for the hills."
bad,"Sears is unfortunatly a companie that has not Evolved with the times. And is now hemmoraging from everywhere. "
bad,La mayoría de las áreas no dejan muchas comisiones y no todos se benefician en ventas nocturnas contadas las áreas en las cuales conviene trabajar ahí mucho personal para una área por eso no se ven las comisiones punto mal trabajo estuve 1/2 año y nomas no
bad,"stressful with little to no beneficial side. management not supportive, very pushy about their sears cards and will cut your hours depending on if you signed enough people up for them."
bad,Fun to be around home owners with life possibilities in making there carers a living in purchasing everyday needs
bad,"When a part-timer outsells all the rest of the full-time staff over black Friday weekend, and then gets axed on Monday because they didn't sell enough protection agreements, I think that says something about the working culture.  Other than that, working there was fairly enjoyable and both my co-workers and the majority of the customers that I encountered were nice."
bad,"co workers were basically what made the job fun.  no work life balance, too high of expectations with the amount of pay being given."
bad,"This is a commission only position. Not bad. However the leads are not the quality leads one would hope for. Most days, commissions will be $0-$80. On a good day (rare) $120-$200. On a great day (very rare) $200-$500."
bad,Not safe at all to work in the trucks..No one to watch over you...Hot in the trucks at all time & they try to rush you to do a truck in 2hrs
bad,"Management wasn't willing to work with anyone's schedule.  "
bad,It was a retail job where you provide customer service to all the clients who came in. Helping them find the right clothes for their body shape etc.
bad,"At sears our department was basically the kicking bag for all the other departments.  We unboxed and checked all the items before scanning them onto the shelves.  Some days other departments would be overloaded so we sent some people from our department to help.  The problem with that was we then didnt get our own work done.  Not once in the few years I worked there did any other department have a single person return the favour and help our department,  Sears is just horribly managed by managers that sit in their offices all day to chat with eachother.  They only surface from their office to tell someone off if they are below quota.  This quota of course never took into account if items were too large to do more than a few an hour.  So if you work here pray the forklift driver doesn't just give you all the sheet sets and 12 packs of shoes(12 shoe boxes only count as 1 item)."
bad,"The amount of work that is being done tied with the low compensation makes for an unhappy employee. I like my job for the most part and I love my co-workers, but there is just nothing that is keeping me here. The job I do just isn't fulfilling."
bad,"This company is hard to advance in, the problem is that they don't care about the employees anymore and it is more you feel like you are being set up for something."
bad,"I worked at Sears part time while in high school. This was my second job I had ever had, the people who worked there made the work environment very enjoyable."
bad,"L'établissement dans lequel je travaillais avais du mal à atteindre ses objectifs de vente. Les salaires et postes ont donc été coupés. Je pouvais ne pas avoir d'heures durant près de deux semaines, et soudainement faire presque 40h. L'emploi n'était pas stable. Je me suis vite retrouvé seul au service à la clientèle pour trois départements complets. Je devais entretenir mes départements, faire du remplissage, m'assurer d'aller voir les clients et en plus, j'avais un téléphone spécial puisque les appels reçus au service à la clientèle concernant mes départements m'étaient acheminés. Ma responsable de département était exemplaire, puis s'est fait transférer dans un nouveau département. Ma seconde passait la majorité de son temps dans son bureau, ou à discuter, et me laissait toute la charge de travail sur les épaules. On m'a même dit que mes départements n'avaient jamais été aussi beaux, mais que je devais faire ça ''moins propre, mais en faire plus''. Je devais aussi participer lorsque les départements changeaient complètement, tout en m'occuper des clients, tout en répondant au téléphone et durant une partie de mon expérience là-bas, nous devions aussi recevoir les palettes sur le plancher, déballer nous-même les produits, et ensuite les placer sur les étagères... Tout ça en continuant de faire les autres tâches citées plus haut. On me reprochais chaque fois que mes départements n'atteignaient pas les objectifs de vente et que je devais en plus harceler les clients pour des cartes de crédit, mais je n'avais pas le temps, et la clientèle était pratiquement inexistante la majorité"
bad,"Worked as a cashier for the 2015 Christmas season in the Lewisburg WV store. They expected you to work 6 hours with no break.  Even when you were scheduled for one you practically had to beg them for your turn to take a bathroom break.   This was my second and last time working for Kmart."
bad,"Could be a better place to work but the culture is like a click turn key set up. The new click/group(friends and family) replaces the old click just to repeat the same process over again. Rules are rules dependent on weather you are in the right click or not. Non friends beware, for the rules apply double for you. Its like a Soap Opera around there."
bad,"The company has been around for a long time, but their direction has gone from being a leader of retail and service and switched to:"
bad,"The work is challenging, sometimes rewarding, sometimes not so much.  Job security is none realistic, slow advancement, and no annual raises for cost of living expenses."
bad,Même si j'étais efficace dans mon travail. cette employeur exige beaucoup pour un salaire vraiment bas.
bad,"I believe Sears has a lot of growing to do internally, with tensions high and growth low the workplace was quite stressful. Only positive was the actually teamwork fellow coworkers had developed."
bad,"they give you 5 hrs. a week, 10 min breaks, and the security watch the employees more then the customers. Its creepy I felt like someone was always starring down my shirt."
bad,Long days with very little assistance from coworkers.  Learned about teamwork and safety practices and forklift driving.  Hardest part of the day was the end of the shift because many coworkers refused to do their jobs.
bad,Sears is a great place to learn customer service skills and problem solving in a retail setting. My personal experience is that it was not a job that you could support yourself or your family on. This would have to be a second job for extra money. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with and the customers you meet.
bad,Management was constantly changing. No fun. Easy job. Typical retail job. Received retail experience. Learned customer service.
bad,"I reccomend Sears to those who are looking to get their foot in the door for retail jobs, decent pay depending on the department you work in, and overall great associates to work with!"
bad,pretty much a typical retail cashier job. decent pay if you're fine with pushing credit on people for money. main downside is the not so good management and the stress about making your numbers.
bad,"Very old company, they tried to revamp it but it didn't really work out. Management were rude. AC did not work in the store during the peak of summer."
bad,assisted customers with purchases resolved problem and provided quality service organized merchandise for display and initial inventory assisted with store layout and setup floor plan
bad,"a typical day was answering calls from upset customers about late deliveries or damaged product. They offered lateral 'promotions' meaning, more work, same pay. Doesn't seem like anyone knows what they're doing over there."
bad,You will be going about your normal week and at the end of the week be layed off with no warning in advance because of cutbacks. Would not be surprised to see this place go out of business soon.
bad,"This job requires you to ""sell"" products to customers on top of them already making a purchase such as opening up a new credit card, you have to make a certain number a month in credit card numbers and if you don't it's frowned upon. In my opinion not good business to beg customers to open up a credit card if they do not wish too, especially if they are there to just by clothing, and other store goods."
bad,Compensation was a joke. Good people to work with. Lack of coordination from upper management. Never have product in store.
bad,"A company that is going out of business. They are too cheap when it comes to giving our raises and promotions, but expect its associates to work hard in exchange for little to nothing. They barely have any benefits. Stay away from them. If you need money and they're hiring, go for it, but don't stay long."
bad,"For the most part, it was not the worst place i have worked, its just the company policies and procedures that i did not always agree with. it seems like they are more concerned with credit, shop your way and other metrics than they were on just making the customer happy. they put to so much pressure on the associate to meet all these metric requirements, that you dont really have time to actually just help the customer buy their items and be on there way."
bad,first thing would be a meeting at 630. then we would go out inside and start plastic wrapping the boxes. didnt like the other workers they seemed really lazy and liked to slack off alot
bad,Working in Fine Jewelry was a exciting and fun job. It was very knowledgeable. There was times when it would be slow and there were not many customers at all .
bad,"New legal challenges form a slip and fall research project to preparing escrow agreement, closing documents, easements,  and amendments to leases."
bad,"sears use to be good as years passed employees got treated bad, cutting our comm. without notification,sales down very bad working same hours 7 years and every year salery went down .Managements answer was well than work more hours"
bad,"Working at Sears as a Customer Representative was a lot of found."
bad,I miss having my own private office to count all the money for every register. I learned a lot about how to run a cash room. The hardest part was not getting more money for handling the stores money. Management was horrible and inconsiderate.
bad,Very poor opportunities to advance.  Minimum benefit without job retirement options.  Currently there are no merit increase for salaried positions.  Poor work/life balance.
bad,"Typical day at work was being in department with a long line, only one register working and having to type in the item and department number for every item. I would have to call to the back many items that customers wanted off the floor, it would take at least 15 minutes to get it and the customer wouldn't want it by then. Many of the items on the floor was never in stock but on display on sale with none in back. When you need a manager swipe never could get one. They would lose many customers because of their lack of professionalism."
bad,"Sears is downsizing.  Cutting people in every facet of their services industry.  Home Improvement and Home Services have moved their corporate offices several times, changing management and business   culture trying to hang on to the viable pieces of business as their market share shrinks.  If you have less than 10-12 years with the company, you are considered an expendable asset at the very highest level."
bad,The people I worked with were very interesting and fun. Unfortunately I did not work there for long enough to get to learn more of the job.
bad,The Sears store I worked at had a very unorganized management team. Very short staffed in my department and depended on me to work all unfilled shifts. Did not treat employees right.
bad,"Not much to say about Sears. It was my very very first job and as a result, didn't have anything to compare it to. Nevertheless, as an 18 year old, I enjoyed and appreciated the experience."
bad,A lot of miscommunication happens at this place. No room for opportunities or growth. They don't give raises. The only good thing is that the manager is willing to work with my schedule and the store hours are not bad.
bad,"I don't wish to say harsh things about this company, but I didn't enjoy my time there.  The managements' belief systems didn't line up with my own."
bad,Not my favourite place. Not much room for career advancement and no set schedule with not even a days notice. Management was poor here too.
bad,"Kmart was a good experience for me and few people were nice but the store I worked at (Taft, CA) was filled with favoritism. Only few people got the opportunity to move up with the company. Mangers do not communicate with their employees at all and no feedback what so ever! I enjoyed working there and was thankful for my job but I would never work for another Kmart because management is very poor."
bad,This was a fine place to work. Room for growth but micromanagement is excessive. There was also room for overtime and great hours as well.
bad,"The type of work we conduct is tedious and research driven. We work in an environment where supervision is not particularly required and time management skills are essential. We get member's complaint cases directly from the CEO. We review the member's entire file and service experience. We determine why the member's complaint was escalated to the CEO level. We decipher the Root Cause of the member's complaint. We look for any deviations from the process, whether or not a process is in place that would've have aided our advisor in assisting our members more efficiently. If a process is not in place, we determine whether or not one needs to be implemented in order to provide our advisors with the necessary resources to fully address and resolve the member's issues/concerns. We review/monitor incoming and outgoing calls, emails, and documentation. We cover all lines of business within our company (i.e. Retail, Home Services, Installation, Auto, etc.) We compile a full report including all the defects and opportunities observed, and it is submitted to our CEO for review."
bad,It was an okay job for a young teenager. Good for most teens in high school or working through college. Good Staff and management and wonderful customers.
bad,"With any department at Sears, one of the most important things is getting people to apply for the Sears credit card. It is easier being in Lands' End because with us it seems they don't harp on individuals as much as long the department as a whole is doing well with credit apps. "
bad,This is a company  that does not know who its customers are. It has little concern for the people that work with them. The company is soon to be a part of retail history.
bad,"Sears is a good place to learn about the retail business, culture and bottom line. They are frequently hiring new employees and rarely hire full time employees. They have good lawn and garden section also appliances section."
bad,"The company was in turmoil, started to restructure, had to work and fell like it was a stable atmosphere."
bad,"not very efficient- we organized an employee club and got the office running more efficiently Did all balancing of bank deposits- worked with cashiers, scheduling, budgeting, etc."
bad,"I really don't remember to much about Sears, it's been over 15 years since I worked there, I know tho that I liked my daily work hours and the location of the store where I worked."
bad,"Everyday you are responsible for maintaining your metrics, which consists of signing people up for the rewards, pushing credit card applications, and attaining members emails for receipts. If you are not above a certain goal per day, the management will see to it that you are aware how low your metrics are and will let you know every single way to get it up. Getting all this information from members is extremely difficult due to privacy issues, no email address or social security number, or plain unwillingness. Due to all these issues, maintaining metrics is difficult and having this stress everyday creates a tense and oftentimes hostile work environment, between workers and the management and also between the members and employees. Employees are also expected to be at 100% in their member feedback, which is either a nine or a ten rating. Working under such tense and uncomfortable atmospheres, creating a memorable rating with the member. It's hard to make a great check out experience while the member is annoyed with you!"
bad,"As sales decreased, more preasure was added from the top down and that made it hard due to the corporate situation out of our control"
bad,"didn't get paid enough for the job ! made employees do things that aren't part of the job. management was terrible , co-workers were rude"
bad,The only thing I miss is my co- workers. I go far in this job but they don't recognize the job of the employee. Bad hours. Bad salaries.
bad,"It's better than not having a job.  But upper management seems keen on finding problems or changing protocol at whim.  No raises, job on phones is extremely stressful, and the company cares more about saying all legal statements and selling new warranties, then for the customer satisfaction of current warranty holders.  The hardest part of my job was listening to customers that needed the companies help and telling them that there was nothing I could do for them.  The most enjoyable part was the few times that I could reach the appropriate departments and pull the strings to assist people in need of help."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but management of the store was extremely difficult, and unwilling to offer constructive criticism and feedback.  My direct managers were excellent."
bad,A typical day at work was an exhausting and relentless list of duties that was too much for the team in the time allotted. I learned how to work the cash register and how to use certain stocking tools and equipment. Management was tough and unforgiving while refusing to let us take our breaks. My coworkers were never in a good mood with all the stress they were under and how fatigued they had become. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up the store while making sure every customer was helped when they needed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was towards the end of the work days when things slowed down and we could catch up on all the cleaning and organizing for the next day.
bad,Management is very poor and not understand. Poor raises. No benefits.  The hours are ridiculous and you are constantly being told to do different things from different managers
bad,"A typical day at work you sit at your spot you're either signed and get on the phones as soon as your shift starts. any amount of time such as a minute after could result in write ups after 3 to 4 times. Talk to customers some nice most upset after being passed around many times till they get to you. Though it's not your department for you to deal with most issues that come in, expected to take ownership and solve the issues with on job training. When i say on job, i mean they teach you the program well but the experiences that come in fall outside your job so much you need to make your own calls to figure out the company and the way to handle every matter within the sears guidelines. This type of work style isn't for everyone many will quit the first month but if you make it past it you have what it takes."
bad,"serve great customer service. Make sure area is clean. "
bad,"Customer service"
bad,"The departments are always messy, no one does a great job at managing the departments. After closing down, made it difficult for people to look for a job."
bad,"the work envirnment was not always up to par  in OSHA standards, i didn't feel safe about working around leaking propanr forklifts as well as old discarded refrigerators that was retrieved form home that were filled with mold and other harmful toxins."
bad,"Upon the first week of employment I was approached by a secret shopper. Being a new employee, untrained and the shop being under staffed, individually by this secret shopper I received a less then stellar score which was then sent to the president of the company, I was then approached by human resources two weeks after the interaction with the secret shopper, repremanded, and let go from Sears Automotive with absolutely no warning."
bad,"Sears is constantly chasing their tail trying to analyze what went wrong but is not getting ahead of the problems so they so not occur in the first place."
bad,I would sale vacuum cleaners and microwaves. This position did not require any training. The information I learned came from reading the operations manuals for each new model of vacuum cleaner or microwave.
bad,"Extremely low pay, with little to no benefits. Management needs to be organized. No training whatsoever, also very disorganized. Work environment is fun and coworkers are very friendly."
bad,There many goals you have to meet while working at sears as a cashier or in sales. If your not making your goal the management will approach you rudely. If your making your goals its still not enough for them they will still approach you rudely to get more.
bad,"A busy day with lots of activities"
bad,Worked very hard and was not recognized for the effort.  No sense of team or community.  A very hard job and no effort to help with advancement.
bad,"A typical day at work with Sears is quite boring in most cases. Sears has a lot of online learning and training they use but its rare that I will actually get put on the training. There is never any time to do training so employees are on the sales floor as instructed, but its ultimately the employees fault says management that training gets overdue. Management is very tight-nit but they do not think highly of their employees. Management hires employees they intend to have for a short time to get work done but then fire or employees quit due to less hours and more employees, high turnover rates. My co-workers are close-nit. They all get along, but it always feels like its us against management. They all dread the hours and the minimum wage all employees work under. The hardest part of the job is the pay, I work as an MCA and I do everything on the sales floor. Pricing, labor, floor plans, cleaning: The MCA's are always on our feet and we are not appreciated for the things we do. Cashiers tend to feel the same way with management down their necks about getting people to apply for credit cards. They get $2-$4 per application. Sometimes the commission on the applications do not even come on their paychecks either. If you like working 15-30 hours for minimum wage a week, Sears will hire you."
bad,"The job itself promotes building a relationship with the buyer and having repeat customers. floor models are impossible to sell due to disorganization of manuals, remotes, ect. Commission percentages are extremely low. Demanded sales associates' quotas too high to achieve. Deep repercussions if not met, up to and including termination."
bad,"Low pay for work environment/duties. Large turnover, treated as a number not an individual. Only stayed to support family, and insurance."
bad,Nice people to work with but the pay is horrible. They do not give rasies at all and if they do it very small. For what you do you do not get paid at all for it. Only the big boys get rasies all the time and make great money.
bad,"•	Sales associate for sears for eight months and afterward I was transferred to a unload and cashier for more income. "
bad,"A typical day at Sears included tasks such as using a cash register, using a number identifier to clock in and out, and pushing credit card sales to customers who were not interested in opening credit cards."
bad,I worked for sears for 9 years i really dont have anything bad to say about them they are going though hard times however. i worked for 2 different stores/warehouse and they both closed as far as benefits go dont get your hopes up they under pay people in my 9 years i was only at 7.25 the whole time and the management positions are under paid poorly compared to some of the other retails. its not really there fault its only a matter of time before they go under its sad to say seeing all there history here in the usa.
bad,"The only positive thing about Sears is the staff on the floor and some Managers. As a F/T Associate or Manager you are expected to work long hours with no O/T Pay and there is too much work expected for too little staff. "
bad,"Store managers are usually fine, it's just the people below them who think just because they have fancy nametags and keys that they can treat cashiers any way they want. The pressure the put on you is too much and they try and hold you up to the standards of other employees. They badger and pester you and don't want to hear anything from you other than what they tell you."
bad,My time with Sears Canada was a very negative one.  The company culture was oppressive and expectations from Senior Management were unrealistic.
bad,Typically I am to prepare my department for store opening then attempt to sell electronics. My title suggests selling as my main responsibility but because of a lack of staffing I was responsible for a great deal of the merchandising of product within my department and others. I have improved my communication skills while working there and have developed quality relationships. Management has changed a great deal since I started. The current staff lacks tact for the most part and it is abundantly clear that we are employees for a corporation. The job is not difficult at all. The opportunity to meet new people is definitely the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Sears is an ok place to work for seasonal. The sears I worked for closed down shortly after the 2009-2010 season. All the management were nice.
bad,"As a high school student entering university, I did not enjoy my overall experience at sears. The co-workers we're so friendly and nice, yet the management at sears is very unorganized and pressure you to sign people up for Sears cards."
bad,"The customer service to the customer is compromised due to strong emphasis on employees getting customers to apply for credit. Customers that are new to the country are target for the high interest credit cards. The employees that are bilingual are the top performers. The number of hours an employee is scheduled to work is greatly depended upon credit applications obtains."
bad,worst job in my life stuck it out made some what a check do to lack of hours and pay rate of 8$ an hr with commission that was always return by customers daily
bad,"Recently all our overtime we were use to getting was cut out, and there has been little to no work for us which means vto being available."
bad,"it was fun, i loved learning how to work in the back room and all that goes into stock and inventory. it was different from any other job that i have ever done before"
bad,"Management sucks, they stay in the office all day and don't do anything. They complain all day about numbers but there is no one to sell to."
bad,"My co-workers were great; we were like family.  Other than that terrible place to work.  Management rotated frequently in the short time I was there, store was run terribly, we were always short-handed, we were never fully stocked with product, pay was terrible, and during the holidays when overtime was available; employees were scheduled unrealistic hours to meet unrealistic goals, minors were illegally scheduled past 10:00, even on school nights.  Good job if you're in high school or college and want to work part time & gain work experience."
bad,"Within any one store you could find an experienced and competent management team that leads the store to success. Not just sales, but great customer service too. Now the corporation as a whole is a different story. For years Sears has frozen raises, cancelled 401k matching contributions, even eliminated training hours in an effort to control costs. It has tried to turn around slumping sales with a convoluted rewards programs and other types of Hail Mary ideas. Sears will continue to underpay employees, under-invest in stores, and desperately ask every customer for all their private data until finally the sum of all top management's mistakes bring a 129 year old company to bankruptcy."
bad,"Company is nice to work for for a few months to a year, but limited opportunities for advancement and low compensation for duties makes this company hard to recommend."
bad,A typical day at Sears was taking pictures. I learned how to take good pictures. Management wasn't that great they were always getting someone new in. The hardest part was getting kids to sit sit for a long time
bad,"Je n'étais pas satisfait avec mon emploi ches sears"
bad,"It is immediately apparent why Sears struggles so hard when you start at the company. The company is a mixed-bag of relatively smart, ambitious college/mba graduates and lifetime Sears in employees with few in between. While there are some career Sears' employees who are sharp, they are few and far between. However, the ambitious newcomers are unable to have a large impact because the long-time employees often times resent them and don't make attempts to help them be successful."
bad,"When hired I thought this would be a great place to work. Training was done in a good amount of time, 6 weeks for most jobs there. There however is no security and no chance of ever getting a raise.. This is something they wont tell you until after hired. You are going to be the one getting yelled at by customers when you cant set a appointment to get a appliance fixed for usually 4 to 6 weeks"
bad,"Good for entry level,able to work and learn on many different cars. just recently has it received more organization. Good for first timer willing to learn."
bad,mangement unorganized and lack communication among themselves. staff lack motivation and guidance. very demanding work with lack of reasonable compensation. Wouldnt recommend job to anyone looking for full time work
bad,I worked on a busy street so the store always got plenty of traffic. I was never bored and I never had a dull day.
bad,"out of 1-10...........4 NO holidays with family, poorly staffed......high turnover rates......always."
bad,"Pay increases are not based on the overall job performance.  They are based solely on "
bad,"le salaire ne monte jamais, si un employe fait 30 ans dans la compagnie il ou elle sera paye le meme salair que celle qui a commencer sans experience il y a 4 jours"
bad,"Sales in tools,sporting,gardening departments and operated Kieosk, (Cashier machine) Performed Inventory counts and provided direct contact with customers and insured prompt delivery of ordered purchases of merchandise to customers. Assembled various  equipment, Treadmills, bikes, Propane Bar-b-ques, Lawnmower's. Knowledge of Electronic and hand tools."
bad,"Sears has no interest in a work/life bsalance and they discriminate against women when it comes to training made available for their managers.  In the 4 years I worked there, all male managers were sent for training, and none of the female managers were."
bad,Sears is a very good company to be associated with. They have very well made products that they sell and are top notch.
bad,"Each day you worked single coverage due to the low  amounts of customers. they did there best by trying to get you to work at different stores around the surrounding cities."
bad,"I worked for the company for 27 years. I was released in September 2014. Since then, several other long term managers have been released as well, my understanding is that the company is doing major cut backs."
bad,No pension plans and raises are minimal or not at all. everyone work very hard in pleasing all our members with all the problems of truck issues or vendor not living up to their promise dates for delivery.
bad,"They try to get you by telling you that the press is out to get Sears. However, there is nothing that I have found internally to indicate a turnaround. The CEO is not investing in the stores at all and assumes the online aspect and rewards program will save the company. When you say you work at Sears, everyone says, ""oh yea, I used to live by a Sears or Kmart, but they closed. Now I don't shop at Sears/Kmart."""
bad,"I like the job as I deal with customers on daily basis, listen to their problems, working on solving the issues, help them, trying to please them...."
bad,"Felt like I was on my own. No higher management back-up. If the store is not a top dollar performer, the store is just there."
bad,Assisted cliental of various departmental needs with purchases of cash/debit card transactions. Maintained by hourly cash drops and various quotas of the sears credit cards
bad,"Sadly this is a company gripped tight in a recession of sorts. The customers are wonderful, the associates do their best with what they are able to provide, as do the managers. The plan is there."
bad,"The home improvement divison is managed by screamers who demand more more more...offer zero in the way of support and you are held responsible for everything...If you are applying to be a project coordinator you will not like the job...they will pile everything on you...expect to drive your vehicle hundreds of miles per week, but only let you file a mileage expense once a month...NOT a positive working environment...its corp dribble at its very finest"
bad,Company is struggling and it shows. Needs to think more proactively and make its employees feel better.
bad,i really liked this job was very friendly i just had to move they worked with you if you didn't understand
bad,"I worked in the vacuum and microwave section, my job was to help customers with any questions or concerns with products that there interested in. Ring up any products that they would like to buy. I would say the hardest part of the job would be meeting the weekly quota. Its hard to sell vacuums and microwaves daily,"
bad,Great customers and friendly coworkers but sometimes work was slow
bad,Summer job as I was in college. Helped to pay the bills and I have no desire in sales and will not be going back.
bad,"Sears Holdings Corporation is the product of the purchase of two bankrupt retailers, Sears and Kmart, and merging them into one organization while still attempting to retain distinction between the two brands.  During the first decade following the merger, the company's performance has continued to spiral downward as stores are closed, staff is cut, and expenses are cut. Senior executives are overpaid while the company under performs.  Leaders are recruited and stay for one to three years before moving on or being replaced.  Profit goals are unrealistic and from an overarching organizational perspective, are never achieved.  Bonus structures are imbalanced and unfairly assigned among various business units.  Merit increases are virtually unheard of and if they are awarded, they're typically less than 1%.  There is no reward with lots of fake recognition for those who work hard to turn around business results.  Corporately, focus is placed on developing a loyalty program to reward shoppers for patronizing the brands, though enrollment in the program is overwhelmingly forced by the auto-enrollment of anyone who has ever had a Sears credit card, had work done at Sears Auto Center, is a member of the Craftsman Club, purchased an extended warranty, or had any merchandise delivered and/or installed.  The premise of building loyalty is lost and energy is spent attempting to inspire engagement among those enrolled, the vast majority of whom do not know they're enrolled or have no interest in being enrolled.  There is a forced culture focused on delivering ""wow"" member experiences, becoming"
bad,The work load was overwhelming Upper management never set clear directions for its workforce
bad,Everything was very tense. Did not like the experience in it.
bad,"You come in set yourself at any desk location. Start answering phones. How to handle rejection from Customers.Unprofessional managers. I really enjoyed my co-workers they all we're very helpful. Maintaining an impossible sales count everyday. Sears included wrong telephone numbers, multiple dead calls into the phone total per day. Best part of job was helping customers save money, and receive great customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work was not knowing when or if you would be conducting any consultations that day or not.  Schedules were ""handed out"" the day of so no one would know when or where they were working until approximately 9am that day.  I conducted in-home consultations for all exterior products including windows, doors and siding."
bad,"as an associate at this location, every time I needed help with customer issues or just have a question there is no one around. management are always on vacation or glued to the office or hanging out. and if you question any of the management that's it your on the red flag and any wrong move your out. also if your not friends with them there is no advancement. and if you are a friend you can move from department to department with an ease. without correct protocol."
bad,Approaching people and trying to get them to do a home improvement project is tough. You have to be tough as nails and have no fear of rejection. The more people you can greet increases your chances of getting people to book an in-home estimate.
bad,"worked here for 4 years and had a reat time, was assistant manager for the last 2"
bad,Decent place to work. Cashier job is super easy. Easy to get on.
bad,been in retail thirty years and have seen promotions based on clear favoritism with far less credentials.  have complained to director of human resources of entire company about--in some instances illegal hiring practices.  also at lower levels no cost of living increases--people off the street making same as other employees with good appraisals and service time.  mismanaged company.
bad,Days could be hectic at times and things seemed to always be unorganized. It seemed that management was never really sure of what the daily goals were. I think the most difficult part of the job was dealing with the lack of trained employees.
bad,"Perpetually broken equipment, Happy Talk from corporate instead of attempts to actually address morale (hint: wages). Good personality people worked there at the time, but I'm puzzled why in retrospect."
bad,"When I first started it was fine, but now all I want to do is quit. They expect you to make sears your top priority. They always threaten to write you up or fire you if you don't get enough credits. It's a good temp job but don't plan on staying here."
bad,Sears was a good company many years ago. Now they are ready to go out of business. Store looks old and outdated. Merchandise is nothing special. Many sections of store are bare or just extra merchandise Craftsman is all foreign made. Appliances are the only good thing about them.
bad,"This was my second time at sears (first time as a cashier in raleigh, nc). My first time at sears I had fun, only reason I had to leave was because of a new full time time and hour conflicts. ... no my second go round at sears was different... this was a part time job for me but they wanted to try to work me as a full timer...also, they expected me to work every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday knowing that I had also full time time job that I worked Monday through Friday..."
bad,"Part time good hours and flexible"
bad,"I lost this job because I did not sell enough credit cards; if it was a credit card company it would be fine, but it is a store.  I offered to each customer and I still get fired because they say no?!"
bad,"Extremely Unpredictable as to what's going on in the stores? HR is all lost as it's split between the US and INDIA where they have no clue what's going on here in the US. This is a system debacle that will erode the corporation from the inside out. Pushing my phone call to India where I get 0 help is a worthless, and moneyless venture for not just the corporation itself but for all stockholders, and much worse for the Employees ! Fired by corporate for returning from lunch after working three departments by yourself from 9:30 to 4 in the afternoon. Because A customer is upset that you weren't there 15 minutes earlier you are fired upon returning to work the next day. Is there a corporate entity at Sears that knows what's going on much less has a clue of Managements role in society? Better yet, Corporate cut the store hours of all employees and pulled employees from the store to move the upstairs downstairs. Same time period as when I was fired"
bad,Sears has given me the opportunity to grow and learn new skills that when I started I had no knowledge of.
bad,"Slow retailer which makes commision salesman struggle. Company operates on outdated systems, registers are over 30 years old. Always wondering when the next bankruptcy filing was coming."
bad,"Lack of any management intervention. You are on your own to work out any customer problems. Even when management causes the problem. Only busy months are May-July. You can make good money during this time. The rest of the year there is very little work. You get plenty of home time in the off months. Everyday your work load and start and end times are different. Management gives out the good leads to who they want. You annoy them, you will be in the slums estimating Air conditioning system in December with the outside temp being -4F with someone who could never pay for it, or plans on getting it. The estimate with no heat will be giving to there friends. You only get paid what you sell."
bad,"getting yelled at all the time was a blast. very little control over lab orders, and I was constantly being placed in one store one day and another store another day.  And getting the district manager to approve it took 3 months."
bad,"As a salaried manager at Sears you must anticipate having 0 work/life balance."
bad,very interesting job. very stuck in their systems and processes. Work days were OK. Some people felt happy and others weren't. Great learning experience that proves that change is necessary for sucess
bad,"-dusty trailers"
bad,"I loved worked at Sears. My first real job fresh out of high school. I love helping people, helping people find things they need. I loved working the register"
bad,Worked there for 20 plus years. Saw many changes. Company went down  when purchased by Eddie Lampert ( Kmart)
bad,"I have been out of work for months and when Sears called I thought I hit the jack pot. I am grateful for the opportunity but now that I have been here for a month I am obtaining a whole new out look that isn't as enthusiastic as it was when I was first hired. I mean can I just have a job that women can just come to work and spare their personal agendas and be professional. This includes the mostly female management team they have in Fayetteville, NC. There is a serious problem when you have a manager talking about her employees in front of customers and other female managers that prance around like they have a chip on their shoulder. Not to mention your hours get cut, and I mean seriously cut, if you do not solicit enough credit applications for them. This causes the highest credit solicitors to lie, fabricate, or cleverly pressure customers into applying for credit just for the expected credit performance percentage in order to keep their work hours, although they make it sound as though credit applications benefit you financially. I mean seriously all of this for $7.25 an hour. Training was awful because you are thrown to the wolves to learn the register on the second day of orientation, or observe individuals that don't take the time to train you on the register, or just the functionality of how things run around the store. They do not have people train you appropriately but the managers are quick to throw you under the bus and even in one case send a person home for not having complete knowledge on opening register procedures. Proper training seems to be hard to come by"
bad,"learning customer service"
bad,I love working with Sears but I would not stay longer than 5 years unless you want to become a manager/leader but even that would be too stressful.
bad,"Office assistant to Office Manager and Store Managers. Learned HR processes such as payroll, scheduling and the hiring process.  Cash office opening and closing.  Operator, Package Pickup, Signing and Credit services follow up.  Opening and closing store processes."
bad,"I worked there for 16 years and after yet another cultural change, things went south quickly.  Upper management just did not do their job, but took credit for anything anyone else did."
bad,"Great people to work with, but the company's C level management does not know what to do with the company."
bad,Employees treated poorly by management. No opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Everyone was friendly and hard working people."
bad,"No work life balance, people are not inspired by management rather threatened with termination in order to get things done"
bad,Got to meet new people.  Very enjoyable.  Pay was not very good and the manager at the time was not good at all.  Harrasement.
bad,"Sears is a great place to start out and learn about business and different skills that you can obtain, but overall is not the best place to work for. The pay is ridiculously low and their are no benefits since almost all positions are considered part time. They demand you to get so much out of a customer or ""members"" and if you do not beg the customer for the information than it counts against you. Many associates at Sears, including manager's, go against the rules and I feel like they have no ethics as far as customers go. I am a customer too, which is why I feel that they should be more ethically responsible when it comes to customers."
bad,"Gets pretty hectic. Quite a few of the employees were lazy so I would always have to pick up the slack, which i didn't mind very much because it got me more hours"
bad,none-i do not want to explain the faults of this company. I did not receive any owner or superintendent support for multi million dollar projects
bad,"Everything is cool. The people were cool, I enjoyed the work I did. My only knock on it was the pay besides that I liked it there."
bad,"Sears is a company with a lot of history behind it. Sadly, it's best days seem to be behind it as well. Local management and my co-workers are all wonderful people that I am proud to work with. Sadly, upper management seems very disconnected from the various stores, and there doesn't appear to be a cohesive strategy coming down from above. It's a very enjoyable job over all, and working with customers is both a challenge and a delight."
bad,Nice Place to work. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with orders picking.
bad,"I don't feel the company is customer oriented, or has the best interest for their customers"
bad,"Highly demanding job. Must keep a VERY open schedule as the work schedule may be posted as late as one day ahead! Will be required to lift as much as 120LBS unassisted. One team to handle every aspect of the backroom from inventory, unloading, and stocking, to online orders, merchandise carry-out, and general cleaning. Compensation is inadequate in comparison to the work-load."
bad,"j'aime l'équipe avec laquelle je travail. Par contre après le temps des fêtes, le nombre d'heures diminues énormément."
bad,"Loved the customer service and meeting new people.  The salary was only minimum wage, and several associates had been there for years, and did not advance.  The store had a lot of conflict among employees, and the drama was too much."
bad,felt like a slave when they had me on my hands and knees cleaning cloths racks....
bad,"Most of the sales were, of course, seasonal. If you have other priorities, like school, don't expect many hours. Also, had a hard time befriending others in the same department. Lastly, on-the-job training is tedious to get through."
bad,It wasn't a bad place to work but pay was a little lower since I was on commission and sold jewelry which was very difficult to get by but the company was alright and the people were great.
bad,Great coworkers. Quiet setting. Easy laid back place to work
bad,Its more of a retail store than a optical office management can be improved to provide better customer service.
bad,"open your station by counting registers, welcoming customers, signing customers of for shop your way rewards and sears store credit"
bad,My rypical dat began with delivery set up and teaching instrutions to patient who opted for home treat ment.I learn that at home treatment and support extents lives and mamanagement team of nurse supported it with ther love and commtiment.My co-worker were also hard worker.But limited .he ardest paet of that job was use od personal transprtation and being on call with help.Whe paatient jus say thank you
bad,A few members of management were great. Co-workers were friendly for the most part. It is a great feeling helping customers.
bad,My immediate co-workers were the only enjoyable part of this job. The corporate culture only cared about metrics and moving product off the floor. There was a complete lack of people-focused attitude at all levels of management. I was turned off so much by how employees are treated that I will never even shop there again.
bad,"A typical day of work consist of loading up freight from downstairs and bringing up into footwear stockroom. Assisting customer locating product and doing online orders for out of stock items."
bad,no comment enjoyed working for sears just wish there was more growth
bad,"A good place to work whenthe hours are consistant."
bad,"low pay, not enough to pay for benefits.  too much work for one person for only 7.25.  Management and employees gossip too much.  not consistent schedule.  35 hrs one week 10 hrs the next.  Would not work at sears."
bad,"training was quick, learned a lot about jewelry and how to deal with"
bad,I was sent to manage without proper training. When discussing with area manager was told I will figure it out.
bad,"I started this job when I was 16 and it was a great first experience.  I learned a lot of firsts at this job.  I was taught the rules of giving great guest service, how to properly straighten a sales floor, and how to use your down time wisely.  Management here was very pushy,  I was just a kid and they were not kind in the way they handled showing me how to meet a credit card sales goal.  And that was the hardest part of working there.  I loved my co-workers, I still talk to some of them now and they were the most enjoyable part of the work day.  The guests that came into our store were very courteous and helping them with their needs was a blast!"
bad,"recevoir et étiquetté la marchandise,chargé les vannes"
bad,Worked too hard for what I got paid. Did not get enough hours. The people were nice.
bad,Learning roller coster ride with management and customers every single day
bad,Worked as basic security for Sears corporation. watched cameras and did recon for shoplifters.
bad,Expectations include convincing people to go to places you know very little about - often less than the interested clients themselves.
bad,"Running a catalog office alone was very much fun.I did everything from receiving the shipments to handing out the parcels,balancing daily reports,returns."
bad,I have worked here for a couple years now. In the beginning it was good and then I started to notice that when it came time to switch departments management did the impossible to make excuses to keep you in that position . Here it doesn't matter if you do real good work or you're a hard worker management decides you're fate in the company.  And also when it comes to job opportunities they always hire outside of the company rather than giving current employees the opportunity to exceed.
bad,"Sales opportunities come and go, as with any commission based position. If business is good, pay is good. If business is bad, pay is poor. Corporation has instituted company wide raise freezes, which means no raise even after two years of exceeding every standard."
bad,Clean work environment and well trained managers were hard to find here.
bad,"descent pay to start. However, there has not been much room for advancement. There has been a freezer on raise for last 5 years. On top of that, raises on go up by 10 cent increments."
bad,"•Assist at POS and Customer Service."
bad,"The Store Manager seem desperate to find someone good. She even promised me I would become an Assistant Store Manager in no time. Over all the fastest interview process I have ever witnessed. Most companys take few weeks but if this company wants you bad they will rush ya in less then few days. Unloading two trucks a week with one other person sometimes on your own. It was appliances like washers, dryers, stoves and refrigerators. A lot of labor involved with this company. The computer system was so outdated. I was promised I would become an Assistant Store Manager in no time. I had years of retail management experience and felt downgraded with the Receiving Supervisor role which I wanted an Assistant Manager role that I could of had but the store 15miles away was to close and I know the store manager knew that and talked me into working for her. I met the District Manager once he was a really big guy didn't move that fast in the store. He didn't talk much to me as I wanted to chat about getting promoted. The starting pay would of been $10 to $12 and I got $12 only because I was making $20 before hand. Yeah the pay is really poor unless your the Store Manager. Word of advice have a real training program set in place with retail management experienced New Hires who want to be promoted knowing they will after a series of accomplishments staying on track learning the ropes. I had a week or two of training then left alone. How can I become an Assistant Store Manager without the tools and mentoring of the Store Manager who didn't work with me at all. She was the best Store Manager"
bad,"Cashier for Sears mostly in hardware department, was planning on moving to sales but never had a chance too while I was attending school. "
bad,It was a pleasure working for the Loss Prevention manager at the store. 
bad,"I spent 10 years woking for this company and they just laid me off.  It was an ok place to work, but the pay was horrible.  I don't know how I survived on what I was being paid for all my hard work."
bad,They wanted me to constantly miss school to come into work. We couldn't keep staff so it was constantly just the manager and I.
bad,cleaned up store helped guest didnt work there to long it was an okay job.
bad,The job requires too much and they dont pay enough for the services.
bad,Poor Management and thug co-workers made working at Sears a total drag.
bad,The management was crazy. Its an in-house company if that says more.
bad,"The job was seasonal. So, I mainly was over the perfume counter and down stocked a lot."
bad,When you become security it really tech you to look at every one and to imagine everything most of the job is done by CCTV and the rest is walked around as a plain clothed agent i learn that people will go threw the extremes to steal and theft doesn't have and age no day was ever the same 
bad,"Sears should focus more on allowing employees the opportunity to advance and also compensate faithful employees. The company is good with working with schedules,but they are very demanding when it comes to stats."
bad,"Management at Sears is one of the most loosely organized group I've ever worked for. If you weren't a manager you were treated as expendable with no real thanks given to the people who actually keep the store running. The hardest part of the job was the most important aspect of the job. Signing people up for Sears credit cards, quotas for credit card sign up's was to high to ever handle which always led to pressure from the store manager. "
bad,"I like the job itself. I don't mind the long hours, but I do mind how the employees are treated, over-worked for very little reward. "
bad,This was a good place to work. I learned how to deal with difficult people over phone. I had to dress business casual everyday which made me have a great attitude.
bad,"Boring, cashier, shipment, pricechanging,co workers are friendly"
bad,"the studio was always kept clean, the photographs came out great, the coworkers were friendly"
bad,"Kmart/Sears in Wellsville, NY was the WORST experience I have ever had. My husband is a soldier and when I needed time to go with hiim to do power of attorney things and ID cards they wouldn't give me the time. I told them I would have to take a day regardless (they have over two weeks notice) so they had various people write me up for wearing the ""wrong color pants"" during our uniform transition. They made it so that if I had to call off and take a half infraction I'd be fired instead. I'd never caused a problem or had to ask for time off in the 3 years I'd worked there. Never again."
bad,"The one positive about this job is the flexibility around class schedules, etc. During college this was a must. Many of the other employees are college students which makes the environment enjoyable too."
bad,A typical day at Sears in Warrenton was overall slow. I learned more about customer service and about the products Sears and Lands End
bad,"Management does not care for its employees. The proper equipment to do the jo is never provided. and if your hurt, they tell you to keep working."
bad,Terrible company. ....Took benefits away....Fired people for not opening enough credit cards
bad,"Interacted with customers and employees for sales, problems solving, approvals and locating of merchandise. Price set up, display set up, inventory, opening and closing of store, and coordinating / supervising of projects."
bad,Fast pace environment.Preasure to complete tasks with in deadlines set by the DM. Goals had to be maintained consistantly..
bad,lots of jobs lost due to a few locations shutting down. Very low staffed. No hours to give.
bad,I worked for the Unit 1674 from July 2007 to June 2012 as
bad,"The average day consisted of carrying out tasks assigned that needed get done that day. Usually notified of changes or new tasks at the last minute, which happened quickly, making completing them difficult. Tasks such as reorganizing and displaying merchandise to manager's liking, as well as keeping track of stock counts and values. It is a low level position and the co-workers are helpful and friendly. But the higher up the corporate ladder the communication and helpfulness and greatly decreases. Hardest part is working the job is during the holidays when it is near impossible to keep track of all the merchandise, as it is constantly changing locations. Most enjoyable part is working with the co-workers in the department."
bad,"Working at Sears is so competitive sometimes for no reason. I started at cashier and they want you to force credit apps on customers. I moved to Fine Jewelry were the force other metrics. I do like my co-workers but they've hired a lot of high schoolers during the holiday season. The one I work at particularly has a high turn over rate, the most enjoyable part is meeting nice customer and building relationships with repeat clientele."
bad,"Easy job, and that's why wages were low. Company doesn't give a flip about you, but expect you to be loyal to them"
bad,Did not understand the lives of people outside of work. Balance of life and employment were not respected.
bad,I loved working for this company but i had to move out of the city.
bad,The traning was excellent. I enjoyed talking with customers from different parts of the country.
bad,I like cloth and fashion so for me to help the costumer find something that they liked was rewarding for me.
bad,"the company does not care at all, management is not a professional bunch"
bad,"I learned alot of electrical, and appliance repairs, and was able to get my licenses through this company."
bad,The management needs to change in order for this specific store to be successful. Little to no duties to do on a slow day and when you try to utilize what you learn from a university it is immediately shut down. Employees are given no voice and are just considered numbers to the head manager.
bad,"Sears Holding Corp (Kmart and Sears) has some very good policies, especially with what I experienced in the area of Loss Prevention. Specifically, Sears is a ""hands off"" company that requires an LP associate to gather a lot of proof before attempting a stop. I haven't heard of many ""bad stops"" because of this."
bad,"Depending on the management there, the day can vary. I used to have a set agenda but toward the end I had to wait to do whatever the manager wanted me to do. I learned how to be resourceful with the tools I had. Each manager had their own style and it was at times difficult to please them, especially when they all liked to be catered to. Most of the coworkers tried their best to ensure the task got done but very few cared about their job. The hardest part was trying to get the task done with what little resources we had, and doing it by myself. I enjoyed the few coworkers that have been working there for a while, we made the work environment enjoyable."
bad,"Sears is not a good company to work, the management treats their employees like they don't belong there"
bad,Coworkers were friendly. The management did not seem to be able to motivate the employees. Schedule was easy.
bad,Low pay for all the work you have to do but great for a high schooler
bad,A typical day at work ususally involves the following in any given order:
bad,Customer Service is really lacking from call centers. Call centers hang up on customers tell them they dont know what their talking about and can't understand them>
bad,No sound structure at the store level. To many managers and no clear leadership.
bad,"Loved the co workers but you can force a customer to buy somthing for 3,000.00 if they can pay for it"
bad,"Average 900 miles per week driving. They send you on any lead even if all decision makers are not present. Top 10% of 200 employees in the western region make $83,000 per year. 90% are making a lot less."
bad,My experience there was ok if only the regular employees were all i talked about..the managers were so-so but as always one apple ruins it for the bunch
bad,"Took physical inventory of floor displays, restocked from warehouse."
bad,I enjoyed Sears for the people I worked with but I unfortunately found corporate direction made it a place I did not want to continue working for. Store level on a whole was good but the company's overall direction is not satisfactory.
bad,"The general idea here is if you like to work on vehicles this is a good job. Management started off great changed hands and the whole operation went south. There was a loss of business and a major loss in hours. Going above and beyond the call of duty went nowhere but south. So best advise, keep your head down, do your work and go home at the end of your shift."
bad,"I learned a lot about retail starting with the inventory , customer service and stock"
bad,Sears employed me over 10yrs. For this I am thankful. Working for Sears was my experience into the customer service world. Making customers happy are the ultimate prize for the day.
bad,"I had a bad experience with them because i was sent to work to Haiti and i had no accommodations whatsoever to do my job accordingly. Had to be at the factories for about 6 to 7 days a week. Plus they did not offer me any benefits at all. It was just a paycheck every month and i just had to make sure that the work was done on time, otherwise i'd be getting yield at and/ or pressured if something was not done accordingly. The only time I had some sort of relief was when my supervisor came to check on me in Haiti and that was every other month."
bad,"No set hours, very low pay for duties performed. All in all it is something to get me to the next part of my life."
bad,Company is struggling in sales. The commission rates have changed more in the last 6 months then in the last 3 years. Selling anything that isn't Kenmore brands results in less change in your pockets. Other employees eager to take the sale. If you can't sell the warranty you can lose your job
bad,it was ok and dont kno what else to say and that it so what can i say
bad,"When i first started working at Sears,I had to do alot of training.As i went on working there alot of things were coming easier,Some of my co workers were helpful.some of them were not.I loved the job but not the requirements that came with the position I loved the people i worker with,I worked there for 10 months.I thought i was doing well at somethings and some points i needed extra help.But i feel i tried by best."
bad,Pulled stock and distribute inventory into departments
bad,Sears was pretty decent job overall. No complaints.
bad,"The pay was excellent, but the hours that were required and the on call was not good at all because there was only 4 of us that made the on call rotation."
bad,* Typical Day: Open cash register; Help customers with product knowledge; help out in other departments; assist customers on the floor; clean fitting rooms; answer phone calls; record transactions; close cash register.
bad,Typical Day: 10-14 hour days manage 98 associates; from Logistics to customer service.
bad,"A typical work day for me is coming in to smiling welcoming faces, starting my day with ordering new stock, bringing out new receipts to the floor, and helping customers make decisions with their purchases"
bad,"Sears is an okay place to work. The people are nice and the customers are friendly. The only negative thing is hours. Everyone is part time. Most people get 20 hours or less. If you're a high school student or a person with no bills, this is the perfect place for you, If not, please work somewhere else."
bad,"When I started, they expressed the need for positivity, to flourish to your maximum potential, and the necessity for advancement."
bad,was young need a job that's all i have to say about it. ok mangement made some friends. it was ok.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. Management was not good. I loved my co-workers! Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers and supervisors.
bad,"A typical is when customers come in and buy home appliances for there house like washer, dryer, and more. I learned that you will deal with all types of people but all you can do is be nice to them and have a smile on your face even if they're saying disrepectful things. Management was low some co-workers was doing the management job because they wasn't doing it right. The hardest about that job is we work on commision so if there is nobody coming in that day you don't get paid for that day. the most enjoyable part of the job when we don't have customers calling in and yelling at us because of delivery."
bad,"I can not sell a customer something they do not need. At the end of the day the only thing I have is my reputation. I will not sell a high pressure pitch, or useless item just to get a sale. Its not worth it"
bad,"The store i worked at was never busy, there was always downtime and it was hard to find things to stay busy. Managers there were always standoffish and not very approachable."
bad,"Duties: which included but not limited to, maintaining a cheerful attitude an a approachable look towards clients and customers, issue receipt , refunds, credits, or change due to customers, maintain an clean and orderly checkout area, and answer customers questions, and provide information on policies or procedures."
bad,easy work and good pay good employees very nicee understanding managers
bad,"The job is fairly easy as long as you can deal with the customers that come to pick up their items. If you need time off for something they are usually pretty good with that. As far as pay/raises go, the store gets graded as a whole so if the store does bad no one gets raises which is bad because they get graded yearly."
bad,"While working for Sears Holdings, it wasn't a horrible experience as I was there for almost 2 years. However they went from a focus on customer service & customer support to adding more strict metrics. When I left they end spent more time policing their department's metrics wise then they did on training employees on how the metrics worked (as every team-manager would tell you a different method on how said metrics worked)as well as training on new appliances."
bad,"I worked at sears & roebuck from 2004-2005 It was a good experience as it was my first job and I learnt a lot of things from sears. Although the pay was not to much but the experience was very well structured I learnt how to work in a small time frame, dealt with many customers."
bad,"Not much room for advancement, too political, poor pay and benifits."
bad,Sears is now closed. An iconic company and employer in canada that truly just was outdated by newer ways to do business. The management sy=tyle was outdated and they felt employees were lucky to have a job. Today employers of choice treat their employees as a valued treasure....with sears that was not the case
bad,I worked at Sears for 4 years. I was passed up on multiple promotions because there was heavy favoritism with in the company. It was to the point where I was training my managers. For about 6 months I was the person everyone went to for everything. I talked to the district manager explaining this to him and I only received a .20 cent raise. The company does not care for their employees.
bad,Not the best place to work at. They do not ttreat there imployeez well and they are not orgonized. Sears managment was rude and not helpful while i was employed
bad,"The training is Terrible you basically learn something new everyday. Management gets mad if you don’t know something but that’s not your fault cause like I said you basically learn something new everyday. They don’t care who they scam into a credit card as long as they get people to Apply. Job was ok! There understanding of me being pregnant and giving a week notice like they asked for appointments still wasn’t enough they were still rude about it  worst job to work for Tucson AZ, SEARS!!!"
bad,They were judgemental there if you didn't wear the clothes that they think you should. They judge you with out even knowing you. They had good benefits.
bad,It wasn’t a bad place to work. Lots of VTO so you can take time off to do what you need to do. The “going out of business” scare really did it for me to be honest. They wouldn’t tell us what was happening and I didn’t like that at all.
bad,"Safe and fast-paced workplace, Learned to ship online orders through UPS as well as learn to use the UPS shipping app. Most enjoyable part was working with and learning with great employees."
bad,"SEARS allows for one to learn a lot about the sales industry. However, the current model for sale associates relies on commissions and pushing the SEARS credit card outside of the normal sales activities."
bad,"It was ok everyone was kinda rude they blame people for things they did and they would talk about customers and not do want to help do discounts costumers ,"
bad,"Except for the palpable sense of existential doom that seem ubiquitous in this twilight era of our economic system - especially thick in the ""oh-god-we-are-going-bankrupt"" environment of Sears - this is a generic retail job. It is mostly boring, punctuated by the stupidity of customers and the laziness of management. Don't do merchandise pick-up, or warehousing/unpacking jobs - these pay as little as cashier or ""on the floor"" jobs and are at least 4 times as exhausting/soul-crushing. Seriously, go be a security guard or like become a burglar before doing what I did."
bad,"I would count the cash drawer and make sure things were ready for when the store opened."
bad,"Strict credit goals made work stressful. Hours were horrible, management did not manage well. High turnover rate. Not a lot of advancement opportunity. "
bad,"They were in a don't need to know basis. It was always an independent choice you  made on your own, without thier knowledge on your on basos. thiethierknowledge"
bad,Sears has done a great deal for my career. But there are also many downsides to working for them as mngt.  Toxic higher up leadership make very uninformed decisions.  Lacking and outdated technology makes jobs more difficult than need to be . And lack of training associates and managers alike make success difficult..
bad,"Al principio en ambiente Era bueno, luego se tornó hostil. A los jefes les interesa más tu vida privada que el apoyo que te brindan dándote dignidad en el trabajo. Muchas horas sin pago de tiempo extra"
bad,"Most employees have to compete for hours. Especially if you are a part-time worker, but every Sears location is different from one another. Other locations may offer fair hours."
bad,Sears no longer exists and is so sad of how many tens of thousands of Canadians who lost their job to people who don’t know our culture nor our language.
bad,"I will just say it wasn't for me. Also, don't take this job if you have no savings as it can take a month or two before your sales start to close. This job entails traveling to people's home to makes sales presentations and close them on the spot. Expect to put in 10 to 12 hours a day. It can be rewarding, if you're a good closer. Again, if you're flat broke, look elsewhere. Hope this help."
bad,"Great group of people."
bad,"A day starts with reviewing emails and a 30 minute scrum call.  The rest of the day is taken up with managing the team JIRA board, attending meetings, and following up on questions/issues that need answers."
bad,I understand I started as a HI sales but I did not expect such low commission rates to the point I am getting paid minimum wage every check.If you need sales experience then start here otherwise avoid.
bad,"Sears used to be a consistent place to get merchandise for every area of your home.  Specialized service was available to place orders for hard to come by sizes or items.  Unfortunately, Sears ""streamlined"" their sales processes by centralizing registers and therefore eliminated the specialized service and knowledgeability of that their sales representatives provided and possessed.  Now they are closing stores.  I would not seek employment here if you're looking for a longtime career."
bad,You need to be a people person to talk your customers into maintenance agreements and credit Sears pushes. The product you're selling is second on the list. Many times not available.
bad,"For the most part working with the general public was great.  You had regular customers, you could call by name and they in turn knew yours.  "
bad,"The call center environment is absolutely vile. Extremely rude and disorganized.  I have spent 6 hours in the last two days attempting to obtain my W2. What is wrong with this company? The representative couldn't find my information in the system. He kept asking if I had worked for Sears or an officiate company. I told him 4 times where I worked in the call center, the centers location and my name and social security number.      Run if you are seeking a real company. This place is a joke. "
bad,"I really enjoyed the work. However, the hours were terrible. Late evening hours in customer homes and in driving. Was frustrated with driving nearly 13,000 miles in 4 months. Compensation was very low. None given for wear and tear on car. Training was very poor."
bad,i would like to keep this private because the store i was working for is closed the whole company is likely to go out of business. i had no problems with anyone just that things could have been different.
bad,"I worked at sears for almost a year, Every day I had to commute over 45 minutes from home to work and vice versa. my co workers were great, but management was terrible. Always under the stress from their CEO's. It was not worth the commute. I was glad when home depot called me for another job opportunity"
bad,"Sears expected sales associates to close sale on the same appointment  at customers home,  The problem was products were often twice what you could purchase at other stores."
bad,"I worked for Sears over a decade in three different business units. All were run completely differently, almost like separate companies. If they could have standardized more across formats I believe a lot of waste and duplication could have been avoided. "
bad,"I loved almost everyone I worked with. Unfortunately, the writing was on the wall and people could see the crashing and burning of Sears Canada from miles away."
bad,"10 plus hours a day"
bad,"Work day 10-12 hours"
bad,"Company was more about pushing credit than taking care of the customer. The most enjoyable was taking care of the customers, the hardest part was trying to force credit cards on  people who did not understand the language"
bad,"It was okay working there as a part time job while in college, but I would never want to wok there as a career. Poor management, low wages, very indifferent employees."
bad,"Typical day starts at 8 AM and may not end until very late at night, depending upon the number and complexity of repair jobs assigned for the day. Sears has given me the opportunity to become certified as a refrigeration specialist. Upper management is poor and have taken a great company to bankruptcy; however, my direct manager is highly rated. He truly cares about what is best for his team. The hardest part of the job is sitting behind appliances in odd positions for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part is helping educate customers."
bad,"I worked multiple positions at once and only got paid minimum wage. I did more for that store than most people there. Not once did I see a raise. The store manager only came out of office to check numbers, then would go right back."
bad,The culture of upper management was very negative. They excepted more than could be accomplished with the amount of labor that was provided.  They changed from s customer focused business to being driven to cut costs at any cost. Even losing customers who were dedicated to Sears.
bad,A typical day at work would include putting out stock and organizing clothes.  Also ringing people up and providing great customer service.  Helping customers with any questions they may have.  Also preparing and finding web orders in the store and taking them to the back to be shipped out to customers.  The most difficult part of the job was probably dealing with angry customers at first but through experience I have learned to deal with that type of situation.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people if they had a difficult time finding something or had questions.
bad,"el inicio laboral es verificar la cobertura del personal,revisar la vigencia de las promociones ,analizar las ventas por asesor supervisar la limpieza y surtido de mercancía para asi garantizar un excelente servicio al cliente , por otra parte se  le da seguimiento a las áreas de acuerdo a lo proyectado en ventas para el mes apoyándose en estrategia de servicio y comunicación con el área de compras, motivar y asesorar al personal que baja su rendimiento y creatividad."
bad,"My manager was awesome, so my experience there was a lot better than most people. The company itself, however, was absolutely awful. They severely underpaid, there were no promotions, and hardly any raises. I worked with people who had been there forever and I know they were vastly unappreciated."
bad,Needs better management  one manager that was good but poor pay poor hours poor communications overlooked a lot activity and played favorites throughout the level of management
bad,Sears was an incredible place when I first started there in 2011. Managers helped improve employees and mentored as they went.  In recent years management was not in touch with its employees or customers.  Employees and customers where once treated with respect and management listened to both sides.  Not anymore....
bad,"It wasn't a horrible job, it was pretty cozy, in hindsight it was too cozy for my style, it made me much more lax and unwilling to push myself to work hard, as most of the job was just checking things all the time, making sure clothes were in order."
bad,"The store is going under, it got me by for a little bit but it's just not somewhere I would go back to. Manager was great, coworkers were great, but the company itself isn't."
bad,Management is poor. You're left on your own to deal with customers and managers rarely respond to requests. THe clientele is also not the greatest group of people to deal with.
bad,Store I worked at was closed. Sales were slumping toward the end and the flat commission structure was hard to live on. Fun coworkers. Good employee discount.
bad,"I enjoyed my starting position of warehouse receiving.  I was encouraged to take a job in Hardware merchandising.  I learned a lot and performed even more.  But I was the only one doing my job.  I had no help.  As a result I worked 10-12 hour days.  Some of my tasks weren't done when my day was done."
bad,it was okay only thing i ddint like was having to sign people up for credit cards and needed more hours and sometimes it was slow the workers and mangers was nice
bad,"Sears Techs are under trained, under paid, they very rarely repair anything on the first visit. Sears pushes you to sell their Maintenance Agreements to already angry customers. You can't earn PTO until after your first year. Probably not a bad place to work if you new to the business, stay for a year or two, get the Sears name on your resume and get out. They will hire just about anybody. Almost no experience required. The company is a revolving door."
bad,Management cares more about working hours than the people that actually have to work them. Explained to my manager that I would have scheduling restrictions but it didn’t seem to phase her.
bad,"Stores all over the country are closing, and they are pushing their mastercards to try to meet the quota and stay in business. If your numbers aren't good enough, they will cut your hours"
bad,"Was a great job to come to every day but largely because of my fellow associates and store managers. Unfortunately, the company went out of business and we all lost our jobs."
bad,Wasn't working here long just needed some cash at that time. Customers were often nice but most were unruly or rude. Coworkers were not helpful and it felt like every man for themselves
bad,Coworkers were great.  I just couldn't handle working 58 hours per week with no end in sight. Family problems forced me to leave. No time off and no excuses for probationary employees.
bad,Fast paced and hectic.learned about Retailing and merchandising.needs management improving. great workplace culture if retailing is your thing.the hardest part of the job is ever changing work hours.
bad,"Lack of support from management and jobs being changed without notice caused me to leave.  Company is closing stores, not replacing positions when open."
bad,They demand for you to get people to sign up for their credit cards. They want you to force and trick people into applying for credit cards. I didn't like being so pressuring to the customers I would offer the credit card and explain what it offers if the customer did not want to apply that was fine but the managers have a hard time understanding that.
bad,"It was alright at first, but Sears is a dying company and it started to affect hours and such. There really wasn't any type of career advancement and management seemed to be in their own bubble. The nail in the coffin for me was merging a bunch of job titles without any raise."
bad,"Sears is a decent company but bad management taken it to bankruptcy, really sorry to say that. "
bad,Despite being a member of management for seven years and there were no wage increases given! However they expect you to full fill multi roles to maintain store organization and stock. They also keep cutting hour of general help associates.
bad,"Prepare to play the dirty game of corporate servitude for cash. Your back will ache but you won't notice because you're too worried about how you are going to pay rent or buy food. Most go on to work for better treatment & pay with a sense of pride knowing they paid their dues in the proverbial trenches & then some have been wrongfully tainted w/an injust firing. With Sears' policy of of only being able to travel up on the ladder (never down), employees often find themselves unceremoniously fired for a serious misdeed where a record of misdeeds never existed. This ensures the employee won't be compensated with their own taxes due to job loss because the record shows them fired for wrongdoing. Great for Sears' bottomline but bad for people. I repeat, ""BAD FOR PEOPLE!!"""
bad,Only a matter of time. Symptom of what is plaguing retail in general as well as a company not knowing what it is compared to what it wants itself to be.
bad,"I didn’t like working at sears because I did not receive enough hours, & some of the workers were not so friendly. Working at this company wasn’t completely miserable but I would recommend it."
bad,"The company has no money to survive the next full year. If your looking for a future with this company, it won't be a long future. Make sure you have a backup plan."
bad,"La empresa es exelente en cuanto a aprendizaje. La cultura laboral no se aplica como tal, no reconocen al cien por ciento el ezfuerzo de los empleados que tienen bien puesta la camiseta de la empresa. En cuanto a mi ultima actividad fue provechosa y satisfactoria por conseguir en todo momento la satisfacción de los clientes asiduos y nuevos."
bad,"This was a second job but commisions continued to decrease as the company experienced financial difficulty. This is the reason I left sears"
bad,Started in the Automotive Dept. as a service advisor for two yrs. Then transferred to the Electronics Dept. another 2 yrs then  transferred to appliances till I left Sears.
bad,"In the 2.5 years I've been back, I, as well as many of the associates, have not received a raise. The employee discount was discontinued a year ago. There is little to no incentive to work harder, to climb the corporate ladder. Sears is struggling financially.  That said, you get out of the job what you put into it. I got to meet a lot of great people."
bad,"Very unprofessional work place. No work/life balance. No appreciation. If you are salary, you work about 60 hours a week. Visits from the district and region come often so you are constantly working OT without getting paid."
bad,"A very slow paced job, but friendly staff and managers. The managers always tried to make it a fun environment to work at and some great friends were made along the way."
bad,"aprendí mucho en esta empresa ,sobretodo en el área en el que me desempeñaba ,lastima que algunos gerentes no sepan de ética laboral,."
bad,"It is incumbent of any Corporation to value their Management Talent and Employees through  behavioral based actions that will enrich and enhance lives.  For example substantial consistent pay increases for years of service and dedication and company advancement based on achievements and skills vs Upper Management personal likes or dislikes completely not job related. "
bad,"Was not too bad to work for when you are selling, but as soon as you become a lead, assistant manager for beyond it was hot or miss. Store struggles without an actual Store manager in place at the time I was there. Ended up closing in 2012"
bad,"I managed 2 employees and had a very good relationship with them. I made sure they made their sales for the week. I had company calls once a week and always made sure customers were happy. I made mementos for my customers and they were always happy with their product, which helped me move my store sales up instead of down (which is had been). I also dealt with customers on the daily and made sure they were happy  whenever the came in. As a manager I also had to deal with inventory, the cash box, and customer experience."
bad,Very unprofessional company and very negative with employees. Managers don’t know how to work there role as there ask for but yet tend to be on every employees back.
bad,"No real training. Commission was changed and no longer pays out. A lot of busy work, building appliances, cleaning floors and bathroom, even though it is commission only."
bad,"The store was in disrepair, How they remained open for so many years with those conditions I do not know.  My supervisor was top in sales and promoted without training and was not provided support that he needed from upper levels. the store was in shambles.  Mechanics were working with ancient compressors and unsafe conditions.  I cleaned up the bathroom because the cleaning crew would not.  I feel so bad for anyone still there.  It is my opinion that Sears is in such trouble that instead of consolidation and revamping their image they held on and held on until it was too late."
bad,Managers were always unavailable to find and don't care about their workers. I was given 4 hours a week sometimes in a sales department. They did have bbq's and provided lunch sometimes. Managers would schedule you on days you couldn't work. My manager would give more hours to new hires and men than women. I would not recommend working here at all.
bad,The manager of loss prevention was great.  The company is going down. They would have only one loss prevention person working and then make the rules very tuff to apprehend  someone stealing.
bad,This company was good being that it was the second company that I had worked for. I learned a lot during the time I worked for here. The only thing is that there was just no job security.
bad,"After inspecting the equipment, we had to get ready for studio appointments and photo shoots.  Management trained all employees on how to operate the equipment and computers and how to take proper portrait photos."
bad,Sears is no longer in operation but at one point in time Sears was a good place to work.  They had employee paid benefits paid sick days.  They were very family oriented.  They had family picnics and christmas parties.  Immediate management was very good to work for.  There was always different jobs to learn.
bad,"Training was non-existent; Management was inefficient"
bad,"The Store Manager is a complete idiot and literally has no idea how to do anything. He does everything the way that he wants, disregarding national presentation standards and everything else regarding to how things are suppose to be done. He has been there for almost 4 years now and cant operate a cash register."
bad,"I was a sales position in the Electronics section of the store. I was encouraged to sell everything electronic, for 70"" televisions to the wires to attach to them."
bad,"Very cut throat environment.   Challenging.  Fast paced, but was again a great opportunity to broaden my skills in art and design. A learning experience. Customer service aspect was great, learning about people gives a great insight to ones style."
bad,"The training program they have in place is very broad and not properly tailored to in store positions. My managers were very friendly but didn't really know how to run a store properly. It's a very stressful environment because the store is failing and all management does is push credit card applications and encourage staff to lie to members about their reward points. The worst part of this job is the pay and low amount of hours. On the bright side, they are flexible with attendance and scheduling and they don't micromanage."
bad,j ai appris plusieurs poste de travail dans la compagnie
bad,"The company's policy is stubborn and outdated, as are the typical customers that it receives. During my time working there it was hard to find things to do as there were not a whole lot of customers."
bad,They fired me right after my house burnt down because I took my fifteen minute alloted break. I ended up finding out that I could have pursued them for unlawful termination.
bad,I was laid off from a halfway decent job. Company is dying and constantly reinventing themselves. Never giving anything implemented time to work. Cutthroat competition from fellow associates. No teamwork.
bad,"This company does not value employees as it once did, I do not recommend employment at SHC. I excelled on all my performance reviews, yet I never received a raise....ever in 5 years."
bad,"i was hired to be a lawn and garden field service technician, all management cares about is sales first of all i'm not a salesman if i wanted that o be my job i would have worked at a used car lot!"
bad,I would not recommend working for a company that is continually downsizing.  I was a salaried manager and was expected to work 60+ hours a week at different time schedules daily. No way to have any work-life balance.
bad,I get paid off of commission so I make as much as I sell but the hours are few and managament is constantly changing.  We no longer receive an employee discount either.
bad,"The culture is one of slack.  No one wants to work hard for what they get, and the management has let this go on for years.  Just look around at the store, and you can see that no one cares."
bad,"Trying to evolve into ""online only""  Company.  High up management changing procedures all the time and caring little about employees nor customers IN THE STORE - only the online ones.  Too much ""Middle"" Management (which was changing continuously) and not enough power for the local Management team. Micro managed"
bad,I didn’t like the manager to much and the work and business was very very slow had to have a doctors note to sit and i was pregnant and they didn’t let me get a chair till I got that note
bad,"Sears needs to focus on how to bring more customers into the stores and not worry so much about emails and online ordering"
bad,"No one ever showed up but we were still required to open 10 credit cards a day, we were lucky to see 10 people in some of our shifts. If you didn't meet your quota they would cut hours. I worked during a merger with another sears so everyone was on edge because of their job security."
bad,"Sears was not a bad place to work, but with future corporate outlook, I recommend only taking a position there if you must. There is no future financial stability within the organization at this time."
bad,I started working for them after a great training course not knowing what their performance expectations were going to be. Once on the job I quickly found out that it was all about up sell.
bad,"Too many layers of management lead to poor corporate vision. "
bad,This was a job I got during my final year in high school. The only thing i liked about thins place were the satisfied customers that left. The second liked thing for me about this place was my coworkers.
bad,"The store had required metrics and if you didn't meet them, your hours would get cut. It was very hard to meet these metrics because nobody shops at sears anymore."
bad,Horrible corporate. IF you dont get enough credit apps you don't get hours. Your availability is not respected. There is a ridiculous amount of favoritism by the management.
bad,"Manager was supportive of family life."
bad,Sears was always slow. at some points we wouldn't have a single customer. When we did have customers they almost always used coupons or points so they wouldn't have to pay full price.
bad,"At the time, the service manager was not up to standards that a manager should be. Any issues with the shop was not dealt with in an efficient manner."
bad,Allot of drama between coworkers and management. Pay was ok but the hours were not good. Was hired as full time permanent but was let go/laid off within a couple months as the busy time was over.
bad,Sears is a company where there is little to no advancement and is a at will company . Which means they can dismiss you at any time and no raises or cost of living increases. all training is on the job.
bad,"Sears does not have proper equipment to do work that needs to be done and the equipment they have is barely functioning. They train backroom associates to do a multitude of different tasks but the position can be paid as low as minimum wage. Work effort does not reflect in your paycheck at Sears. It is clear that Sears is not willing to put in the money and effort to show that they care about their employees, or even their customers. Boxes in delivery trucks are crammed into the truck in a way that damages many of them, several of which are intended for customer pick ups, and requires employees to lift excessively heavy packages off of tall stacks without any equipment to assist."
bad,Overall not a horrible place to work if you are in your teens or just starting out however the push for credit cards is going to drive a lot of potential workers away due to such high expectations.
bad,"Need fresh millennial blood in this company to survive. Needs a re-branding too. CEO/Chairman not being visible in HQ and not being with boots on the ground is setting up the company for failure. Silos everywhere. BU's coached to compete against each other. More Indian or British speaking management and upper level employees than Americans, you would think its a foreign company."
bad,"Small, family-owned operation (nepotism)"
bad,"Our store was very much overly micromanaged for the majority of the time that I was there, both on the part of the district manager with the store manager, and then the store manager with our automotive technicians. "
bad,continuously changing and unfortunately not in a good way. Were some great people there but were let go. Job was always made ti feel like you are replaceable
bad,"I helped restock clothing shelves in the womens clothing department. I cleaned store, was a cashier and learned about counting the registar after hours, making sure it had enough money for the next day shift. Helped guests find products and took all incoming calls."
bad,"it worked around my school schedule however the pay was low and everything however it isn't a place to have a career with. With the large amount of stores closing, not knowing if your store is next is stressful."
bad,"Work/life balance is the biggest downside of working here. Income potential is there, but declining. Leads are provided, but not the greatest quality. Training is provided and can be very helpful."
bad,I choose not to write a novel about the numerous things wrong with Sears. Discord between sales associates.Management is incompetent and even subtly abusive at times. No true leadership.
bad,"you open registers, greet customers and watch out for people doing shenanigans. the discount is nice but there was hardly anyone going to the store since most of the clients were being lost to online."
bad,"everyday is a new day, direction changes, false hope, optimistic CEO has a hidden agenda, company has filed for bankruptcy protection. ars USA is still pulling the strings as to what will ultimately happen with the Canadian company."
bad,Was given a section of the store to straighten the shelves and keep the aisles tidy. The manager would come around and complain about the state of the aisle you started in when you haven't even made it to the end of your section yet. Giving customers roughly 2 hours to undo the work I had done in that section before I was able to loop back around to it. The manager wanted one person to keep a large section of the store 100% perfect 100% of the time.
bad,"Used to be a great great company to work for in the past. Tech will learn alot about appliance, but poor manager will make you want to quit. Will not go back"
bad,Spend countless hours doing computer training that doesn't even pertain to your job. They throw you up on the cash register without giving you proper training. Management doesn't care about their employees at all! They are good with working around school schedules and giving you time off that you requested.
bad,"Tough times for retail and especially this Company. Cuts to the store base and the support teams are constant and looming. Still some great people that work there, but little opportunity remains."
bad,Sears is ok place to work and I enjoy my work but they have really been cutting positions and I never know when Im going to go to work and be told my position has been cut. Sears is trying to restructure and have been closing stores left and right.
bad,"The culture at Sears is different from anything else I've experienced. The PTO is great and there are a lot of options to chose from when deciding which medical provider you would like to chose, however they are all extremely pricey.  Management doesn't communicate with one another and overall the environment is very reactive."
bad,no comment for what i have to say is really evil and will be one sided so i choice not to say anything. they are  big on telling you one thing and it not be true at all. see i just pulled a sears.
bad,"My experience working at Sears 2497 has been O.K. I just don't like the environment of that store. Current managers are not helpful, one of them spends 95% of the time talking down on other associates, they expect so much from us with just minimum wage, I guess if you're a first time job seeker, it;s an alright job, but after a while, you get sick of it. There's almost no people like 80% of the time and gets boring, especially on long shifts."
bad,Sears is not the best company. This is the job you want in high school. Very few hours and the pay is commission based. No benefits besides the store discount
bad,"-Enjoyed the work that I did but management could use improvement"
bad,little advancement too much training for non related job requirements. scheduling was not consistent and not enough people on the sales floor to help customers.
bad,"The people I work with are incredible.  They are sharp and motivating.  Unfortunately, Sears is struggling to compete in a difficult retail environment so morale and confidence in leadership and the business model is low."
bad,"challenging"
bad,A typical day at work would involve doing cash transactions and making sales. I learned how to save customers money. Management was nice.The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to get credit. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get deals and save money on their purchases.
bad,"If you are a cashier, watch out! You will get the boot if you don't receive enough credit card applications. The job itself is enjoyable if you enjoy customer service."
bad,At starting in November 2015 was great to work for. Know June 2017 it is basically failing rapidly. workers are good. management is ok. we are not busy. merchandise we receive is in good shape. overall I  still work there.
bad,"Nice location, well maintained, few managers actually care about their employees. Other than that, the other managers are disrespectful and unappreciative of hard work. They love to give part time hours so don't apply if you want a lot of hours."
bad,"Poor communication with staff. Not respected for what you can do."
bad,The photography aspect of the job is enjoyable until the sessions are overbooked due to customer demand. The management is under payed so they do what they can but are limited. The culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is balancing between the sales aspect and the creative process of photography. The most enjoyable part is working with the public.
bad,"Management is the absolute worst."
bad,Sears is struggling as a company but working there has its perks. Fun and engaging associates make it worth the while. Management varies from store to store but most are good at leveraging their associates.
bad,The hours are terrible. The managers harass you if you don't manage to obtain new credit applications. If you don't sell enough credit cards then your hours will be cut.
bad,"Okay place to work for high school and college students"
bad,Very slow paced environment. Commission sales made it very competitive when there was hardily no business coming into the store. Management was on a constant turnover and made it difficult for stability.
bad,"Promised 5 weeks of training, received 3 days and told to figure it out. I was a manager at their auto center. My district manager is an example of why they have so many issues in my opinion."
bad,Pay rate is at the minimum at Sears. You don't get many hours. Management did not work half of the time; they would sit around talking and eating. i liked the fact that I met new people and helped LP.
bad,I hated working there. Some of my coworkers were pretty cool but I recommend not working at the sears in Del Amo mall. The managers would talk a bunch of trash about you and that's not ethical at all.
bad,"I enjoy my personal manager at the jewelery counter, however the store management is relatively useless. They never come when you call for help, they take extra long breaks and you can't find them 90% of the time because they're hiding in their offices. They cut hours constantly, so if you're looking for consistency, this Sears location isn't the place for you. When the management does something that wouldn't be acceptable in any relaiable place of business, and you decide to call employee relations, expect to be told to do what they because they are higher up. I've been here for 10 months and I feel like I need to get out before I suffocate. The only really decent thing about this Sears location is that my personal manager is extremely flexible with scheduling, this came in handy being in college."
bad,"Began as a Receiving individual, working 2-4 days per week unloading delivery trucks.  Once unloaded worked at unpacking products and preparing them for display upon the sales floor.  Also located goods in the stock room when goods were ready for the floor.  Refilled the sales floor when items were sold to customers."
bad,"Their computers are older than I am (20+ years old), making them unbearably slow and prone to malfunction, leading to further stress with impatient customers. The push for credit cards most people do not want creates an enormous hurdle for employees trying to move up in the company."
bad,"Working at Sears has been an awful experience so far. The management is friendly but disorganized and unprofessional, and the other employees are generally rude, unhelpful, and unprofessional. They make no attempt to make a customer feel welcome or comfortable."
bad,I worked for the company for a little over 2 years before the massive lay offs. The store I worked at the sore manager thought he was also AP and tried to micro manage and failed on multiple ocassions. The pros are you make your own schedule and you can adjust it whenever necessary. Other pros atleast in my case the district manager was awesome and there was not anyone constantly looking over your shoulder all the time. Depending on the team your on it could be a valueable experience because I learned alot in my short time there. However the con is you never know when you will be let go. Every febuary you have to worry about if you will have a job or not.
bad,I was there for a lil while my time there was short I liked it for a little bit until they started putting me as an on-call when I needed hours daily to make ends meet it got kind of stressful
bad,"I don't actually work for Sears, but I do contract for them. Its very unorganized, and stressful. On the other hand working in the field me myself I have learned a lot and I wont be paying Sears to install anything I buy, because I know how."
bad,"people who work in this particular store are a great associates very competitive and show pride and ownership in every day basic activities. We need more company support. Pay roll is not reflecting the job duties, even the associates use every minute to work, the time offered for task is not according with the job activities. Sears as a company is great. It can be better if they use some of the resources to improve employees life quality as raise, recognition, and the necessary pay roll to execute the job."
bad,"I worked here for about 7 months, I honestly loved the job itself. I was constantly running around doing projects therefore work flew by and I wasnt being bossed around about things because I worked hard. I started out as a floor associate so meaning I would help people find what they were looking for, keep fitting rooms clean along with racks and shelf's, and keep the store full of products. When I first started their women's intimate section was just a mess, so I organized it completely and made it look really nice. Doing so they made me manager, but I got no raise. I also learned how to function the registers, still got no raise. When closing you can be fixing the store for a few hours depending on how bad the manager wants to leave. I clashed with Ellen(?) in HR because when I started work, they said our schedules would be available in the schedule book in the office and online, and the office schedule didn't match the online schedule so I ended up ""no calling and no showing"". I screen shot the online schedule and somehow management didn't like me. I ended up getting frustrated with no raise though I worked harder than the others. I know I should have spoke to the store manager, but I was offered a job that paid more and it was doing something I was passionate about, so I quit and did not put in my two weeks. I am on the do not hire list now and even tried calling and explaining myself a year later and no response."
bad,I personally did not like the work atmosphere there is a lot of drama and the management wasn't very helpful. I did learn about the call center environment and gained a new skill in customer service which has helped better me for future employment.
bad,"Worked long days and hours to support a company who struggled to achieve profit goals and keep facilities updated. The work place culture was negative on many days. The most difficult part of working for Sears Holdings Company was the pressure they put on the associates when sales, profit, and other goals were not met."
bad,"Sadly, they are going out of business and all the good leaders have already left.  That and you never know when you will be laid off.  I was paid well, could work from home and worked on great projects.  But with the declining store sales it just isn't a good situation."
bad,"Awful support from upper management, little to no training provided. Benefit options were too expensive and the premiums are way too high. All in all the benefits suck"
bad,"The company is poor on retaining good talents, high turn over from the management team to all levels.  Poor system, hard to find useful information.  People here often focused on what the manager asked for instead of what really important."
bad,"Minimum wage pay for backroom employees, who work the most physically demanding jobs in the store. Low hours as well, quit after getting cut back to 12hr week. Overall employees and workplace was pretty good place to work. No benefits offered, not likely to get a wage increase."
bad,"If you are looking to grow within a company, this is not the place for you. They lie in the beginning about how there is room for growth within the company but, any other position they have are positions that have been filled by people that have been there 8+years and there's no way they are leaving. I worked as a customer service representative in their very small call center. This place has enough room for about 10 representatives. They show extreme favoritism. The pay is decent, benefits are ok, but management is awful. They all have that entitled attitude as if they are too good to even help their employees so the open door policy is not really open door. Nobody stays with this company for long other than the few that are just settling for 8+ years. They can't even keep a Human Resource Administrative Assistant that's when you know it's bad. This company needs a lot of improvement."
bad,"Culture wise was ok, but it was not an organized company in many ways, the salary was below market rate."
bad,"This store was a new store when set up and was fun to do, but the starting manager was not trained with the new employees and outside management just trained with basic knowledge.  "
bad,sears seasonal only allowed you to stay longer than the season if you had a good amount of customer credit cards opened up while your employment with the company.
bad,"I was in charge of customer questions, and making sure the store was nice and neat and stock was placed in the right order. Everyone was very helpful and understanding of me being new and helped as much as possible."
bad,I worked for the company for 19 years in various department in which I mastered the rules and procedures in yet did not get so much as a reviewe in order to get a raise. My years seem as a waste of life. Management was based on favorites
bad,"Nice people but company is suffering - fun working with good people but never knowing what future holds in the long term. If you don't need something to last a long time, this company may be for you"
bad,"If you're not Hispanic you can just forget about trying to apply they will not keep you as most of the workers are Hispanic as well as customers. The job is VERY boring and the pay is literally minimum wage, 8.05, for standing in a hot store for hours."
bad,"Lots of work"
bad,Not much going on at Sears these days. After putting out clothes from the truck its hard to stay busy. Management was too relaxed and didnt give good direction. Not really an exciting nor well paying job.
bad,"This company has thepotential to become a competitive company with high earning, but they are operating on antique ideas and processes. They dont understand the basic concept that they people is their most valuable asset."
bad,When i started at sear i loved it but now being there 5 years i now don't feel appreciated at my job nor do i feel like it is an enjoyable place to work anymore
bad,"The lines are always long due to cashiers having to ask for credit cards they don't just ask one time, but multiple times. If you don't get credit you get no hours. Management is also slow. I would not recommend this job. Hours shouldn't be made based on how many credit apps you get. A Cashiers job should be just to ring out customers to make the lines go down so customers don't have to wait 5 minutes or more just to check out. Had to do unnecessary computer training a lot about things you already know."
bad,"Great for quick money, make money at ones own pace. There were some pro's and con's to a commission based job. Not much room for moving around or promotion."
bad,"It's no secret that Sears is fading fast and likely to be 100% closed before the end of 2017.  The worst part is that management tries to act like everything is perfect and there are no concerns about closing.  The stress of not knowing if your'e going to have a job each day is not easy to walk into.  That, and the completely disarray and lack of communication from the top down makes running a store a nightmare.  Heavily understaffed and over worked is the norm for the auto centers.  You're expected to increase sales and revenue and drive car count and customer satisfaction, all with only a couple mechanics and no more than 1 sales person.  It's amazing people are still seeking employment here.  Techs are paid close to 40% less than the competition.  The company is to a point where they won't let managers buy real chairs for the waiting rooms, and instead have to use worn out patio furniture."
bad,"Ancient technology in every corner. "
bad,"good people in maintenence department , hove access to all material needed. able to work flex ahours to acomidate home hours."
bad,Counted register. Dealt with customers at the register. Learned a lot about pricing of retail items. Management were always pushing issues towards customers (who in return get tired of hearing the same routine). Co-workers were awesome! Asking customers to open credit card account with retail establishment. Most enjoyable aspect of the position was dealing with the customers and seeing joy in their faces when they were completed with the purchase.
bad,"Good opportunities to learn and advance your career."
bad,"over all, bad management. The store is totally a mess, and no items will  be sold if they are  not on sale. No proper training at all."
bad,"Constant badgering by management about how to run the store. There were 3 conference call a day, and all were about what has happened in the past. Little to no motivational tools given to employees. Did not see my boss until after 4 months after I was hired."
bad,"12 hours"
bad,Everyone had an attitude. They did not really care about the associates unless you were getting people to sign up for those stupid credit cards. I am so glad to be out of that h hole. Started getting a headache every time I walked near the entrance. They weren't paying enough either for it to be such a big company.
bad,The pay was terrible and the commission was an insult. Management was standard. Co-workers were racist and insensitive. A pro was that you could always be on your phone because business was always slow except for on Saturdays.
bad,I wish not to provide a review as it was a long time ago. The company had county wide closures and my store was one of them to close. The training was endless though but very pointless.
bad,"The work environment was mostly negative. A lot of employee complaining about the management being ineffective."
bad,Buen ambiente de  trabajo pero horarios no muy accesibles aprendí muchísimo sobre ser un buen vendedor y sobre todo en la atención al cliente
bad,"When business was better and you had plenty to do days went quick and smoothly, Pay not so great, went from commission to hourly then back to commission with a base rate lower than minimum wage at $6/hr. and commission percentages of 0.5% to 1%."
bad,"the job is definitely not worth it. managers only seem to care about themselves, they do not look out for you. had two store managers quit in short period of time"
bad,"A typical day is consistent of selling items to the customers, selling credit cards, restocking the shelves of missing merchandise, cleaning the department, and meeting quotas for the month. I've learned how to constantly meet quotas that companies need, how to make sure that customers get what they want, and how to keep professionalism and integrity during high energy parts of the day such as Black Friday. The management wasn't the best to work around. They often went missing when customers were demanding to see them or to speak to them. That doesn't go for all of the managers who worked there. My co-workers were hard workers. Any question that they had, they relied on me to answer them and they learned quickly. The hardest part of my job has to be taking the role of the managers without having their authority to override certain things that need their approval. The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers who don't know anything about a certain item and being able to teach them about that said item."
bad,"I worked here for 10 months and it was a great learning experience dealing with cash deposits and other clerical duties. The position was part time and so are 95% of the other positions in the store, so therefore, NO BENEFITS are offered. When I applied for the position, it said 20-25 hours a week. Once I completed training with the other Office Associate, I learned that I would be her back up and would only work 2 days a week for about 4 hours a day, and also on days that she could not come in. "
bad,"I use to work at this sears auto center. this is not a place you want to work they have a don't turn work away policy so on a night that you are sapose to be out at 7 you could easily end up staying until 8 30. Management doesn't care if you are thorough mechanic or not they care about numbers.if you work ethic is complete garbage it doesn't matter as long as you look good on paper that's all that matters. You get written up for calling out sick, there attendance policy is a joke. its a point system that represents a six month window. management is a joke you tell your boss legit concerns and they do absolutely nothing about it. Loyalty to the company means nothing in there eyes everyone is replaceable. they constantly over load you with work you may be the only mechanic working one day because they run very small crews of 3 to 4 techs. some of your co workers are there to help you and others are only there for themselves. I did learn alot over the years."
bad,"At the time I held this position, Sears was borrowing money to keep the company afloat. After this announcement, many employees jumped ship.  Health insurance was expensive and the culture was chaotic and not very professional"
bad,"Gestion des inventaires, de l'entrepôt, gestion des opérations, du personnel, des ventes, rappel clients, etc."
bad,Fun employees but for reasons such as management the company is going under. We all saw it coming but there was nothing to be done.
bad,It is clear from working at Sears that drastic changes are needed and needed quickly.  The company moves very slow to implement changes and they are simply running out of time.
bad,"I did not have a good experience. It could have been the store manager as it seemed they were always willing to pass blame and not take any accountability for anything. The store manager asked me to violate rules set by a vendor and  I refused. I can't bring myself to work for someone like that so I left and then contacted the district manager (calling daily to the corporate office for three days before he called back) and their reply was only that ""wish we could go back in time"" and ""I'll address these issues"".  To date it has been  10 days with no return word but my position is posted here as vacant...."
bad,"basically, wasn't making enough money or working enough hours to survive. Had about 3 store managers there while I was employed, only thing good about it was all of the employees got along."
bad,"To me Sear's is an unstable Company that just pull people in just to kick out employees that have been there for years. Sears is a shopping Center full of gossip. I was only their for a month or less and heard more life stories than ever at a job. the manager I had was very cool but the other ones not so much, as far as the other staff they were fair. I gained sales experience from sears and most on my own due to the fact that every staff is your competition."
bad,"I spent 24 years with Sears Canada inc, working from the ground up, over the years i had witnessed many changes, and i still maintain many contacts from the past"
bad,"Working for sears gave me good work experience but management is horrendous. Sears don't give you enough hours and they pay minimum wage and it's a lot of work, so be prepared to work your butt off for a small check.  Corporate doesn't care about you, all they care about is the bottom line, so if you get a job somewhere else and you have to choose between that job and sears go with the other job."
bad,"There are about 10-20 different metrics. If you are successful in any it is overlooked, and only the negative has focus. In addition to the metrics, there are loads of tasks to accomplish. The company gives hours for the tasks, but the store cuts hours to save payroll. So be prepared to work off the clock or get yelled at for not completing assignments. Shoppers are constantly tearing through the sales floor like tornados. Almost no one keeps their kids with them and they destroy things. Also, be prepared to constantly hear ""this is why this place is going out of business."" Most people that say that are making some crazy demand in an attempt to be compensated for time wasted, aggravation, or just being irritated. The pay is low, but there are several ways to upsell to make more. There are way too many managers over everything and that makes a lot of things confusing. I don't blame them though because there are just as many district managers that are pulling them in 15 different directions. HR is nonexistent at best. If you are able to talk to anyone, they have 25 stores to deal with and you have no priority on their list. Oh and I almost forgot they have decided that there will be no more pay increases. So if your job isn't eliminated, you will be making the same until you leave."
bad,"It was good people to work for, but not enough hours to finish the projects you were assigned. They are in the process of closing the store."
bad,"I found from this job that I genuinely enjoy knowing everything about what I'm selling and helping the people who come to me for my knowledge. I sell fitness equipment and I love it, I like retail, and I like commission. Being on commission teaches you the value of actively caring about those you are helping, you want them safe, healthy, and above all you want them to love their product. It is an investment each time you sell an item. My co-workers are great and we help each other and take care of each other. A family in the workplace is what people strive for and its something I've found. I gave Sears a 2 because overall the company cares more about its numbers than taking care of the associates and members. I've had horrible boss after horrible boss, but the reason why I have stayed for so long is because of the first great boss I have now. I enjoy selling because I believe in our products, I stay because I love my boss. But it is time to move on, I have learned all I can and it is time for me to see what I am capable of doing on my own."
bad,"If you're going to work at Sears, make sure you know exactly what you're getting into. I can't speak for every location, but this was how things went for me."
bad,"I like working in retail because I love talking to people. I learned a lot about having patience, and being able to stay calm when a customer becomes irate. The hardest part of the job was selling credit, the managers really pushed the employees there. My favorite part of the job was cashing people out and just talking to them. Finding the best deals for them. Making sure that they are happy,"
bad,"I worked here for two years, and was told often that I was a good employee, and a valuable team member. The restaurant lead never gave me a chance to advance and acted as if I was incapable of doing anything. Management here was pretty rude, too, for no real reason at all. The work was super fun, and I got a lot of experience during my ime here."
bad,"Sears was a convenient place to work when I lived in Brea.  I was new to California and not able to secure a position in my former field."
bad,"The overall culture is that of expecting the work of 3 people from one person and then bullying and berating you when you are unable to deliver according to their standards.  I do not speak of the store manager as mine was completely awesome and tried to shield me from the upper management that treated their people that way.  Their idea of training is read some materials on the computer and you are trained and we expect you to understand and know everything, even if you walked into a mess.  They are a typical corporation that judges according to what the paperwork says rather than what is really going on within the store, they think the ""metrics"" tell the whole story.  When you attempt to explain the situation you are accused of making excuses and ignoring corporate processes and policy then followed by being called everything but free white and 21."
bad,"Sears doesnt give raises, long hours, typical retail gig, bad management, high turnover rate for not meeting sals metrics, the coworkers is what makes the job,"
bad,The days are long even with a 45 minute break. Management doesn't oversee projects as diligently as they ought to. Responsible workers are always shafted with the difficult tasks to compensate for incompetent employees.
bad,"very few hours"
bad,"coworkers and a few managers help make it a worth while experience"
bad,Short staffed in cashier department. They over work you but did care about your wants. Pay is low and management is for self. they made sure all their needs were met but didnt care about their workers. i had surgery and they threaten to fire me because i needed a certain amount of recovery days. i would never work for sears again
bad,This Job sucked overall. You do not prosper at all. The management treated certain employee's superior and their employees still were not content. They work you hard and under pay you for a warehouse job.I was a merchandise processor for five years and  did not see anybody  get a promotion. They cut individuals hours without any determination or specific reason.My wits end was the fact they are careless about your livelihood. You do not get full time and you do not get promoted at all.
bad,Sears was once a very enjoyable place to work with decent wages. The culture changed tow years ago and our commissions got cut and overall expectations increased.
bad,I personally didn't like working here because the management sucked. and they never schedule you during your availability. The managers at this location are very unreasonable as well. and the work load was too much. I am not a fan of retail personally.
bad,"They are able to work with your schedule, in the location I transferred too, sales were minimal so commission ended up getting me minimum wage, management is poor and they expect too much out of a person for what they pay you (credit app/metric expectations)."
bad,Sears is a company that has suffered with the bad economy and because of that they have to do more with less. You will work ever weekend and night for little reward and have to deal with crazy office politics. Would not recommend no home life balance
bad,Can be slow and extremely backed up at times like all jobs you ring customers and have to ask them are they interested in the lines of credit that we offer and that can go one way or the other depending on the customer they often get annoyed fast because our employees are required to ask every time they purchase something and it can also be unnecessary between employees that can cause an uncomfortable work environment at times
bad,"while I worked at sears a short period of time, it was easy to see what the company was about: a typical day at sears would usually include trying to get people to sign up for the sears credit card while using a ipad to bring them through the checkout process ( a lengthy and unnecessary step in the sale) "
bad,Seers automotive is and ok job. the pay sucks the work is not bad work. they wont help you if you're injured to be careful not to hurt yourself. Coworkers are cool. Management seemed to have no clue about the industry.
bad,"I applied at this job simply because I was laid off my previous job and got desperate And would take anything, even if it was seasonal. This was seasonal. They interviewed and hired me pretty quick. They called me literally 20 minutes after I submitted the online application. The Assistant manager interviewed me and promised to be flexible with my college.. I'll get to that later. I was a backroom associate and payed $7.90 an hour.. I unloaded merchandize trucks, lifted heavy appliances every day, sweat, wore out my muscles, shipped items, delivered items, stocked and located items, etc and only paid minimum wage. I believe if you're doing a job like this where it requires putting your body in danger you need more wages. Do you know how many extremely heavy items we have to lift? Not only that but from in the air too. Scheduling was terrible. I always had to beg the ASM to change the schedule pretty much every week because she scheduled me to work at times I had college courses. Either she pretended she forgot or she would tell me to deal with it. I couldn't turn to the Store Manager because she was too busy dealing with her bosses. But the department managers had nearly as much power as a SM or ASM so they were always happy to fix the schedule. The job was so boring you could literally hide somewhere and just text. You'll literally be missing for hours and no one will notice (I'm not the best 20 year old worker I'll admit, but I only care if my employer cares). You were always expected to sell additional items as a cashier and promote their Shop your way rewards which I don't"
bad,The only thing i will miss about thus place is the people that i worked with. The higher ups have no idea what they are doing or how to run a store and this is why the company is failing. They have so much potential to do more.
bad,"It's a disorganized place some of the assistant managers don't help with difficult customers its an awful place to me. They are not convenient for the customers that are in need or the employees. We have a lot of complaints from most customers I advise anyone that's looking for a part time job to not apply here because most people that work here do not last long because of the compensation, hours, or the personnel."
bad,Sinking ship. I did not want to be there when it all crumbles. Constantly switching managers and associates. No stability.
bad,The customer's make your day here because they are the only thing that keep you from screaming like a crazy person. I do not understand the management and at this point I don't want to. There's no hours at this job. I am still trying to figure out how they expect you to live but I forgot all they care about is their self.
bad,the sales department was horrible.  the pressure to offer on every call wether the customer was mad or not. commission starts to look funny after a while. and forced hours that are just inconvient.
bad,i was a MCA in footwear they gave no hours except during holidays and then proceeded to take me off the schedule without notice would not recommend working here you can do better
bad,"Fun place to work but, always explore all opportunities. The benefits are good but the company is small without much room for growth."
bad,"Managers were very demanding of employees to sign customers up with a credit card. If you did not sell enough credit cards they would put you up for a probationary period and employees who had been there 20+ years were at risk of losing their job."
bad,"A typical day at work can be somewhat stressful when dealing with customers.  I have learned from working in the retail profession, customer service is first and foremost if the business is to be successful however, management needs improvement in seeing that the customers have an enjoyable shopping experience.  The hardest part of my job is keeping fitting rooms clean and orderly and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a happy customer."
bad,"Stocking, pricing, maintaining inventory. Daily job duties depend on what is needed.  Department needs to be maintained so that sales associates can sell."
bad,I really loved working here at first but my moral for the job has declined over the years and management does not even care anymore.
bad,"I worked in the Women's section.  I did inventory, stocked shelves, moved displays around, also did cash out counter.  Did customer service.  Was asked to work different sections when they were short. Helped at night to straighten the store before closing.  Management was flicked.  I didn't know from day to day who my manager was. The co-workers were great. The hard part about the job was staying within their uniform color guidelines.  Being Christmas time I would put on a vest with Christmas colors and they would object. Of course the most enjoyable time was working and helping the customers."
bad,"management was lacking leadership skills, my schedule went from working 30 hours a week to 9 hours a week.  did not get commission for an extended period of time even though my training modules were not working properly for me nor any other associate"
bad,"I worked on the floor stocking,check fitting rooms,return clothes to floor. I was promoted to an early am shift. Where I would do sign changes, displays,build children's products. I found the management aspect disorganized, not caring about staff. I has some helpful staff others just wanted their shift to end. I would often be told to work  more hours many times without breaks. I enjoyed my early am promotion."
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. Pays minimum wage, no room for advancement, and management is horrible. If you like swindling people into messing up their credit for those sears cards, great place for you. Discounts are great and the rewards program is great."
bad,Great time working with staff. Management lacks in team support. Learned a lot from my supervisor and met amazing people.
bad,"Where do I start? I love the people I work with for the most part. They make it worth not quitting. "
bad,Great for a starter job. If you're looking for a career look elsewhere. It doesn't matter how many hours your work or how hard you work you get paid the same low rate per hour.
bad,"This job should be put under review, or even the company for that matter.The company has been in decline for quite some time and it hasn't improved at all."
bad,the store itself will consume your life. you will be threatened daily if you have a pregnant wife at home like me and you need to leave due to complications with your child.
bad,"Working in sales is similar to fishing, with Sears it's fishing, but the boat is sinking. "
bad,"I was a CSA at at store in Mass, I worked there for a year and I half. The pay and commission were horrible, and the hours were worse. Some days I'd get a few customers in others I'd be lucky to even get a phone call. They also laid off a bunch of people myself included,  before holiday season because the company is going under. Stay away from sears at all cost."
bad,Double standards and favoritism at their best here at Kokomo Sears.
bad,I have had some good times at Sears but I do not make enough money for the hours and work that is being done. Management is forever changing and not stable. Also Sears is closing many of their stores and I do not want to be employed there if they are closing.
bad,Being pressured to make customers apply for a Sears card. I learned nothing new. Management was ok. Co-workers were mostly older people so they barely did anything! Hardest part was trying to persuade customers to apply for a sears card. I didn't enjoy this job too much that's why i didn't stay long at all.
bad,The people there aren't honest and you barely get any hours. You have to pester people into get credit card AND to sign up for points.
bad,Multitask environment with high potentials of gaining professional and technical growth
bad,"Promotion is dependent upon how hard your manager will puch for you.  Some are good at it, some are not.  Certain departments have the attitude that if you are not happy, then leave.  The current overall atmosphere is gloomy due to all the news and articles in the media."
bad,no raises and no room for advancement  once you know the job its just repetition   no room to grow no $ for knowledge  or seniority
bad,"Working at the Sears-McCain Mall is my top 3 worst employers ever. I work a shift making sure the clothes on the rack are neat and organized; among other apparel duties. The customers are very messy, so you are always busy. Although a few employees requested transfers and sought promoted positions, management hires outside or will contact former employees to return. Management can pull you in several directions, but questions why the tasks are not completed by the end of the shift. For example, a manager will tell you to do one thing, then another will pull you away to work on something else. Management will schedule you a full week then the next week you are barely scheduled hours. Management will film or photograph you on their phones if they perceive you as not working. You've been warned."
bad,"La vente et le service a la clientèle deviennent secondaires, la vente de cartes de crédit est prioritaire pour  l obtention d heures de travail et pour conserver notre poste"
bad,Immediate supervisors/managers were wonderful but as you moved up the management was sub par at best. It was a complaint often heard by many coworkers and even other managers.
bad,"If you want to learn a trade this is were you want to work at, and learn how to work all things in the shop,"
bad,I learned how to communicate with customers. Very active job and lots of cleaning in the departments at the end of the day.
bad,"All in all, I worked there for about 6 years and I hated every minute of it."
bad,"Good place to learn the trade but not a career..typical day:  you have 35 mins to get to your first call no matter how far you have to drive to get there.  then if you need to order a part you have to get permission from two sources then routing will send another tech back to install the part and finish up the call.  The company will try to get out of honoring their own warranties which upsets the customers, which in turn takes out their frustrations on you then the company will repremand you because the customer complained. Now on to the next 12 call that have to be done within the 10 hour work limit...My tech manager actually said that he didn't have to be a tech nor have to know how to repair anything, His job was to manage people......This place is a joke..."
bad,"Folded and put away clothing, cashed people out on the register. I learned customer service, management was ok. My co-workers were friendly, the hardest part of the job was selling credit cards and the most enjoyable part was helping customers."
bad,The employees are the most enjoyable. I have made some good friends here. But the conditions and benefits are not desirable.
bad,"The company itself was based on the ""Customer Experience"" but the customer's were often ignored. There was no really training period, and it was a sink or swim environment. People with questions were often chastised, and if a mistake was made no one was there to help or fix it."
bad,"The 15 hours a week that I worked there I would help customers with finding the perfect appliances for them. If they needed help finding more information about each product I would do so. Also, I would ring customers up if they were ready to check out. Management was never there. When he was there he only cared about the top sellers not the whole team. He did not care about anything other than his bonus at the end of each month and if he did not get it he would yell at the lower selling people. The co-workers were really fun and funny to be around. The hardest part was dealing with the GM. The Enjoyable part was the co-workers"
bad,"Good place to work, but not for sure when company will go under"
bad,"Learned how to handle difficult situations with unruly customers due to faults in devices or services offered. Management had ups and downs depending on the day and manager. Co-workers were all great, all did the best they could to create a team effort. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with company standards plus mixed management standards. Most enjoyable was daily interaction with customers."
bad,"In a typical day at Kmart, I process cash, check, and EFT transactions, lottery transactions, Western Union transactions, credit applications, fishing license sales, and all manner of returns, while also answering phones, greeting guests, and managing the workflow of up to 15 team members."
bad,"The people make the place, and the employees are underpaid and over looked. It was very difficult as a leader to instill happiness and benefits when there was no backing from the company."
bad,it was a alright job need better management. Good second job if you have one
bad,The people there were great but the work environment sucked! They were always on everyone about something. Potentially good money but I still wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
bad,"I load and unload trucks and stock. I stock shelves; build layouts; and move items. Sunday Mornings I place the signs for the weekly ads. I move items as small as a package of nails; as large as a pallet of bottled water. I am currently in charge of three departments: DiY, sports, and automotive. Move items from one backroom location into others or on the floor. Correctly placing new products into new layouts. Preparing items to be return through our loss prevention. Double checking inventory for correct levels and reporting erroneous Levels. General cleaning as needed. Working as a team member to complete the truck in all departments in a timely fashion."
bad,"Log in to work and start taking calls. I learned a lot about customer service and how to listen to customers. Management was alright, coaching was helpful. Co workers were a bit friendly and some were rude and unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was not being able to assist customers the best way possible. The most enjoyable part was being able to assist customers in fixing their appliances and allowing them to vent."
bad,The people that worked there were very intelligent and always willing to help.  The pay was highly commissioned based.  During the slow time it was very hard to make money.
bad,its like being in a prison you even have to ask just to go to the bathroom
bad,"My typical day consists of replenishing store stock, making sure the floor is neat and clean. Providing the best customer service experience."
bad,"This job was nice at first until they started giving me only 6 hours a week. If you're not a good salesman then you probably shouldn't apply to a Sears because you are required to sell credit cards, if you don't don't expect to get very many hours. They were flexible with my school schedule which I did enjoy but other than that I wouldn't want to return."
bad,"They didn't care about their employees. Over worked, under paid."
bad,"I was terminated and really don't understand why, meaning the manager said ""you just need more experience at cashiering"" is my biggest issue with this job. Additionally, I didn't feel that there were members of management to assist me as needed with arising situations. ""Just felt as if I was thrown out there and hoped i made it"""
bad,"As i was only there for 5 months, it is hard to give a comprehensive review. I was not given proper training for the position. This was in part due to my supervisor. She could not train me how to get reports and other information because she did not know how to get that information from the computer system herself. She was also an absent supervisor in that I can count less than 5 times I remember seeing her on the sales floor in her department."
bad,"When there was work it was busy. I learned to communicate with service managers & customers. The management needs a little help, cause they don't quite have an understanding how auto centers operate.the co workers were awesome to work with cause they worked as a team, not individuals. the hardest part of the job was to compete the job with the estimate given cause u never allow enough time for the rusty parts. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on the customers face when you repaired their vehicle"
bad,Sears was the best place I have been employed as far as co-workers. But there are no chance for advancement or raises. Never had a raise the entire time I have been there. Neither do they do evaluations. I did learn a lot about Fine Jewelry during my time there. The hardest part of the job is that rules change from week to week. I never knew what to expect next.
bad,pricing merchandise and stocking floor. preparing for store for sales keeping merchandise stocked. answering phones taking orders over phone. learned that the customer is always right. learned patients is very important when dealing with customers. co-worker were dependable. hardest part of the job holidays and inventory. most enjoyable was raises and employees discounts..
bad,"Work was always busy, and managers were never to be found when they are needed. Poor management. I was a merchandise/receiving associate and I knew how to operate a cash registered even though it wasn't my part of the job. I was doing manager's job for them. About 80% of the manager there don't know what they're doing, or how they are suppose to do their job. I taught my department manager how to operate the kiosk and SNC. I learned how to assemble a Barbeque grill and repair Ratchet tools. From working there I have to say everyone that worked within the Receiving department knew how to work the store a lot better than all other associates because we deal with phone-calls, locate sales merchandise, make sales, operate cash register, repair/assemble merchandise, input customer's information into computer's database, etc. The hardest part of the job is when I have to work alone at my department and take care of everything when no one was schedule to help. Working downstairs and upstairs(there's 2 part of this job), uploading merchandise into vehicle. Everything in one night to assemble 2 barbeque grills, finish 8 pages of merchandise that needs to be fill at sales floor, send merchandise out for service/repair. Managers makes a big fuss when we take our 15 mins break."
bad,"I started working at Sears in August 2012 as a sales associate. Although I really didn't want to work in the appliance department as they had offered, I accepted it anyways because of the commission you had the potential to earn. I mostly enjoyed working in the appliance department and my co-workers were nice and respectful for the time I worked there. I got to learn a lot from the most experience there from appliances to electronics. The hardest part would have to be the competition in the department from it being only commission, but if you were to make a lot of sales or sell higher-end things, you would get way more than minimum wage. You could make up to $1000 a week if you tried (some people did in my department). Management was ok the first few months because of the store manager's inclusive attitude and fairness towards everyone. The new store manager the preceded was just terrible. You could tell that they clearly didn't enjoy the job they were doing and she was out of touch with the employees as well. She thought she was better than everyone who worked there. The management could pay their employees a livable wage instead of $6.25 with commission in some cases, then they have the nerves to lower the commission rates! Sears is going down fast and the management is just trying to get as much money as they can before it happens. Hardly any customers and you expect me to sell something and have high sales figures. The hardest part of the job was just knowing that I wasn't being paid fairly and neither were my co-workers."
bad,"They have a great team working for them but, the do a lot of micromanaging and it makes it hard for advancement, in 2002 their salary cap was only 11.25 an hour and an awful lot of folks would call off, in the winter the warehouse would be cold. in the summer, over 100 degrees in the trailers, I enjoyed working with the men, they were like little boys in big men's bodies. I made an awful lot of friends there"
bad,"This is your typical retail setting. Low pay, no benefits. Entry level job."
bad,"Sears is without a doubt a company on the decline and on the ropes. From the selling of brand name assets, to the shrinking customer base, to the lack of product coming in, Sears has shown me throughout the years that they have essentially given up hope of becoming a force in the retail market again. They treat their employees exactly like a company going out of business as well. Cutting commissions bi-monthly is NOT a way to stimulate sales in store. With a company that fights so hard against us, why would I want to stay?"
bad,"I worked at Sears for more than a year. at first i thought it would be a nice job since i made hourly plus commission pay. It was not all i thought it would be. I would have to stock the shelves and do inventory work even though i was on commission based salary. I had no alternative, i either did what they asked me to or i would get fired. They also play with the statistics, they had employees placed in easy departments that did not have a high goal while others would be placed in harder one and always almost fail."
bad,"The leadership of the company continually makes bad decisions that the intelligent employees don't believe in and it shows in the culture. "
bad,The hardest parts of the job was obtaining credit applications and lack of steady work schedule.  The management at the Polaris location was awsome and a pleasure to work with.  I did learn to work the cash register.
bad,A typical day at Sears is just helping customers out in anyway that I can. I ring customers up while also being able to joke with them. Some of the management was rude but had there days when they were nice. I enjoyed my manager because she understood what it meant to be a college student and work at the same time. My co-workers were all in the same predicament as each other so we all tried to help each other out the best way we can. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and the most enjoyable part is being able to have fun on the job.
bad,"This position was very difficult to make money because it was strictly commission and when business was slow, it was hard to survive."
bad,"A typical day at work is very focused on make your goals for the day.  "
bad,"Firstly, let me say I was recruited to Sears. I didn't seek the Assistant Manager position out that I was recruited for. The first problem began at my interview when I went over compensation with the Store Manager. I was told I that Assistant Managers starting out received a minimum amount. When my papers were drawn up by the recruiter, the salary on them was $5000 less than what the Store Manager told me. The recruiter said she needed the papers back right away, and though she was normally able to answer my emails within minutes, when I told her I had questions, she told me she would get back to me after I she received the papers back with my electronic signature. I waited for her to respond. She never did. I sent a reminder email the following week and she said she had responded- even though she didn't. My salary was never resolved, and the sad part is that another Assistant Manager who started two weeks after me received the amount I was told I would get. The salary I received is not competitive with Walmart, Target, or any other big box retailers- the salaries of which I have knowledge of."
bad,I have been with this company for 2 months and am at my wits end.  There is no consistency between stores and management is absent except to point out your store's poor performers.  I have not been trained and am expected to work alone without anyone available to answer questions.  This is a set up for misfills and poor patient satisfaction.  I advise against joining this company.
bad,"A typical day at work is clean/dust off tables, fixtures, maniquins, redress maniquins, make sure merchandise on tables and isles facing mall entrances are presentiable,size, and colorized. I learned that i am the ""eyes & ears' for the store manager. The managers at sears was poor, they don't do their jobs when store manager is not there. My co-workers are great people, they can help me with anything i ask of them. The hardest part of the job would be asking other managers to do their job. My job as a visual specialist is to help the managers, not to do their job for them, like setting the floor/layouts for new merchandises. Is unfair that i am doing their jobs while they are chit chatting with other managers in the office. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing returning customers with happy purchases."
bad,A good company with great benefits but limited career advancement potential.
bad,"mauvaise transmission des renseignement, manque de personnelle aux service à la clientèle, trop de ventes de perdue par manque d'infomation"
bad,"Sears is a terrible place to work. The only thing management cares about is their quotas and if you'd gotten credit cards, or memberships, or store to home items, etc."
bad,une experience enrichissante et de l experience acquise dans le service a la clientele peu de possibilite de developpement atteint le niveau max de supervision  des bons collaborateurs aucun aspect réellement difficile j adore travail avec le public et beaucoup de facilite a gerer ce genre de travail
bad,You are promised something while the offer is made; however you never actually get what was promised - My personal Experience!
bad,Sears is a company with great potential.  Stores do not get the support from upper management to meet or exceed companies goals.
bad,"My time with the company started well but now under new management a very biased atmosphere exists within the company. The chances for advancement are few and unrewarding. The overall business culture is ""get ahead at the expense of others"". The supervisor that I work for is the only reason that I've stayed so long. A typical day at work consists of me replenishing stock and checking material levels. The hardest part of the day is when I have to check the accuracy of the pricing for merchandise, because of the amount of merchandise that I have to check. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I build a large amount of merchandise or display for the floor. "
bad,"This place was horrible all the way up to the store manager. The other employees were very cool, but those managers.....smh. I think Sears as a whole has the wrong view on customers. They want you to basically harass customers with all these questions about applying for credit cards and other non important, miscellaneous stuff. The air was always broken in the mens department...so they told us...but was very cool on the other side of the store. The store manager has bad communication with his employees. Instead of him talking to you directly if he sees an issue, he goes to the other managers and let them talk to you."
bad,"I did learned a lot about Craftman tools and fitness equipment, and most of the employees were easy to get along with. Unfortunately, those are the only two positive things I can take away from the experience. Management was unresponsive: scheduling me for days I had told them were unavailable, not providing necessary materials to sell the protection plans (info sheets that showed in writing what they did and didn't cover), creating a culture of distrust were some people would steal each others sales without repercussion.    "
bad,I was initially excited to work for Sears....now not so much
bad,"I would come in check what department I was assigned to making sure that all the merchandise with in that department is all folded properly, on proper hangers nothing on the floors any empty displays etc., check the department for fitting room cleanliness, fitting room merchandise that was tried on that needs to go back to sales floor. Checking for customers that may need help with finding specific merchandise on sales floor or if they need me to bring it to them at the fitting rooms. Check the sales floor stock room see if there is anything in there that can be put out on sales floor. Check cash wrap area for cleanliness and I would pretty much keep repeating this behavior all day staying busy."
bad,I loved sears until 6 months ago when my job was being threatened by not only my boss but other coworkers.
bad,"only good thing about the job is u mae good money. if u have family they do not care, u have to work every weekend which means no outside life other then work! its good for young college students or people with no family, they dont care if u or ur family is sick they will write u up. if u need to take off and dont have the time build up they automatically deny it! oh and only 30 minute lunch even if u work 8 hr or 12 hours 30 mins lunch! "
bad,Sears is a dying company desperately trying to modernize. They place too much focus on technology and credit and forget that they first need to attract customers to push these advancements upon. The management was frequently stressed and therefore more of a parent than a boss (spent more time disciplining than teaching/leading). My co-workers were friendly but often talked badly about the company. I learned that a job with a dying company means a workforce with dying morale. 
bad,When I worked there management was always moody which in turn turned everyone moody how can employees be happy if management is not happy
bad,I started with the company before its merger with KMart. The culture was amazing. There were associates who made their career in sales there and a decent living. Good benefits and up to 15% match on 401k. Even stock options that were at 199 per share! There were all eliminated in the coming years.
bad,"If its not slow its fun, learned a lot of things about department, management is usually very good. Co-workers come and go, hardest part of the job is the slow times, Most enjoyable part is when people come back and tell you they love their product."
bad,The best part about the job is the unlimated over time. It is not horrible but it's probably not a place to start a career if you are a goal oriented person.
bad,"A typical day at work was to solicit for new sales accounts, photograph sessions. Co workers are not very motivated because they only make min wage and have little drive to succeed because they are given little to no training. Many people do not realize that this is a vendor inside Sears and is not owned by Sears. They are also the same company that owns Wal Mart Picture Me. District Manager is not customer oriented and cares only about the bottom line as does the company itself. They do not explain coupons or offers and really mislead customers. The employees are accessed not on there photography skills but solely on there sales. Most of employees are let go if they do not averagely sell above one hundred dollars per sale. This company does not stand by there products nor do they show any compassion for their customers. The employees are trained to make there customers feel bad if they do not spend enough money."
bad,Depending on the shift I receive I will open or close the registers at the beginning or end of the day. I assist customers by finalizing transactions and sometimes filling out credit card applications. I help out in the shoe department however I can. I also help customers find products they're looking for.
bad,"I worked for this company and used every opportunity to learn and develop skills to use elsewhere. Working for this company I learned to be a leader, how to thrive, managerial skills, and the ability to work under pressure while making decisions without the help of management."
bad,Sears is lacking the technology for its employees to do their job. Although the management is good on a whole I feel as thought they do not run the company effectively.
bad,"Manage overall twelve different co workers always going over new training material and making sure they have the knowledge and understanding of the job, I learned patience for teaching, Management was fair but firm. The co workers were hard workers and maintained as one unit. The hardest part of the job was having to write someone up or to hold someone accountable for there mistakes and to correct the problem. The most enjoyable part of the day was when we came together as a team."
bad,If you want to learn there is a lot you can learn here.It started as a startup and since then it is growing well as the employees are having good expertise knowledge. Also the management is good and helps a lot
bad,i work all day doing stuff im not payed to do and im not payed to do what i do now . i am suppose to be payed 8.50 and hes got me as a cash register just so he dont have to pay me my extra cash
bad,The job itself was fun the management up the the regional manager just wasn't all together
bad,"A typical day at work would be me coming and unloading the inventory truck, as well as putting the necessary items that belonged on the floor out. I also dealt with customer service and minor retail services."
bad,Working for sears is very challenging for the management team. We are asked to do a large number of things usually a day with little or no notice. The compensation is the lowest in our area with no raises having been given in over 4 years. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer contact and the freedom to mercahndise and rest departments/floors. Upper level management is also a plus.
bad,A typical day at work was ringing people up and answer everyday customer service questions. Cleaning my cash wrap and making sure everything was clean around me.
bad,the best part about sears in the appliances department was the flexibility. the managers were unorganized and never complemented any of the workers for our proven results.
bad,"Typically as a cashier, we were given daily quotas to meet in sales of credit card applications along with our normal duties such as handling customer complaints, payments, refunds, and transactions. The sales of credit card applications are pushed hard and it made me uncomfortable how pushy I was supposed to be. I would usually feel very guilty, but had to ask every single customer the same thing. The redundancy of the ""ask every customer"" sales pitch would drain me by the end of the shift especially on a holiday. On top of cashier duties, it was typical to also help the Merchandising Assistants with clothes from the fitting rooms, straighten merchandise on racks and shelves, and clean. I learned how to multi-task a lot in this position and it was expected of you to do so also. I had many managers and supervisors to answer and often was given assignments from one or more at a time in different departments within multiple days. I learned how to set priorities and be more assertive because of this. My co-workers were constantly changing, so I didn't get to know many of them. The hardest part of my job was having so many managers and supervisors with all different managerial styles and a lack of communication among them. It really added unnecessary stress to the work. Before I knew it, I had projects piling up and they are wondering why nothing is getting done."
bad,Can be a fun place to work if you make it. However long hours with very little reward. little to no chance of a bonus or raise.
bad,"Start a day by checking sales ads, and printing out planograms for the day, week, weekend or holidays. A lot of customer service. I assisted customers. Ran cash registers. Stocked shelves. Set up seasonal, holiday, and weekly displays. Ordered merchandises. Did refunds and returns. Answered phone calls. Used hand held machines for ordering merchandises and inventories. Cleaned and dusted. Dealt with vendors with ordering, verifying orders and merchandises."
bad,vendeuse et rangement des vêtements
bad,SHC strains under its leadership team. There is no consistent vision and the work environment is very difficult.
bad,asnwered inbound escalated calls for sears delivery. created exchange work orders and compensated customers for products that were delivered damaged
bad,- Selling the customers to sears credit card
bad,"Roles are always changing. With the changing of upper management, things get shifted around sometimes without much consideration of impact with the business or with the employees. Support personnel are expected to be highly trained with little compensation. Salary is not structured to experience or job demands. They do try and work with scheduling, and they do try and be supportive with home life situations, but to a point."
bad,"Low wages, rule changes every week, managers didn't really care about employees."
bad,all was well except noone in hr knows what thy are doing.my manager and district manager were great but from there up sucks
bad,Currently all efforts are based on customer satisfaction such as:
bad,"taking photos, working with kids, Showing pictures to costumers and editing them"
bad,I started my Security Career at Sears- thank you
bad,Mostly customer service is your main priority. Day is spent as CEM where you are responsible for entire operations of auto center. Performance manage is a must and completed daily.
bad,"Your work typicaly started at home untill you recieved and email early that morning where your route would be. I learned a whole lot about Heating and Airconditioning that I didn't know about. Management was pretty slim, not enough. The co-worker generaly were the ones keeping you motivated. The consultations were never in the same area and the territory was too big. I enjoyed the most was the in home interaction with the customers."
bad,Sears is a great company but its not a great place to work. They work their employers to hard for little pay.
bad,"I signed up to work m,w,th,f and s between 7-5 pm and willing to work extra hours when needed. but they changed my schedule to 3:30- 9pm . I am a single mother and child care ends at 6:00pm I currently in school working on my Bachelor Degree and they told me they would be flexible with my schedule. They were not they forced me to quit! not a good place to work if you need stablity and good pay."
bad,Not much job security as people get let go routinely. No pay raises in several years. The managers are not to blame. It's poor leadership from the top
bad,"Weekly motivation sales meeting was helpful in motivating workers when dealing with sales, clients etc.  Working with Sears  sometimes meant long hours on the road driving to remote locations. Companies reputation was always in a constant state star of flux"
bad,"I can see why they are loosing money left and right, they refuse to change.  What they keep in the stores are old and stale.  The people that work at corporate are old and stale, no new ideas flowing, not able to recruit the best and brightest.  CEO refuses to invest in revitalizing stores."
bad,"Extremely difficult and challenging work environment, but many good people are fighting for survival"
bad,Turnos completos mal pagados por que sólo son por Comisión. Y a mi parecer esto esta fuera de la ley deberían tener más accesibilidad para dobles turnos. No pagan tiempo extra y tampoco te apoyan con el transporte cuando sales tarde de las ventas nocturnas y no les importa la seguridad ni laboral ni familiar. A mi me asaltaron y jamás hicieron nada y fue cuando salí tarde por laboral ahí.
bad,"Cold leads, one leg leads 100 miles to drive one way for a no show"
bad,I was with Sears for over 18 yrs. I basically liked working there. Only real reason I gave these rating was because Sears constantly is in financial trouble and threaten to close stores all the time. They have lost a lot of great employees because of their continuous uncertain future.
bad,"The job was pretty much what you would expect of a department store position except that the store was very short staffed and had high turnover, so staff would sometimes have one whole half of the store to themselves with little help from management. Direction from management was contradictory and they were not welcoming to questions. Credit card sales targets were unreasonable resulting in angry customers at staff being too pushy or angry management at staff not pushing enough. Coworkers were friendly and enjoyable but never really together on the floor."
bad,"I didn't get enough hours at Sears, they give you a lot of work to do in little time and if you have questions. They write you up for it, I wanted a promotion. But they didn't give me enough hours."
bad,"Poor Management, too many changes with poor results. Not enough communication. No training at all for new employees, only the one at the system with is too confusing."
bad,"Sears is a very easy retail  work space where you can gain experience such as cashiering ,sales, warehouse, and even security. It is usually pretty slow and calm but a lot can be learned here."
bad,"My time at Sears was short-lived, as the store received the news of its May closure in February. During the closing process, things were very hectic. I was still considered a trainee so I wasn't really impacted."
bad,"I was hired as a softlines assistant and ended up becoming a cashier as well. Some managers where nice, but some made the shifts miserable. I understand that pushing credit is essential for a failing business to thrive, but sometimes I became so fed up with the manager I didn't ask customers to sign up for credit on purpose. Nobody worked there- I believe on an evening 2:30-6:30 shift, there would be one manager and one person on the floor in my department. So most of my 4-hour shifts I didn't get a 15. I put in my two weeks just before the end of July, but one day I felt so close to heat exhaustion I just up and quit. The entire store had no air conditioner and I was working in dark, sales appropriate attire while on a medication that greatly increases the risk of heat exhaustion. I'm grateful for this experience because it taught me a great deal about patience and completing tasks that I have no desire to."
bad,Stretched to thin. My last 3 months as the store manager I worked 30 days straight due to only having 3 employees besides myself. They would not hire an assistant for me because they were closing and hadn't yet told us.
bad,Too many software and program issues that were problems for employees and customers that required too many supervisor or 1-800 calls to be fixed. These made customer service terrible and associate frustration.
bad,"•Long hours"
bad,It was a good experience to learn retail. Showed proper stocking and how and were to put things. The employees were fun to work with. Thought me to work with customers better. And to interact with people better
bad,I had a great manager and loved being out and about but what was expected for the same as a fast food chain was hard to take in. All support is overseas. Unreal expectations.
bad,"Hardest part was barley any help "
bad,"when in holiday season, managers and the short become a little hostile due to the sears corporations expectations, which ultimately makes work more stressful and seemingly makes the days go faster."
bad,"never got any help from management, only coworkers"
bad,"Was a pretty straight forward job, you get what you work for. The product base offered limitation of commission opportunities though. If you weren't selling a tv essentially you weren't making realistic money."
bad,"Sears has went through alot of trails to figure out the best course of action at the cheapest way available, Sears then started to choose quantity over quality which deterred customers making it hard to make sales."
bad,Long term associate at SHC.  Worked with some great people over the years.  The financial burdens the Company was a tough environment to work in.  Not knowing what the future holds was taxing on everyone.
bad,"While working at Sears can be fun and u will have the opportunity to learn different skills from different departments, this is your common retail job. Some managers are good other you'll want to bang your head off a wall (or there's) by the end of your shift.. for the most part customers will be customer and you will hone your CS skills in positions here. Benefits can be okay but a little expensive. Once you can get off the floor and in a management position things get better so shoot for that."
bad,"Slow paced store, unfortunately most stores have closed or are in the process of closing.  No room for advancement, training bare minimum, mostly learn as you go"
bad,"Work life balance good.  Due to deteriorating business, opportunities for improvement became increasingly difficult.  High staff churn resulted in many project delays and work stoppage."
bad,"A typical day at work would be going in and looking at the daily schedule to see where in the store you would be working. The register that they choose to schedule you for is based on performance on how many sears cards you get customers to apply for. Anytime I would request days off, paid time off would never be an option. Minimum wage was the pay. Getting people to sign up for sears cards helped, but its definitely more for people that have no major bills to pay like teenagers."
bad,"Sears isn't doing the best right now, and I don't really have a personal grudge towards any of my managers at all but they really weren't doing a good job. I heard a lot of my co workers talk about the ""good old days"" when sears was a great company to work for and salespeople could make up to six figures. Its not like that anymore, the store is completely dead if you work in home improvement or mattresses don't expect too many sales with big warranties because people have no faith the company will survive long enough to honor them. The managers are clearly stressed out and will take it out on the workers, I have been cursed out on the sales floor before for going in the stock room to answer an important personal phone call and have been talked down to for not getting a warranty on a sale when i did everything i was supposed to do to get it and the customer still would not budge."
bad,"When I first started at Sears it was a good place to work after they  tried to merge Sears with Kmart thing went down hill quickly"
bad,Started with Sears after working for another hardware retailer being told that I had great ideas and then manager went for his training.  Came back and I was doing everything wrong.
bad,"People I worked with were great(family)!   Company itself was terrible!! The company does not care for their employees, dedication or loyalty!  Leaves you hanging!! Too many inconsistencies."
bad,"Not the best. The managers are okay, some better than others. The customers are terrible. They expect too much out of you. They don't even have an employee discount. Not the best place to work, but it is a job."
bad,I left in 2005. The culture stunk after the KMart merger. It has continued to spiral downward. The work-life  balance for district GM's was non-exitent.
bad,Working at this job was a learning experience in that it was my first retail experience at any store. As i worked in other retail stores i see that this store prepared me to work in busier stores as it taught me to deal with difficult customers and how to give good customer service. On a typical day employees that were cashiers would ring customers up and then maintain the surrounding area if no customers were near. You would also be required to ask customers to sign up for credit cards while you would receive paycheck credit for every card you signed up. The culture was very slow but the employees were friendly since there was not much going on. The managers were also not friendly or encouraging. The days would get busy a few times per day but not much. The hardest part of the job was signing customers up for credit cards and the most enjoyable part was interacting with friendly customers.
bad,"It was a starter job, I was just a commission sales associate so I had to learn quickly how to help less than helpful people. There is a high turnover so it can be stressful, but the discount was really nice."
bad,They will be remembered as the company who gave me the oppurtunity as a civilian to find my career path and before they left the chance to be trained by 20+ year appliance repair veterans who have mentored me to be a strong Kitchen Laundry Technician of the appliance repair trade.
bad,"Handling shipments, orders , and returns in parts department. Very slow paced . Did not seem that organized , alot of turn over. Not enough work to do to stay business during the day. Alot of change in management."
bad,I enjoyed working at Sears but the fact that you only make minimum wage there did not satisfy me. There are no raises there and you basically have to rely on credit apps as extra compensation.
bad,i really loved workin for sears portrait studio 1 of my favorite jobs the only thing i did not like was when they filed for bankrupcy they did not give any notice
bad,Sears is a company that is on the downward trend. I can say I meet a lot of nice people working for them. My typical day included being given a route to run for the day and running it to the best of my ability.
bad,"Even if my coworkers were 50 year old+ adults, all it was was cliques that consisted of fighting, talking smack, segregation, etc. I don't blame them for acting like this, though. The only reason people were so childish was because there was always a competition for sales. Working for 100% COMMISSION WITH NO BASE PAY does that to people. "
bad,Sears was a great company  to work for just like any other  job out it had its many positives as well as some negative  things as well. I do wish that they would have paid alot better  especially  being in a job that was 100% based on the net sales we made  no base pay just a 2% to 8%  commission  depending  on the product we sold .Also they could have shown alot more appreciation by saying please and thank you alot more
bad,Worked there in the 80 and 90 was a great company to work for. open to movement and suggestion. made a quality wage. the new ceo hired in the 2000 was a joke and the company went down quickly and its kind of sad to see the company as a shell of it once was
bad,Sears was the worst place to work in my entire life of working. I would not recommend someone over 18 to work there. It is like an afternoon job for high school of first time job holders.
bad,"I worked as an in home appliance technician.  The focus was certainly not on customer satisfaction. Outdated equipment,  outdated means of communication, ect.slowed down getting  the customers up and running. Sometimes having to return to the home several times that spanned months, at times, to fix an appliance. I was also expected to push sales on those who obviously didnt have the means or get penalized . It was obvious the $ was the bottom line. Maybe that's why financial woes  haunt Sears. It could be a great job with a little modernization and customer focus."
bad,un lugar para empezar a conseguir objetivos laborales.
bad,Buen ambiente laboral motivación con juntas diarias
bad,The company has been struggling for many years now.  We go through rounds of layoffs every quarter so its hard to stay motivated.  We're also expected to do the same amount of work with half the employees. Too many people pointing fingers and not enough people to actually do the work.
bad,Fast paced environment. Had to deal with unpleasant people. a lot of standing around. Arranging stock neatly. Not a fun place to work.Staff are friendly.
bad,"Great people, and good work/life balance. However, continual layoffs and concerns of ongoing business viability is a constant cloud that overshadows everything."
bad,The job itself wouldn’t be hard if we had working equipment & hours. But we don’t. There aren’t enough people & there is way too much to do. The people are great corporate is horrible.
bad,attend morning sales meeting. motivate staff to acheive daily sales goals and visual for the day. discuss props and display fixtures for the week. Lack of attendace from staff was a challenge.
bad,Sears Holding Corporation has some good sides with several bad sides. The community and individual work groups are fantastic. However there seems to be a notion from highest management that groups should compete against each other. The high stress from never knowing if the company will still exist next month is constantly hung over you.
bad,"If everything works as it should be (devices and coworkers), the days are fantastic and easy going. However that is usually not the case. The most necessary device, the SNC, suffers from disconnecting from the printer, apple device, and wi-fi (to connect to the printer), freezing, refusal to scan, and a short battery life. All of this in addition to the lack of availability of the devices as many either go missing, are dead, or are sent out for repairs. "
bad,It is not a fun place to work.The atmosphere is caustic. You are always afraid of big brother looking over your shoulder belittling you.It is very stressful.
bad,"As the Operations Manager I was in charge of the day-to day operations of the building.  I was in charge of the following:"
bad,"They never increased salary from minimum wage for regular cashier and floor associates.  Scheduling was often last minute.  In-store management did their best, but was often hampered by corporate constantly changing their mind on how they wanted the floor set, etc."
bad,"Sears is not a very good place to work. There is no benefits, No paid time off, Cheated out of pay. Was told $10 an hr for first 2 weeks until i learned the ropes. then pay would go up to 13 I still have not recieved my raise everytime the manager is confronted about it there is always another excuse. I dont see how that is fair considering I do his job while he sits at home and collects Salary"
bad,"If management liked you, you had a chance to work your way up. Managers were not professional. Cussed all the time, talked behind everyone's back. If you didn't get customers to sign up for their rewards or credit cards, you were humiliated."
bad,"While I enjoyed my job greatly and took pride in my work I found the overall management of the company to be unbearable. Some days it felt like it didn't matter what I did right because upper management only looks at the negative. They do not create motivated employees. With frustrated employees and too many bean counters tt's not hard to see why the company is going out of business."
bad,"I loved my shop because of the people I worked with and the customers. Outside of that, I would have left long time ago. About every year or so they change the pay schedule and present it to you in a way that makes you think you'll be getting more, but you have to do some crazy math to figure out you're actually loosing money and to make it up you have to work more hours and hope you don't get in trouble for putting in extra overtime."
bad,"Working for Sears at this point is an entire luck of the draw scenario. With their profits in freefall and upper management not knowing (or seeming to care about) how to fix it, long term employment is not something to bet the farm on."
bad,Poor management. If you weren’t getting people to fill out their credit card applications they would cut your house. Once i only got 5 people to fill card applications out and the next week i only received 15hrs because of it.
bad,Sears is a good place for someone right out of school or still living at home with their parents . someone who doesn't have many bills to pay .the pay is not that great at all . manager was super nice . co-workers were super chill . but the money......... Not good. And 20 hrs a week .
bad,"Was great when I first started years ago. As problems developed it became very stressful. You had to multi-task and a lot was put on your plate and you were responsible for getting it all done, though it was clearly impossible. The management most of the time didnt lift a finger unless we were having an important visit. Most of the employees were very nice and were willing to help you out if it was possible and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. I have learned a lot from Sears and developed many good talents."
bad,This place will not hire you full time but is more than willing to work their employees full time hours. Management is less than desirable to work with and the store is severely understaffed.
bad,I wouldnt recommend any long term career paths here and they dont pay well. This job got me through college but I left as soon as I found a better job once I graduated
bad,Very cheap place to work for. A lot of repetitive assignments and expected to do it as quickly as possible because there was always something else to do.
bad,Sears was a fast paced and changing place to work.  Technical advances were happening every day.   I had worked there for thirty years and have done multiple positions.  the hardest part of the jobs(s) was I never knew if I would be training an associate or working in a different department. The most enjoyable part of my jobs were meeting different people and learning new jobs.
bad,"Sears Roebuck used to have a proud tradition of quality tools, that a sales associate could be proud to sell.  Outsourcing has led to shoddy products.  Being a sales associate there required a person to sacrifice their conscience in the name of trying to meet their sales quota and get commissions.  Typically the day would prove mostly slow as the reputation of Sears and Craftsman suffered from the tools made now not living up to the former quality of product that customers would bring in to trade for tools.  Management would ask associates to continually be cleaning if they weren't with a customer, which was often, and the departments got cleaned so much that there was rarely any real work to do.  Along with cleaning were promoting credit applications for the Sears Mastercard or the Barclay Sears Card  if they couldn't be accepted for the Citibank card, which was pushed in a very competitive manner between sales associates.  Failure to meet quotas for the high interest credit applications resulted in shaming at morning meetings which were held to show departments who did the best the day before in Sales and the warranties for Sears products, and took up a good chunk of time.  Supposedly it was to promote team cohesion, but in practice it resulted more in departmental shaming.  The techniques I learned there in sales will serve me in good stead for further customer services in later jobs.  The hardest and worst parts of the jobs were to try and convince customers to get extended warranties on products that weren't well made and in trying to get them to sign up for the Sears Cards."
bad,"I worked there for years, having come from a similar job at another store. They offered minimum wage and the only time we got raises is when the state raised the minimum wage. They expected us to do many different jobs for such low pay.  I even had to train my supervisor - twice!"
bad,"Sears was a nice job start but I'm really trying to push forward in the work force.  The hours were inconsistent and the wages were low, no benefits. The only thing I'll take from Sears is the work experience."
bad,"Most days were very long, extremely stressful and most of the management team looked at ways to ""appear"" as they were addressing long standing operational and morale problems but it was very ineffective. Three of the top managers in the building had a combined tenure of almost 90 years and yet neither individual was really good at their jobs. It seemed like a good old boy network. One Operations Manager was in his position because he knew the V.P. of Operations from another company."
bad,Working at Sears generally was enjoyable however being in sales the pressure by management was unsupportive and hostile.  This caused issues with fellow employees.  Pressure to perform sales requirements also pressured the customers relentlessly which may be one reason Sears is a failing Co.
bad,When i first started at sears it was a honor to work in the appliance department you had to work hard and prove yourself now they will put anyone there just to fill hours and now there are too many people
bad,"I no longer am employed by Sears,  I enjoyed my job and the flexibility my managers gave to me.  the hardest part of my job was setting up the mattress dept. when the new stock came in. I was able to cross over to different dept."
bad,I worked at Sears because they gave me the hours I needed. A lot of good people work there.  I'm thankful for all I learned.   However it was not a place I would want to work long term.  Five years was more than enough.
bad,"I worked at Kmart for a year and a half. I barely got hours and money and yet I was training almost all of the cashiers.  Not worth it, just miss the people that I worked with.  The big issue was when we would be on break and they would try to cut it short because they finally got customers."
bad,"I was work the jewelry department, everything was commission based and I was not making enough hourly, unless I made a sell on the jewelry plus the insurance."
bad,"Sears was just very unorganized. Sometimes they forgot to make the schedule, there were times I would work an 8 hour shift with no breaks, you were assigned a specific register and then they would change you last minute, little to no respect, etc. But Sears is closing and will be no longer soon."
bad,Sears was my first job. The job was easy and pretty laid back but they cut my pay in half and made it commission based. Causing my paycheck to drop because the low customer traffic. I left because Sears is going out of business.
bad,Sears was not a great place to work as I dealt with many management issues. There were managers who did not seem to know their responsibilities. Bad Job
bad,Sears is struggling to stay relevant and they have closed many stores in recent years. The CEO does not seem intent on running this once proud company as a retailer.
bad,"quite days, no benefits, not many customers, didn't have many hours, pay wasn't good, great co-workers to work with."
bad,Way too big workloads for very limited hours. Scheduling at 75% to cut back on payroll means less cleaning and timely processing. Having worked there for 5 plus years I know what and how to do my job. I had moved to all positions up to supervisor due to unrealistic goals such as a credit app every half hour. I turned down management due to low balling pay. Because of my work and experience they actually created a Full Time position for just me but that meant I had a workload meant for at least 3 associates. Pay was okay considering had no manager responsibility but was still utilized as such on occasions due to lack of knowledge of current managers and call outs.
bad,"While at Sears for 9 years, one of the only positive work experiences I had was that my schedule did allow me to at least be home to pick up my kids from the bus within a reasonable amount of time.  However, we were never allowed any sick days--you get docked for being sick, therefore people would always come to work sick and get others sick as well.  They tried to make us happy and give us food sometimes, but the work environment was stressful, always being asked to do more than what we were able and never being compensated fairly for that extra work.  Overall, I would not recommend a position at Sears."
bad,"Job did not have good work ethics, it was a every man for themselves work environment everyone was out to get each other management did not care for the employees and rarely any room for growth in the company."
bad,Started off as a great job and was happy to come to. As time went by the management seemed to go downhill. Management skills were not the best and employees were treated poorly.
bad,The staff was pleasant. The management left a little to be desired. There was no raises for years. Staff would work hard and not be appreciated by the manager.
bad,Working at Sears was probably the hardest job I've ever had. I went from being a Cashier to being a Hard-lines merchandise associate. Selling credit was not easy and not what I enjoyed doing. Management was always changing rules and always creating new work for us to do on top up of our responsibilities. We were always understaffed and we all were picking up extra shifts for the lack of employees.
bad,It was hard to get communication from Regional management and higher. District management would help the best that they could although they could not get expidited correspondance from upper Management.
bad,"My job let me be behind the scenes, which I liked, little supervision, but it's the same job everyday, which becomes stagnant at times. Not all managers are consistent with their dealings with employees, which shows favoritism.  They don't use the annual review scale properly."
bad,I cooked alot of food and served and rang the register and cleaned the lobby and made the salads and sandwiches. Did not like the manager that worked my shift.
bad,"Honestly, the store is falling apart and the management cant keep employees for longer than a month. the lack of employees that are well trained make everyone else's jobs a lot more stressful. If they paid better / guaranteed more hours/ had benefits for part-time employees, people would stay and things would run a lot smoother."
bad,You can make good money selling appliances at sears. The only issue is that the news about the company's financial state seems to be hurting business.
bad,"excelente capacitacion, no sueldo base solo comiciones, los gerentes de area solo piensan en sus bonos y aumentan la carga de trabajo, si hay perdidas te quieren cobrar las mismas de tu sueldo."
bad,"It started as a great place to work.  After the bankruptcy and the merger, we restructured and started a different workplace culture.  It was a difficult environment as financial obligations weren't met by the company."
bad,"This job was not one of my favorite jobs, management and company control could have been better. The pay for work ratio definitely needed to improve. The entire system needs overhauled."
bad,"My position (Cashier Lead) was terminated in February 2017. I enjoyed being a Cashier Lead very much. I was part of management and enjoyed being so, but after losing that position things changed. The changes made were not good for the members. I chose to leave due to how the members were being treated."
bad,I wish we were doing as good as we did in the 90's.  I started with Sears in 1989 and we no longer have the traffic that I'm used to drive sales and personal income.
bad,The wages are to low. Try to work for Wal-Mart or pretty much anywhere else. It's a job for the younger people but even then try for management or your wasting time.
bad,"Keep up to date on appliances and help pick out the right appliances for the customers needs. Keep the work area clean and make sure the prices where correct. Speak with vendors about new features  and benefits. Interpersonal skills include problem solving, stocking shelves and working with the team to fulfill department goals."
bad,Long hours with a short break is hard to compensate for the organization of the staff and floor keep. Good for first time job seekers. Endurance and dedication however is learned and kept for the future and is a vital asset.
bad,Constant driving. Very large territory. Not enough project coordinators to cover territory. May drive 250- 300 miles daily w/o time for lunch in between appointments. Computer system needs updating. System requires daily updates that may take up to an a hour before beginning the work day on the road.
bad,Didn't really have anything new or exciting things to do. very quite workplace. unless yiu like folding clothes all day than this is the perfect job for ylou.
bad,Easy work with good co-workers. Generally understaffed during busy hours. Management is willing to help out when needed. Best part of the job is helping out the customers.
bad,"- Three shifts in Support Project. "
bad,i worked a lot by myself with no help when i needed it.i learned about stocking and i liked the people i worked with. but i didn't like that i had to work by myself when customers came to pick up there stuff.
bad,"Life at Sears was always challenge  at best , They  would cut hours back under the legal limit and tell you it was the way it was. You always had to remind them of the law and call HR which was ever elusive . You would call and it was be administered  by people in another country  that were barely understanding the American language. They would schedule you and ask you to stay after a lot. If you did the job Good, they would work you to death while others came and left as a leisure stay at a Country Club. The employees that did the least would basically run the show .It was a Zoo. It was surrealistic "" Beware""."
bad,"The work is so interesting when you like to solve problems and interact with different people, but'''' the tech Managers and top level only care about the protection appliance you can sell and the time you send fixing something not in the customer satisfaction and the company prestige that was really something so important in the past them they all the time are forcing you and make you fell really so bad in spite you develop your job in a professional manner, beside some time you can fell the racism from your supervisors if your origin is from another place of course if you are already a US citizen"
bad,"I enjoyed the job, it was easy and we were able to take our time to assist each customer. The work other than that was easy, just a lot of downtime due to slow traffic. We found out in June our store would be closing with no warning and management didn't provide us with the ability to transfer to another store. There was no compensation for employees who had been with the company less than a year. Management could use better training on how to be managers and how the open door policy works."
bad,"My job was to lead my team. I also was responsible for productivity, sales, profit and gross margin. The customer is always right was Sears motto."
bad,"The job was pretty easy I order filled, shipped, and received packages. I was pretty much every where, The job was very routine it wasn't hard at all the management was horrible. If we didn't make our numbers every one in the building gets blamed for it when the company was really unorganized as a whole. That's why I am looing for a better opportunity, as of January 12th ill be laid off. The Company is closing down."
bad,"The managers here are very unreasonable, lazy, and have an inadequate amount of communication skills required to run a business. They hire way to many people for certain positions and leave other positions with a very small number of people. Then they force you to work in a job field which is out of your contract and far from what you applied to do."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody that gets stress easily. The job it's self is very simple, and easy to learn. The only problem is the managers."
bad,"This is a data entry job, therefore if you like keying then it will be a perfect job for you. The hardest part of this job is getting unsatisfied customers and the enjoyable part is the relationship with co-workers"
bad,"* The management was not supportive of the employees at all and applied rules that drove bad behavior for the company"
bad,"Working at Sears was very stressful. The customers were always unhappy, mainly with the home appliance department (i.e. refrigerators, stoves, washer and dryers). The mangers and supervisors were not trained properly to run the store. Fellow associates called off all the time which left me being the only cashier throughout the whole store my entire shift."
bad,"It's an easy job to have. Some days staff is low. Cashiers get ""beat up"" (lose hours) for not meeting daily credit goals. Entry level pay sucks! But The discount is the best thing if you're a shopper. Needs to sell better brands that people want... Then the few good things people want cost way too much!"
bad,It was a decent first job glad I did it to have experience with retail and customer service. Typical work day was very slow they don't get much business on the weekdays so everything is very laid back.
bad,There are no raises given for lower level employees and managers. Bonuses are not guaranteed. High price for benefits. I stayed for the people.
bad,Very unorganized. Minimum wage pay for doing a lot of work. The location is good. Hours are flexible. It can get really overwhelming at times due to a lot of different reasons.
bad,"Good management but very very low pay. Vision and direction changes every year which makes it harder to stay focused. Benefits are very bad. No bonus, high cost for medical insurance."
bad,minimum wage and really hard for you to become a full time employee with few benefits. Always have different rules that may overthrow older rules. Always asked to do things outside of your job descriptions and hardly ever recognized for it.
bad,"sears dont care about there workers,no raises,no matching 401k,unrealistic pa sales and time frames to repair appliances,sears is losing customers because they only care about warranty sales instead of putting customers first and caring about there employees,i never worked  at a company were there are so many unhappy technicians."
bad,"I worked for Sears Home Delivery in Sacramento, Ca. from Spring 1997 til June 2007. We took inbound calls from delivery drivers, Sales department, Warehouse personnel as well as customers."
bad,"It is your everyday typical retail position."
bad,This place was good at first and during the holidays. no benefits. You're just a body to sign people up for credit cards in a failing economy. Lack of morals too pushy
bad,"slow paced, randomly busy at times, hardest part was finding picked items that were missing or misplaced, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and making them laugh"
bad,"Overall you dont want to work for this company !!  I really dont want to talk more about this company. If you dont have anything good to say, dont say anything at all."
bad,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE!! Management practically gives all their work to 16 y/o employees so that they can sit in the break room, eat snacks, and just ""hang out"". I was never given the time off that I requested, and when I asked if someone could cover me the days that they did not give me I was given an attitude, because apparently these people don't respect that their employees have a life outside of this horrendous minimum wage job. Going to work should be enjoyable, especially for a 16 year old, like myself, who is just trying to save up enough money for a car. However, I find myself dreading the hour I have to go to work everyday, and frankly, I would rather not have a car than to have to work in this place any longer."
bad,"My first two years of being employed with this company were great. However, the last two have been horrible to say the least. Poor management, no money, policies never followed, and dispicable customer service. Now I would recommend this as a first job, but that's it. The company is dying real fast, and they're doing absolutely nothing to save it."
bad,Being a Salesman in a place with no customers while being judged on your metrics is an absolute nightmare.  Add the fact that half the sales departments don't guarantee minimum wage and if you don't sell enough in commissions then they loan you money to make minimum wage and take it out of your next paycheck.
bad,"Been working at sears for almost 2 months and absolutely hate it. For your first retail job i don`t really recommended due to the fact that they require that you sell 3-5 credit cards per day and if you don't they can eventually write you up and terminate you. I sold 18 cards my first month and that wasn't enough for them so they gave me a write up just because i didn't meet their credit requirements. If you're not good at sales, then this is not the job for you."
bad,I met some really good people there. Some managers were terrible. Some were great. I love tools so working in the tool department was fun. I liked helping people get what they need for their projects.
bad,"Management will become the problem for you and can not help when needed n number of time."
bad,they wont give you good hours and the pay is very poor also if you work on commission its very hard to make decent money because they are going out of business.
bad,"good place to work, co-workers are great always ready to help, but management is the worst.  the most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to work with different systems and every day you learn something different"
bad,"Getting all my work done"
bad,They are an outdated union shop that works their employees into the ground. They had me working in unsafe and uncomfortable situations.
bad,Was not great at all. The store I worked for ended up closing its doors. Nobody got raises or the hours they needed. There was no want to be there for anybody.
bad,"When I got hired at this place, I was going to work at Electronics with base pay plus commission, I was lied to. I work in Home Appliances on strict commission. If you have the Salesman mindset this will be perfect for you, otherwise I highly reccommend staying away. Its a constant stressful roller coaster where you work even on your days off having to constantly worry about your sales and hoping nobody returns anything so you don't lose money. You work 35- 40 hours per week 9 hours a day basically doing nothing but hoping you make a decent sale. This job will only pay your bills if you sacrifice your personal life to it."
bad,Company leadership continued to change. Old buildings and old equipment with no money to improve. People stayed for many years.
bad,"cluster with co workers stuggling to make sales earning 100% commission, while continuing to support a sinking ship."
bad,The management over used their power. They acted like they could not understand that we have real life problems and they write you up for everything. I told my manager I was going out of town for a trip I had planned over a year in advance and I reminded him every chance I got. He totally forgot and wrote me up for a no call no show. Just ridiculous. They over worked us for minimum wage. The breaks were short.
bad,The job is okay if you just want to work somewhere around school and flexible hours. The job can have some very ignorant managers who are just plain rude and don't care about your situations.
bad,"I began working after Christmas as a selling associate. We work off of commission. My experience however has forced me into a position of constant stress. No one else can seem to answer a customer's answer, no matter how simple it is. I feel like a father at this point with so little of the management team actually focusing on what's important: The customer's experience. I feel as if other's don't care as much as I do."
bad,Great place to gain experience in the supply chain industry. Company is not profitable and is selling off profitable assets. Very poor future outlook. Very high turnover and lack of clear direction from management.
bad,"I enjoyed the actual accounting part of the job. My co-workers were also a nice group of people. My job consisted of counting large amounts of money, balancing the safe, and accounting for disbursements and various transactions in a software program."
bad,"Great people to work with, But work life balance is out the window, Really well compensated. Alot of Politics and stress with the organization."
bad,"I enjoy working for my manager, but the immediate supervisors are rude and lowers my moral. The supervisors are unprofessional, and appear not to know  how to schedule there staff in a timely fashion. I feel the  immediate supervisors need time management & customer service coaching training. However, I am a professional so, I continue to do my job as instructed."
bad,It wasnt the worst place to work but it seems as if all sites are closing and many employees were demoralized and not encouraged
bad,"Meeting new clients on a daily basis was a given, however, the experience was never mundane. There was always something new to do with every single subject I photographed. In essence I believe I learned from most of them something positive that I would later incorporate in my growing photography skills.  "
bad,The members were great to work with for the most part. Hard to help everyone with all the guidelines. Fun environment and good people
bad,"Typical day at work consists of writing up vehicles for services and repairs, ordering parts, answering phones, cashing out customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with customers, advising them on services their vehicles need, coming up with a solution that benefits them, as well as the company. Hardest part of the job is being severely under staffed, not able to assist every customer, often times leading to upset customers who no longer wish to bring their vehicles to our shop."
bad,This company is not a bad company. but this management is difficult and hard to work with. I was there for years and was never given a raise they always stated that it was coming but then told that there was never in the budget for it. for the pay it was not worth it
bad,"Worked in tools and lawn and garden departments, mixed paint, sold air tools, learned a lot about lawn tools and equipment, enjoyed talking to customers, friendly coworkers, competitive sales, offered credit card applications, handled product displayed and signage."
bad,Either very busy or very slow.  Flexible hours and nice location.  Nice coworkers and okay management.  Not the best place for growth.
bad,"Do not work for Wal-Mart unless you are a high school student or a person who is being supported by someone else. It is common knowledge that this company is not a great place to work. Jobs like this and fast food are really good for your first job but you cant expect to support anyone other than yourself off of the wages that they want to pay. Their is a reason that while shopping here that you notice that the employees and management have bad customer service, they are stressed out because they are working a job that doesn't pay well enough to support them, its understandable that maybe they don't have a choice in which job they can work at the time. Also Wal-Mart is terrible for the economy."
bad,"Even though the company has been around for a long time, its not what it used to be. Sales are down, customer loyalty isn't there anymore. Yes it is a job, but not a career anymore."
bad,"Sears was not a good experience for me. The company did not offer very good benefits for their employees, and they would constantly change pay systems across the departments. During the two years I was with the company they changed the pay system in one department three times, each in an attempt to pay the employees less. The health benefits were not good, at the time there was not tuition assistance, and so on. Not a good company to work for."
bad,"The job was okay. Clean up duty was not easy, shoes were spread everywhere. Managers varied every day so had good days and bad days."
bad,"I (basically) started out at Sears & Roebuck in their flagship store in Hicksville, NY.  This was at a time when personal computers were beginning to hit  the open market.  This made it a very exciting time to be part of this burgeoning industry and Sears grabbed onto this opportunity to be a big part of what would, one day, as we now see, become such a large and influential part of every-day life."
bad,"Management rarely comes out on the floor. Basically there is no communication and the chain of command is broken. Procedures are not followed. Certain employees are not held accountable for anything. Overall at this location, it is not a good place to work."
bad,"Although the people I worked with were generally enjoyable people, the company itself has been flailing for years and is still circling the drain. If you want a good intro into call center management this is a good place to start, but don't plan on it being around for more than 5 years."
bad,But on appliance go on delivery talk to the customer work the my co workers . the hardest part lifting the appliance driving to the customer  calling the customer set up the delivery
bad,"Promoted within two years, supportive management, great coworkers."
bad,worked there for 13 years.... 5 years to long!!!! It was a great company when I started but declined tremendously the last 5 years. The company created a very stressful and almost hostile like working environment towards their employees. The employee turnover ratio numbers were staggering. SAD!!!
bad,"A typical day at sears was very busy but I made the job better by me being the person I am and the personality I carry. By working at sears I learned to have more patience and the task at hand that needed to be done. Management wasn't the best but I made the job a happy working environment, because it wasn't about me it was about the customers. I actually enjoyed going to work because my co-workers had my best interest at heart. I wouldn't mind working with them again. The hardest part of the job was around the holidays cause the store had coupons and there was only certain items on sale that accepted those coupons. Overall the job was a great experience wouldn't mind working for the company again."
bad,"The actual managers are very nice here. But the stress caused by the numbers is not worth it. Sears expects everyone to meet their exact metrics, and if you don't you constantly get a talking to."
bad,I worked for this company for 6 weeks . The first day I started I noticed there are a lot of lights that are not working I was told this is normal. I was not ever trained in this position just told that I was a manager that was supposed to help the sales associates sell damaged or out of date items . I was also told that I had to put up all of the weekly ads and cleaned the apparel isles every day . There was online training but was not given access to it. I asked both managers to give me 2 set days off a week so I can work my second job  they at first agreed but after Black Friday refused telling me that this was not a option and that I had to work my scheduled shift. They coach employees which I don't agree with and allow bad employees to continue to work after multiple write-ups. You will need to be in excellent shape since the store is huge and lots of walking expected .
bad,Fast paced work environment.  Opportunity to take ownership for results.
bad,Management is overworked and not paid well enough. Store is full of bad attitudes. Vacation time is limited and holiday work is required.
bad,"it is closing stores daily what more can I say? everyone is loosing thier jobs with this company, all top executives are even jumping ship."
bad,"I honestly liked me job allot. The people are great and thats what made it worth it. Problem is the job itself. Minimum pay for maximum work. Hours are garbage since Obamacare ""their excuse anyways"" and many people work there for years and still only get minimum wage. This is a great place for anybody in between jobs, retired or in school. DO NOT plan on this as a career or you will be very disappointed. As for the work, it was not bad. Not as easy as one might think though. Fast paced and lots of heavy lifting."
bad,"When I first started working at Sears almost two years ago we had more business than we could handle. As the years progressed more and more changes were slowly implemented, such as our shop hours getting cut back. As of recent, corporate Sears has decided to eliminate all of its part time employees (such as myself since I am a college student) to cater to it's full time needs. The employees there are absolutely wonderful hard working people, but with these new changes those people that have put blood sweat and tears into this business (literally) are being driven out and are seen as an inconvenience for payroll. I find this to be absolutely ridiculous. They will not be able to operate efficiently with the staffing model they are planning on implementing, by only having one person working the front seven days a week. It will become too overwhelming. Their sales will plummet as major mechanical work will no longer be accepted. They will revert back to oil changes and tires, and honestly, that's not going to pay off that four hundred MILLION dollar loan they took out to keep themselves afloat. I will be generous with my guess here but I would say Sears has a year left of business before they collapse, if that."
bad,"•Accurately and efficiently tendered sales transactions per store policies and procedures"
bad,"I was a CSA. You are required to be off the sales floor 30% of the time. I was to do scheduling for the sales floor, inventory, planograms, stocking, and act as stand-in manager when the store manager was not there  (which was more often than not). His whole philosophy was ""There should be no reason why any reason should ever get to me"". My 70% of time on the sales floor was for the most part enjoyable. It was commission based so you definitely had to have the salesman mentality."
bad,"There are fun people to work with. However, Management was short staffed and has no idea what they are doing. The rest of the departments are short staffed. Policies are completely contradictory to itself. When hired they tell you the pay is phenominal and that there is a possibility of high income. What they don't tell you is your pay is $6.00/hr and your commission rate is only 1%-4%. It is also not disclosed that by abiding by Sears policy it cuts your commission. So if someone is looking for a part time job to put some experience on their resume Sears isnt a bad job. If you are looking to support yourself Sears is not the place to be."
bad,"Not sure if this company will be around in 10 years. when all the managers start leaving at once and none of them can tell you if you will still have a job by the end of the year, because they were forced to sign confidentiallity forms."
bad,"This job was all based on credit apps, the goals are outrageous and you are treated like a lower employee based on your applications numbers, the higher the number the better your job is. "
bad,Great folks to work with....we're all under pressure to get the work done.
bad,"busy, all day long as stock was delivered responsible for unpacking and tagging shoes, as well as stocking and restocking shelves. got along well with co-workers and managers my job was not hard at all. the most enjoyable part of my job was making my customers satisfied."
bad,"this is a fast paced work environment, from the time you come in the door, its non-stop with processes, customer assisting and maintaining the sales floor, the management team works well and cohesively.  The hardest part of the job is adapting to the new general managers, they change so much when they come in and it keeps you feeling a lack of consistency in your schedule and not knowing when more tasks will be added to your already overflowing work load.  I enjoy most the fellow management team that I work with, a good group of people who communicate and work well together."
bad,"-we two of working shifts in receiving area at sears.. one during the Early morning, we have truck container coming in to received and take out all the stuffs inside, sorted and put on the skid everything Dept. 18 where they are and put on there stockrooms,, other are Afternoons which we helped the customers in Picking their stuffs, and do the deliveries which the truck company to be pick it"
bad,"I enjoy working, trying to be the best i can be every day, learned a lots of new techniques and new challenges in regards to the new job in question got rewarded few times for selling the most merchandise and customers calling back stating what a great experience they had with my customer service skills."
bad,"My day always started off by going over the deliveries and calling customers. Then I would load the delivery truck and check with the manager for the day plan and things that needed to be completed. Then my helper and I would go get breakfast and hit the road for deliveries. After all deliveries were done and completed we would head back to the store to help with sales, organizing the back room and sales floor. "
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of having to get member feedback, credit, protection agreements, base to bonus, and leads. I learned that this is very demanding for a part-time job. Management does what they are suppose to do, which is what their bosses tell them to do. My co-workers are wonderful, had some drama between women and boys, but what work place doesn't have that? Hardest part of the job would be the constant hours upon hours of training. Most enjoyable part of the job was the praise you get from your managers if you do what they ask."
bad,Sears was a hard place to work they excpect too much from their employees. The pay is too low and the managers were rude. Hardest part was doing too many jobs at once the enjoyable part was working with friends.
bad,Poor supervisory that treats adults like they're children. Unorganized non-structured company.
bad,"Honestly, The Outlet Store was a very bad place to work!!  Pay was horrible, you didn't get paid what you should have and management was HORRIBLE!!!! Supervisors would take your sales from you and to be honest one of the worst places to work!!!!"
bad,"This job was a challenging job which I have never worked in a call center environment before. Trying to persuade customer to believe in a protection plan for their appliance was very difficult to get them to buy. Although, I had a short script to read and also I had to adlib to persuade them that they needed the protection plan. My sales weren't too good and therefore I didn't meet the goal quota for the 90 days probation. I was laid off. It was a great experience but a challenged one too. I appreciate having the opportunity to learn something new. At this time SALES wouldn't be my first choice to pursue for a career. I meet some great people at this job who I was very fascinated by. Although my enthusiasm was there but my sales stink. I was very good in customer service then selling."
bad,"I would do the bank deposit, review job applicants, set up interviews, do a job interview or two.  If hired I would do the necessary paper work. Help the customers and help cashier. Do any necessary paper work. Set up sales signs, and review and up coming event promotion."
bad,"Cleaning is a typical day at work, or doing signs. I have learned so much about jewelry about the gold, gemstones, sterling silver, etc... The managers were okay, they didn't know how to communicate with the associates, unorganized, and always complained about the littlest things. My coworkers were amazing we always communicated and kept each other updated on the sales and what signs needed to be changed. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my coworkers and always being in a positive environment with my fine jewelry department, and being able to communicate with the customers and help people and just to see them smile made my day because I helped them find what they came in for."
bad,I enjoyed helping guests who came into the restaurant. I welcomed and seated guests. I liked the idea that I could move up overtime and also get a pay raise throughout time. The management however did not care about the employees. All they cared about was sales and would often times try to work their employers to death. I liked the other employes I was able to meet and the free drinks we got on duty.
bad,"Sears was fun to work at, my co-workers were fun to work with... however, it was hard to work there.  It is more so a job for high schoolers, perhaps college students.  If you have a family do not count on Sears to be understanding of that! Also, management was nice, but it was hard to be able to set up a time to talk about issues or training or questions I had...  In addition, they kept changing my schedule and telling me that I would work for these hours, but was scheduled other hours.  I also had to cover a lot of shifts because people would not show up and unfortunately Sears never fired them and found someone with more work ethics! It was annoying!"
bad,Unload truck containing store merchandise. retrieve and carried out customer merchandise and assist the customers in loading it into their vehicle.
bad,"Sears has the worst compensation company of any company I ever worked for.  They do not contribute a dime to the cost of the health care coverage they offer hourly employees, making it unaffordable.  The opportunities for an hourly employee to advance into management positions are almost nonexistent.  Though I came to work for them with more than 20 years of senior management experience, I was not eligible for an assistant store manager position because I didn't have 3-5 years of retail experience, although I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration and Management."
bad,"It is a pretty good place to work, but over the years changes were made."
bad,"Was a fun place to work,  good co workers. Was not scheduled very much."
bad,Learn content related systems and train internal and external users on these systems.
bad,"When I was hired at Sears it was my first job and I was thrilled because I had a passion for photography. I quickly realized that there was little creative photography involved. The camera was perched on a tripod that was never moved and you pressed a button on the end of a chord to take the photograph."
bad,"Empresa con estabilidad laboral con sueldo considerables, sin embargo no hay oportunidad de crecimiento, laboral, personal y profesional."
bad,"I did follow up calls with customers to make sure their purchase went well and delivery and product satisfaction was to their liking."
bad,When hired they tell you $16 an hour but when you come in for training your then told its telemarketing and if you get a bonus its like making $16 an hour. They make it seem as if the customers new you would be calling and like they really want the estimate but half the time they don't! Its a good second job but hard when its your primary income.
bad,"good working environment, friendly coworkers, just not decent pay to continue without searching for a better job."
bad,"Working consultative sales for mind numbing hour, 2-3 hours a day for 5 days. Impossible to maintain customer relations working so few hours. Commission rates are horrible, for example, if you sell a high end washers and dryer you make around 4-6%, but if you price sears.com (the same company) your commission rate drops to 2.7%. The company is large and extremely lethargic about competing with other companies, they still charge for delivery, they don't give a military discount (I live in a military town), and won't bring in high end appliances. "
bad,In my position @ Sears I work in the footwear dept.  I help customers with their footwear selection weather it is for a dress shoe for ladies or a work boot for men or children shoes.  I also work the cash register & work with setting up customers with credit cards!
bad,"The accounting work at Sears was relatively easy, albeit monotonous.  Most of my coworkers had been in their positions for ten to twenty years.  They did the same processes and steps over and over every day with no thought to process improvement."
bad,"The store that i was employed at was not a pleasant work experience  for me. Upward mobility was almost non existent, gossip was more important to coworkers rather than the customers needs. Mangers were not very helpful and constantly reminded other what they should not be doing while doing the same thing. Hardest part of the job for me was having to cope with incompetent management. The most enjoyable part was providing excellent customer service and being appreciated by the customer."
bad,Early hours. Sales departments only on commission. Management not on the same page.
bad,good job turned bad by poor management and economic downturn.
bad,"great job for high school students. the hours are fri and sat open to close, the associates are great to work with "
bad,Working at sears was ok. The hardest part of the job was keeping the shop your way penetration up as well as getting enough credit apps so you won't bring the team down. If you did not earn enough credit applications they will fire you!!! The management was horrible they had a low quality of communication with the associates. I didnt really enjoy anything but helping the customers with thier purchases
bad,Once a week on Wednesday I had newspapers delivered to me. My responsibility was to have them all delivered accordingly by Friday of the same week.
bad,"I learned a great deal from this job; good and bad.  The constant inventory issues have repeatedly destroyed consumer confidence in the company. Too many logistics problems that are out of your own control contribute to a dock in your pay."
bad,"management left much to be desired.  there are many nice people working here, but over all i feel under paid for the amount that i do for the store, and communication between departments is severely lacking."
bad,"daily cashiering and fixing racks. boring job, dead spots throughout the day."
bad,"When I started this company thing were fantastic."
bad,To be fair I was a part time with the company. The money for only 3 days I worked was pretty good. The management was friendly and helpful with the complaints. Very flexible with your school schedule.
bad,"This company cares very little about its employees, The only thing they give a rats behind about is $$$$$$$. And to be honest, they are becoming very poor at making it. Management was useless, HR was useless, and that's all i got to say"
bad,Fun workplace alot of great people work for company just you can be fired just for going to the bathroom
bad,Too much unhealthy competition.Not enough individual recognition.
bad,"sales, cleaning ,"
bad,"Practically anyone can get hired here, just make sure you have sales knowledge. Performance metrics are fairly easy to meet, however some days are better than others. Customers will let you know what they want at the beginning of a call, most customers are of an older clientele, know how to talk to them. There is commission, but having low performance numbers will make you lose your money."
bad,management is too worried about saving money that they do not care about trying to increase profits. They are stuck in the past and only care about the chairmans net worth.
bad,Company is always changing their minds on what to do. No consistency. No support from regional managers. Everyone for themselves.
bad,"Sales, planograms, running registers and merchandising."
bad,Folded clothes and cleaned fitting rooms. Helped customers find items. Assisted with cashiering.
bad,"working at sears is fun yet under pay, its a part time job noone should except this as a full time position and when a person move on to better themselves a bad report should not be put on them well learned experience"
bad,"Due to the recent closures of the business it has become very empty, the morale is very low and the hours continue to get cut at particular locations"
bad,"no raises for employees for the last four years, the a.c. does not work during the summer or heat in the winter . the employee turnover is very high due to unhappy employees and pressure to acheive the corporate goals. Those that don't quit get fired. I do currently enjoy working with some of my coworkers and my one Manager.I also enjoy the hard work"
bad,"Typical day at work was filled with various tasks to do either doing new floor plans, being on the register, selling merchandise, doing stock or inventory. The management is pretty nice along with co-workers. Hardest part of the job is keeping track of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is enteracting with everyone co-workers or customers."
bad,"I learned alot working at Sears, and gained valuable experience, however i would have liked my working experience at Sears to have been a more enjoyable."
bad,I was a brand central manager. Seemed to have an ad change daily. Too slow for my liking had to get out.
bad,"inadequate training,little or no factory training"
bad,"loaded customer vechicles,unloaded trucks and stocked warehouse and assembled grills."
bad,Very stressfull at times. Management work load can be unbearing.
bad,They dont give raises... they hound u about credit apps. An threaten to fire you if u dont get customers to sign up
bad,"- typical day average, w/little stress on sales floor"
bad,Sears Automotives was a great job to have at first. I was hired by one manger who not longer after retired. When i was hired on i was placed on the sales floor shortly after she retired i was placed in the auto shop with no expereince with cars. I was working on cars not knowing exactly what to do but the team members pointed me along the way. The difference between sales floor and back shop wasnt just hands own with the cars but also the pay switched from hourly to commission per car. I wasnt making enough money and was afraid to actually work on peoples cars because of the safety hazard.
bad,The management team needed training/coaching on how to speak with employees and how to motivate people. I understand that job is a job but I will not be yelled at nor watch others be yelled at which is why I choose to leave.
bad,This was my first job and it was a great experience. Nice enviorment and good staff
bad,"Diciplina, entrega,  compromiso y responsabilidad  y paciencia"
bad,"The main thing I remember from my time at Sears is that everyone was a little on edge due to not knowing the status of the company. As of right now, Sears has a date for going out of business. During my time, that date was not known, causing problems for a number of employees that depended on the extra money that came from working there."
bad,Lay back let you do your job can ask other for help when needed large selection to technical data and manfactor website for techincal infomation  plus knowleage manager
bad,"I definitely learned a lot working for the company but always felt that there wasn't a clear path forward for the future of the company. While my immediate supervisors were great to work with the top management needs to provide clear direction on how the company, including stores and online, are going to become profitable given the lack of investment in these areas."
bad,company is out of business. shifts were consistent with the lifestyle. I have to work nearly every weekend. Very stressful sales-oriented place without any value
bad,I worked as a cashier and it’s literally just that. Expect to be standing at the register for 4-8 hours. Worst thing about this job is trying to get credit card applications. Management is SO pushy and they make the environment of work hostile. You do get commission for each application tho. $2 for each application (approved or not). It’s not a hard job but the added stress of pushing for credit cards was too much.
bad,"Management is structured by a shouting match through the corporate ladder, stores are horribly out of date and neglected and the company pushes metrics very hard considering very low pay."
bad,"This may have been attributed to the specific location where I was employed, but the management and sales expectations were terrible and unrealistic (respectively)."
bad,En lo personal me gustaría que el horario de laborar fuera mas flexible
bad,I disagreed with the way management handled certain situations especially when it came to whether the associate was getting the amount of credit applications. They basically cut your hours till you quit and stuck you in departments you were not comfortable with. While even with my disagreements with management I enjoyed working with my coworkers who were always willing to help when needed.
bad,No podría dar buena referencia de Sears ya que el ambiente no es agradable
bad,"Sears is a warehouse job so you work hard. I like working hard walking appliances around the warehouse. The thing that doesn't sit well with me is the two week paycheck. You survive of the pay check, way under paid!"
bad,"Was first job for a high school student. Easy work however they required you to sell their store card no matter what and not take no for an answer, also had short staff for restock so you would always get dragged away for the registers to restock without any knowledge of what you were doing and then if your drawer was short cause you were away you'd get written up"
bad,-Great company to work for but sadly it is now being ran into the ground due to terrible management practices. Not enough staff to carry out all duties around the store. Lay offs and job removals taking place. New hires will have to pick up slack for lack of workers . Not a great place to be for sales men and women anymore. Other than that the job training and course materials provided for daily learning are great.
bad,"The job is decent if you want just part time. Saw the writing on the wall coming with the store closing."
bad,"There is nothing else to say.  When the store closes, there is no additional ad on's or magic words that will help. I learned that nothing is forever."
bad,"It should be a great place to work. However, it is bankrupt and there is no job security at all. The company invests in new technology and great place to work. However, benefits are poor and no job security."
bad,It was alright  for my first job. They did train  me but the hours could have been  better  than what they were. The work load was rather  easy and in the same time boaring.
bad,"Certainly will provide an opportunity to quickly learn requirements of today's business world."
bad,"Although sears is not what it used to be , the company runs a very flexible schedule , part-timer's can work almost full-time hours (27-38 hours) with a  very task oriented work environment . A great example would be that their is no need to be a tool selling genius or no need to be a physical trainer to sell gym equipment ; the company and employees do a pretty good job of preparing everyone. Now what I will say is that the company has done so little in investing in its self and its employees that downfall is imminent , like when was the last time you or anyone saw a sears commercial ? a pretty long time or when was the last time they put money into updating their system . The registers look like the same ones from back in the 80's with and early 2000's touch screen that freezes upon tapping it to hard, I can honestly say I enjoyed some of my time at sears but as a commission based associate everyone knows that the less foot-traffic in your stores the less money in that check at the end of the week."
bad,"Provide courteous and proactive support to Customer by accurately and efficiently completing sales at the center aisle or exit cash-wraps."
bad,"The company is struggling, they through to much at you without enough training, a lot of the employees are lazy and not much is done about it, and the managers really push the employees to push credit card offers."
bad,"Store was always slow paced, managers were very pushy about getting customers to apply for Sears Credit Card. Hours were never consistent, so you'll definitely need a second job."
bad,"I worked at Sears during the winter holidays which I actually quit before Christmas because I couldn't stand it. During the holidays it would get very quick paced (obviously), but I couldn't stand the type of customers I was getting and management did a poor job on being available if I needed help. This caused me to ask others around me for help while they were trying to sort out their own issues. The first day I arrived, I got a very fast explanation on the cash register and was thrown into it immediately without any experience. They also put massive pressure on getting emails from customers, and if you reach below the 80% mark, they would call in and make sure you do better. Some customers simply just didn't want to give emails no matter what."
bad,"No comment , It was a job and towards the end I left because I didn’t feel appreciated . It started out great and I was even leading salesman for 3 months but then turned into me doing day to day things that were not in my job description . I stayed late came in early and wasn’t getting noticed at all . Anyway enough of talking about this . I would be happy to talk about my position with Scottsdale stadium working with sports and people I liked and loved the job ."
bad,"I was doing delivery and installation of appliances which was very hard and difficult, especially in the winter. The reward was inadequate and there was no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"I worked at Sears Home Improvement products for several years, since the job was base plus commission  it was feast or famine,  when the economy crashed in 2006 our business eventually dried up. The store I worked for eventually closed its doors, even after the economy recovered there were issued at corporate level that made things difficult for store managers and crew."
bad,I really do not know if Sears has a future. I came into the business wit little experience and accepted an entry level position. At the time Sears had clear paths to the next level but over time with store closures ripping anchor stores from malls came less business and the opportunities went with it.
bad,"My duties as a customer service representative in catalogue were to make sure all parsles and deliveries that were ordered through catalogue were on time, and given to the right people. Along with making any orders and writing the correct addresses names..ect."
bad,"Assisting customers with picking items, change room cleaning, rearranging displays, and bringing in new items. Enjoyed bringing in new items and rearranging the displays when it was needed. Hardest part of the job was assisting upset clients."
bad,"Managers didn't often stand up to customers, and often customers would take advantage of the return policy. The crowd in the store was never consistent, and would occasionally be dead or would randomly be packed."
bad,Everything was good until we were all called into the office to sign papers saying we were informed that we were all getting laid off. this was a month and a half before the store was gong to close but they had known for 6 months we were going to close.
bad,"the pay was minimum wage and the work load was overwhelming. Every day and every shift was understaffed, so everyone was upset when they had to take on more work then they could complete."
bad,"Most of the stress felt was because of the hectic nature of the work. Also, I didn't have any real training, so every element was new and had to be learned on the job. It left me never knowing what to expect. This plus the physical excursion left me tired and anxious."
bad,"Sears was a great place to work for many years, however due to it's recent economic issues, I wouldn't recommend working here.  They are unstable and continue to do mass layoffs."
bad,very high turnover witch transferred to high call volume and mandatory over time. very high stress level due to needing to sell a minimum of home warranties.
bad,"No reviews, no raises nothing really. Only good thing is the management, along with a flexible schedule if you want to take some unpaid time off at least a couple weeks in advance. "
bad,"Coworkers and customers were wonderful. Unfortunately the company underpaid employees while overworking them by cutting vital positions expecting overworked management to cover the loss."
bad,I worked in the warehouse had a good team and it was fun. At the end of the day I couldnt sustain a living working at sears. Minimum wage and no benefits.
bad,"Very hard to offer what the company wants when you are always cutting hours and positions.  You want the members first, but there are no associates to help the members."
bad,Filled with very old people who dont share information and at times give inaccurate information. Low morale and everyone is constantly waiting to be laid off
bad,"This job was okay. I just needed a full time position with benefits and they wouldn't give me the hours. Plus, they paid less than minimum wage and wanted you to push certain things on customers to get special bonuses."
bad,"very lay back, majority of the time you will be finding what to do because you are bored most of the time, the managers are good but some are rude. they would give you the hours if you need them"
bad,"Once Kmart bought out Sears. Sears no longer cared about"
bad,"Phone call with district manager daily to discuss travel plans to locations and visiting marketers. Learned how to be strong in a very cut throat environment. Culture was very disconnected so far as management above myself. Hardest part of the job was conference calls with corporate that were negative on entire region. Most enjoyable, traveling to visit and train my marketers."
bad,The work was challenging and rewarding and the team is professional and pleasant to work with.  However the role in recent years had not been valued and being off-shored.  Role eventually got eliminated.
bad,Not terrible for a first job but not a place to go for a career. Pay wasn't very great and hours varied. Very slow and hard to keep yourself occupied.
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers most. Low pay, no raises, commission structure is terrible."
bad,"Because Sears is a struggling company and striving to survive, the emphasis is not on careers, but jobs. There are frequent personnel changes that reduce Fulltimers and Managers alike."
bad,"Sears was not a bad place to work by any means, however, they decided to randomly terminate me because I could not be full time, and they thought that they were closing so they ""didn't need excess employees"". This was in 2014 and as of 2/6/18 they are still open."
bad,rien a ajouter car aujourd'hui sears a fermé !!!!!!
bad,Sad to see the Historic Company Sears Roebuck constantly struggle and close so many stores. Future looks questionable at best. Focusing on the task work and not the customers never pays.
bad,"Fast paced under paid no raises.  Poor benefits and no room for advancement. Bad work life balance,start out with service calls if you run behind will not take calls off. But if your just starting out might be a good fit for you."
bad,"AS we all have heard through the news Sears was destined for failure by the corporate business world."
bad,As you would expect from a dying company they pay as little as possible to keep their stores and associates going. If you apply here expect to paid around minimum wage.
bad,"Lots of pressure to sell add ons, credit applications and extended warranties.  Physical requirements, 100% commission made for a very competitive cut-throat environment."
bad,"They want you to bust your butt, for little money. After you work your shift, they will tell you that we had to stay longer. It was hard to get a vacation day"
bad,"I worked in the back room as a merchandise pick up associate. The only good part about the job was the work out it gave you. The team was good as well. However, minimal wage is not an acceptable wage for the work load given at sears. The fact that the mpu associates literally risk their lives everyday they go into work isn't worth minimal wage. We had to lift things that are almost impossible to lift. Even with 2 people at times it's impossible to lift. Supervision to begin with was corrupt and didn't have the employees best interest at heart. Management would rarely communicate with us and if they did it was bc they wanted something done. If the sales associates didn't do their jobs properly it would mess us up and then we would be the ones to get in trouble for things. Hours where only good during the holidays and that was about it. I literally lost interest in the job and just stopped going in all together. Management was alright. It switched hands a few times and that in itself is troubling. The company doesn't give raises and is literally decaying due to choices made on the corporate level."
bad,The Sears I worked for was very stressful and had poor management. You couldn't get the days off you wanted and they would stress over time off request even for emergencies. I've done to much for that store that's way below my pay grade.
bad,I watched a company go from thriving to barely surviving in a 10-12 year period. There were constant cuts in hours and number of associates in each department. Everyone seemed to have to constantly work harder and harder without any possibility of a raise. Awesome people but such oppressive atmosphere.
bad,I did not like the work environment and was mislead on how much I would be able to make during the time there. While working there the point of sale system was extremely old and hard to navigate and long hours of standing around with very little costumers.
bad,"I learned a lot of basic retail skills, and I also was able to easily balance work and school. So the job is ideal as a starter or temporary job, But not really anything else outside of that."
bad,"Sears Holdings is going through many changes all the time and the instability of my job is what made me leave the company. Unfortunately, the corporate employees are so amazing and hard workers but it doesn't show in the stores. I wish the CEO was more present in the office. He never comes to the corporate office."
bad,Sears is not doing so well which is causing a lack of customers. Employess in applicainces get paid on what they sell so if there are no customers then you cant make money.
bad,"As a sales consultant work was slow and some times non-productive, I was mostly assigned as a trainer and walked the floor most of the time. The slow sales and the lack of hours were stressful. The best time was during the end of the year when there was a holiday sale and multiple discounts."
bad,"Not a nurturing environment, employee camaraderie not encouraged there for a lack of teamwork existed there.  A lot of managers were promoted from withing without having management training or experience.  Generally a disjointed environment with very poor communication across the board."
bad,"The service manager tried to make things better for the techs, management would not let him change needed things for improvement for the techs or our division which eventually caused our division to shut down."
bad,Sears seems to be declining and losing their customer base.  Upper management not providing any clear direction for company or plan to turn business around.
bad,malheureusement je n'ai pas vraiment appris grand chose .
bad,"Working at Sears seems like it would be easy and it is. However along with being a cashier in an overpopulated area that's peak hours were ALL hours, it can be very stressful. Along with being a cashier your job is to push for credit card applications, which you have to have a minimum of 10 in an 8 hour shift. Sears gets extremely packed and overwhelming during holiday season when sale prices come out."
bad,i would say that by far this was the easiest optical job ever. patient comes in. you sell to them or you dont. and you are off to help the next patient. fun job. low pay.
bad,"At thus time do not wish to disclose, I plan on leaving this company as soo as I the opportunity. I will not answer any other questions in regards to this company."
bad,"I would come to work my shift for 8 hours. I learned customer service and how to communicate with people. Some manager was friendly and easy to talk to about the job, and some was not so friendly. Stressful, long, and tiring. Dealing with Some manager was hard sometimes. The people who I work with the day go by faster."
bad,"muy pesados la mayoria, sin contar que hay favoritismos y en base a esos favoritismos es como te tratan."
bad,The pay is the main complaint I have. You are paid commission so if you do not sell than you will not get paid.. If they have to pay you and you didnt sell than the company pays you minimum wage for your hours worked. But they will deduct any of the (draw pay) out of your next check. It was very hard getting used to the way they pay at Sears.
bad,The Appliance technician position I had paid well starting. However I came in when they were desperate for workers. That led to horrible training because they wanted to rush you out.
bad,Every cashier was always on their phone (besides me) and never got into trouble. I was considered the golden cashier and managment fought over me which is one of the main reasons why I left. It was frustrating to be the only one that wanted to do the job
bad,"I really enjoyed working with my smart, talented team."
bad,"I did not like when Sears went with kmart lot of people lost their jobs, and I was one them that got lay off. I do not shop at Sears and kmart. I would never go to the places."
bad,This job is good if you want to open the doors into Customer Service. You do need to open a lot of credit or you won't get much hours working at all. Management was a disaster and was all over the place. Schedules were always shifting and changing when you least expected it. Helping out customers was the best part and seeing some of them thank me was the highlight of my day. Every other part was either bad or decent enough to handle.
bad,Management was more concerned with metrics than customer service.  This created long lines and angry customers.  While I agreed with the customers being upset I still had to give them the Sears third degree about their personal information.
bad,"Sears was good place to work. Not for the people (now) but for the current company in  general. So all I can say is, goodbye old friend,thank you for the wonderful time you provide us."
bad,"Everyone knows the story of Sears. "
bad,"Honestly, sears care about their customer so you have tp be people friendly, management is nice if you are nice to them. You will have to meet a quote at the end of the week so you have to stay on top of your work."
bad,"Worked for Sears Commercial, a little known division of Sears that serviced and sold products, strictly to Home/ Apartment Builders and Renovators.  I enjoyed coming to work each day. I was able to accomplish much here. Disliked the abruptness and unnecessary lay off of most in the division nationwide, including myself, when my territory was performing above goal."
bad,"It was a great first job , but i wasnt given proper training, they had me start working immediately and got upset that i could do what was expected of. I was let go from Sears do to being ""seasonal"" but I wasnt hired to be seasonal , my belief is they were looking for an excuse to let me go."
bad,"Upper level management seemed more concerned with ""control"" rather than customers, associates, and sales. Unnecessary stress trickled dow to Associate level. Associates over extended because of insufficient hiring and scheduling."
bad,I began employment as a Christmas/temporary hire.  I remained on part time.  Pay is not competitive.  I would not choose this employment as a career because the pay would not support my family.
bad,The only way to make any money in this company is if you are in sales or management. And as of late sales have been going down so its hard to make money even there.
bad,"There is very little advancement opportunity, they are not flexible with schedules, insurance is expensive, pay is low. The company morale is at an all time low."
bad,"Work was consistent, but you were not paid enough. Dealt with unmotivated management, and the hours were tolerable. It was just a job to pay the bills. It was easy."
bad,I Hate it Was the worst job I ever had had a first job management was horrible. People always gettin caught stealing . No extra hours was just not good
bad,"I enjoyed some of the people I worked with and the busier days. But there was a lot of down time so you get bored easily. Also learning all the parts and models when you have no prior experience. But the customers were nice and it gave me more experience multitasking with the phones, customers, and computer"
bad,"worked showing jewelry"
bad,I have worked at Sears for 3 years and have been trying to transfer to a new position but have been getting the run around each time with hiring freezes.
bad,"Staff is friendly and welcoming, not much room to grow or expand career wise. The company is driven on selling credit cards"
bad,"Boring, dull, but it pays higher than most entry level jobs. Not very stressful but get used to change. Usually I would stay doing my job for about 3 months and then your switched to a new desk with new people and under a new lead and with a new job duty. You weren't partnered with strangers though. You usually work with the same 30-35 people but are switched around the office. People are friendly and nice. Leads always willing to work with your schedule. The job is relatively easy but at times you must deal with upset customers."
bad,"different than everywhere else"
bad,I did not like having to wait for customers to come in for you to be able to get sales. Things such as weather affect your ability to make your commission. People are sharks and will quickly steal your returning customers when you are not there.
bad,I worked here for two months and it wasn't as great as I expected. Some customers were rude about the thirty day return policy and they push you on credit.
bad,Nice environment. You get to experience work and get to grow as an independent person. I worked there for about four years and received about two raises. Do not recommend this job to any adult trying to make ends meet.
bad,"Bad Management, no one is their to tell you how to do your job. infsafincet training. equinence doesn't work, prent to work."
bad,Sears has been around for a very long time. I just needed to get a new challenge so I decided to leave and find the new challenge in my life because 8 years was a long time.
bad,You don't get benefits at this job.  You mostly get paid by selling service plans for appliances and signing up Sears Cards.  You spend a lot of time working with parts for customers too.  A mechanical background is very helpful.
bad,"a good first part time job to have, experience and knowledge available with regard to sales and retail, gain customer service skills"
bad,"I worked for this company for over 2 decades. Up until the last year and a half, it was a great place to work.  Sure, we had our struggles, however, we HAD such a great team of managers that, collectively, could overcome anything that was thrown at them. Furthermore, if their was something that was still unresolved, we had one of the best GM's in the business (BV)that we could turn to for help. He respected and appreciated us as his management team, he NEVER belittled or berated us in front of any associates or other management team members, nor did he ever have the attitude of ""it's my way or the highway"". You knew as a member of the management team what was expected of you and you did it.   This new dictator that's in there now has taken a page from Hitler and likes to try to run the operation by way of ""Fear tactics"". The turnover rate is over 90% since the arrival of this person AND it was announced, by him, at one of our general meetings, as if he was announcing something positive had happened. He does not respect or appreciate anyone there but  expects it to be given to him. When he says ""thank you"" to anyone, it's so transparent that no one believes it.  It sounds scripted and void of any feeling at all....aka FAKE! "
bad,An older company with an excellent past record that has been taken over by a greedy CEO who cares only for his bottom line.
bad,"Journée très charger, endroit ou les gens sont heureux de travail stabilité d'emploi, "
bad,Watched closed circuit TV on monitor to prevent theft on a daily basis. I was promoted to trainee of new employees. I enjoyed my coworkers daily..
bad,Throws yearly fashion shows helps the customer to be aware of the latest trends in clothes. includes he employees to be a part of the event. the company does not require much time for training new hires.
bad,"I enjoyed each individual that I worked with at the store level, but upper level management is awful.  They do not support those at the store level.  Instead, they force ideas and tactics onto those at the store level that do not work.  The company culture is very dismal."
bad,"Sears didn't offer much in terms of advancement, or even a full-time opportunity. Commission rates were extremely low and it was even harder to sell anything when you are taking commission cuts for price matching your own website."
bad,"Sears was my first job and that is really all it is good for.  I could never see how anyone would make a living off working there. I was there for over two years and not once got a raise, even after asking.  Started out at minimum wage and ended at minimum wage.  This is a good place to work if you do not have a family to take care of or lots of bills to pay."
bad,"Sears is a very metric driven company. At times it feels very out of touch with employees and customers, leaving everything to feel like a statistic with a result that came to late."
bad,Working in Sears was a fun place with a very positive work environment. The only down side to my experience is that there isn't enough hours to be given.
bad,"Acomodo, vender y recibir mercancía mandar mercancía a otra tienda o devoluciones al proveedor"
bad,"Job would be fine if it weren't for the store pushing for credit. If you didn't get credit sales your hours were cut. Which was ridiculous, most of our customers didn't have a legitimate social security or anything for me to get their credit background, and no matter how hard I tried/pushed a lot of the customers immediately shut me down when I ask if they'd like to sign up for credit. Even after I offer them a discount just for applying."
bad,"This company tries to make you happy by giving you at least four say a week, then later on there are week that ZERO"" Nothing od hours and then you get stuck and worried about the dam job. "
bad,I think its a decent place to work for someone looking to get a little experience under their belt. Would not recommend long term employment.
bad,The overall job was great and relaxed. Managers were on high stress and they brought there outside drama in too work. The job had too much drama for the co-workers keep bringing high efficiency work.
bad,"A typical day at work is ordering parts, or selling parts for customers over the phone or at the counter. Usually every Tuesday and Thursday is when a shipment comes in and we go through it and call customers to tell them that the part that they ordered is in, or we put the stock in the back."
bad,"The pace at Sears, even on busier days such as Friday and Saturday, is relatively slow, even when placed in the busier departments. There are also policies to have customers become members and sign up for credit cards, which I personally was uncomfortable implementing due to their pushy nature. There are quotas to be met which I felt were unrealistic, especially considering the volume of customers. Also, I never got a friendly working environment feel from my co-workers or managers. It felt like nobody wanted to be there ever. I definitely would not go back. I'm a minor and was also not given my breaks. I was told I was ""entitled"", but they were never a required part of my work day."
bad,"I was turned onto the job by a friend of mine to help me escape from my previous bad work situation because he had almost nothing but positive things to say about the job.  The week after I started working there however things went on the downhill slope very quickly when the ASM for the department I worked in lost his job wrongfully for reasons I can't disclose."
bad,"Preperation and training for new tasks or new equitment was sadly lacking."
bad,"Sears was a learning experience. I learned that even though management may fail at their jobs you can still achieve your goals and better the company. My coworkers were very pleasant people and I enjoyed working with them, However the hardest part of the job was working in 90 degree heat due to the air conditioning not working on the top floor. However, I really enjoyed working with the customers the most."
bad,"•Provided customer "
bad,I liked working for Sears in there south county location in the woman department. The woman department had more traffic than the other sections in the store. The wages was very low but the hours was flexible.
bad,Company never knew what it wanted to do with division. It was always changing the format and could never gain any momentum or continuity.
bad,Often find myself selling products to people who don't want to buy them making it to where I do not make any more then 10.50 hr even with the promise of more.
bad,this place is a ok place to work at and i have fun here and the people here are fun to talk to and i they also know how to have a good time
bad,it is not the best place due to the fact of workers not treating you the same but i did not let that affect me i just used it as a motivation to push my self and prove that i am better than the rest i still treat everyone with respect to show i am different and just continue with it
bad,I worked softline shoes department. The management was horrible. along with the shortage of hours.
bad,"The job is not a place where I would stay at. It is almost like going back to high school. Besides people trying to start arguments for no reason, you can't really make a living working there. In order to survive, you have to live with someone else!"
bad,"Store closed, management was engaged and tried to maintain business.  Community could no longer support store."
bad,"This is a great job for the younger crowd, and the older crowd."
bad,Great job to gain experience but would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Productive comfortable working environment, But the job is not for everyone."
bad,"Unprofessional work environment and disrespectful, unorganized management"
bad,Had fun at work and the day went by very fast. I enjoyed working with my team and I lead a great department.  The hardest thing about the job was not having enough equipment to finish the job.
bad,Management didn't very much leads did more work than anybody on the mangament team.
bad,"Customer service, minimum wage, worked off commission, laid back setting with all the tools need to advance. Management look at you as more of a number then an actual person, basically if you under performed they treated you a certain way as opposed to if you were performing well. You were treated on a month to month basis with a lot of pressure to sell Warranties..they cared a lot about warranties at sears home appliance showroom. Upper Management showed up a lot and we did a decent amount of training. They tried very hard to make this business work but location was working against us overall i appreciative my time here and the many lessons i learned"
bad,The hardest part of the job was when the customers came in for the sale and the merchandise was backstocked for months and unavailable. I love retail sales and I set goals for myself and always surpassed them as well as the stores goals. I was 100 percent commission and fine with that. Management told us we did a good job.
bad,"I am 22 worked at sears off and on for almost 3 years and the that company is headed now they don't care about there employees at all they only care about dollar signs, and other metrics."
bad,"Its an ok place if you are starting out as a technician, but the ceiling there is pretty low. If you want to do anything besides basic steering suspension and brakes you are out of luck. Far too much corporate oversight of day to day operations. You spend as much time going through corporate required steps as you do actually working on vehicles. If its busy with something other than tires and oil changes you can make good money, but that is rarely the case. When its slow, as it often is, you are basically slave labor for whatever busy work there is."
bad,"I would of stay working at sears, but I had no room for growth. I want to move up fast and take on more responsibilities and others felt that I was being unreasonable. I have a family to provide for and if I am going to do a job, I am going to do it well and I feel I should be paid well to do it. Sears was not willing to see my potential, so I have to leave."
bad,I enjoyed doing planograms and resets in the clothing department. Coworkers were a lot of fun.
bad,pagan muy poco por mucho tiempo pero es un buen ambiente de trabajo
bad,"Unloading multi-containers during summer months, low pay."
bad,"Worked there in total of five years was impossible to get to management or a full time position. they hire only seasonal and part time unless they hire outside for management. And instead of telling you that you are doing bad they just lower your hours till you want to quit. Didnt tell me till the day i was supposed to be fired that i was on sales probation for comission area and made me take cashier, then fired me two weeks later."
bad,"Job has very low pay for a typical retail store, which usually pay around $8 or more. Most days in Sears include the normal cashier duties with the occasional stocking. The management can be very inconsistent during the week. When employees are in need of a managers assistance, it could take up to 15 minutes or more to receive such help, which holds up customers and the flow of the department checkout. I would say most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. They all worked well together and there was zero conflicts among us."
bad,Cashier get paid minimum wage and have the most stressful job out of all the other employees
bad,"Management plays favorites, low pay, not much room for advancement unless you are already in a management position, little to no hours."
bad,"I feel that Sears, needs bring someone in that's not apart of the company that will help them, get back on track with employees as well as their business. The company has alot of issues that need to be resolved. They do not seam to care about the employee."
bad,"What can I say this company was at the front of the retail industry after 2003 , the company suffer  such big lost because of the economy that it has never recuperated , Today is dying company with poor worker apreaciation and less respect for what Sears meant for the regualr american, the location in RAce street allentown , closed down in 2002"
bad,"Typical day involves Stock checks, product training, plan-o-grams, pep talks and occasionally selling something."
bad,The managers at the job have do much favoritism that its ridiculous. Hours are so up and down that you can have 4 hours one week.. 10 another week.. 12 the next and 8 the last week of the month. Not the place if you need to pay bills are take care of any important expenses.
bad,"I like working for Sears but anyone advancing is very rare , there are no medical benefits , the management is poorly trained. the good thing about working at Sears is the competitiveness of the sales team , the customers in the store who are friendly and the cleanliness of the store."
bad,working for sears has its up and down the people I work with are great but the company is not so great
bad,"unknow unknow, store closed only work 3 months. pay was very low, employees were great and so were the managers. "
bad,"get returns done  for the techs arround 6) techs"
bad,"For the work I did as a Loss Prevention Agent, I thought I was worth a lot more than what the company was offering. I mean, a ten cent raise every year to protect company assets? It wasn't worth my safety."
bad,Relaxed environment
bad,A typical day at work involves a great deal of floor time to ensure the customers are being assisted by qualified sales staff. At times there are customer issues perpetrated by delivery or service that must be addressed. Some of these issues are easily handled while others are quite a challenge to find a beneficial solution for both the customer and the company.
bad,"The typical day at work was one that I never cared for. Sears as a company is unorganized and constantly changing the bonus incentives for sales. I made a base salary of $8.00 per hour. If you maintain a 3% average on service plans then you saw a percentage of the service plans that you sold. Well I maintained a 3% average the entire time I was employed for Sears, which was approximately a year and a half. I saw 2 bonus checks because in this year and a half they kept changing the rules for receiving your bonus. Management at the store I worked at was great. I use the owner and former store manager as references and are personal friends with both of them. Neither are with the company anymore either. The other employees were great and knowledgeable but would back me on everything I have written there."
bad,"Rang up customer purchases, helped customers find lingerie or purses. Learned about upselling the store credit cards when someone made a purchase. Processed returns and exchanges. Covered for co-workers while they went on break. Helped other departments nearby when I was able to."
bad,I love the support from the management team. I've learned to be very independent and built very strong communication skills with customers.
bad,Long boring days
bad,I see Sears as an okay place to work there are a great team of Employees there but some managers attend to be a tad bit rude and more demanding than normal.
bad,"unless you are in with the upper mgmt, you will stagnate in current position. Sears wants ""yes"" men/women not people with vision"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls to set appointments for customers requesting installations. I learned how to better utilize my problem solving skills and focus on the customer's needs, I became a strong team player. Management was there when I needed assistance and help me set goals to accomplish to reach my sales goal. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful throughout my entire time. I would say the hardest part of the job would have been on months where the call volume was low, trying to reach our set sales goals as a team seeing that we would receive a lot of customer service calls that were misdirected. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the customers and making them feel comfortable at the end of the call knowing they would be a returning customer, they were always so appreciative."
bad,"Sears is actually not too bad of a place to work. Fo the job I was doing I was actually paid rather well considering it was in retail. However in the last couple years the company has gone way down hill. As a result, the morale of employees is low. Management is not very good at all either. The company has not updated how it runs logistically which I think will ulitmately cause a total downfall for the company."
bad,"electronics sales. low commissions. management was hypocritical, and had hardly any leadership qualities."
bad,"the management team was okay. they seem to only care about themselves. they were very flexible when it came to my school schedule but other then that, I am finally glad that I get a chance to broaden my horizons and find new job opportunites."
bad,I was a cashier and was all about assiting customers. I was in high school whule i was working here and it was years ago so i really don't remember much.
bad,"If ideas and changes were implemented smoothly, along with a new platform on which they're presented it would ease some of the everyday stress levels... My outlook on the company is partially based on the state of being in the actual store I worked in."
bad,Fun and exciting customers
bad,Put shoe on shevles and pack deliveries. How to be patient with custormers..
bad,I enjoyed working the sales floor providing customer service to customers
bad,"Sears Holdings is an interesting place to work. There is always more to learn and see, but not much availability to moving up the tower. The direct management is wonderful, very nice and willing to work with you, the higher ups in the company are exactly the opposite of that."
bad,"Retail the way sears executed it just wasnt going to survive much longer with the online market taking over, all in all it was a joke for ajob only because they knew we were all closing, but refused to tell us and we suffered teh consequences while higher ups reaped the benefits. was sad to see people who were about to retire have their plans ruined"
bad,"Manejan pesimos horarios y nula fexibilidad, muy poco comprensibles en cuestiones de tiempos y demasiada grilla."
bad,"Muy eficiente, a mi persona "
bad,Sears did not want to pay their loyal employees anything. The employees were always unhappy and I'm sure if they were paid more it would make the working experience there better. This company has now went out of business.
bad,"Horrible customer service , lazy  workers in office. Owners dont listen or care   company loves to lose money. Need to teach . Techs how to properly clean carpets."
bad,No wage increases for over 7 years.  They do not pay a proper living wage.  They also reduced their overtime rate from time and a half to an additional $2.00/hr for over time hours.
bad,I liked working with all the employees including the managers.The store get a new store manager every couple years.Their were no benefits and no pay raises.The hours was part time.They said there are no more hours to give to current employees but they always hire new employees.I did like the type of work I did.
bad,"Poor management from the top, and not well trained District managers. Store manager was ok, but OM was lazy and  job to others. I will not work at sears again and will not recommend no one"
bad,"The only thing really worthwhile about this job are the coworkers. They're awesome. The managers seem to be generally decent as well. "
bad,"I started with them in 1959 till 1973 they were the best retailer at that time. "
bad,"Would get work order for set build I would distribute the work and build room myself, also held design the rooms needed for photo shoots. And order supplies and search for lowest price."
bad,"working was very pleasent"
bad,Poor pay and stores are closing. The things they try to push are out of date and make the work place no fun to be in. Overall the upper managerment doesn’t care
bad,Almost every one I worked with at the store level were great and I would work with them again any time and any where but Sears. After nearly 21 years people in Hoffman estates ( Sears headquarters ). Decided to reorganize the company some and in the process. They eliminated did away with my position. The full time receiving associate with out any warning I showed up for work only to be told I was loosing my job.
bad,"Its a retail store, so YES we were busy especially around Holidays.  Lack of computers and having to spend more time with a customer which is backing up the lines. BIG NO NO..... The long lines are because you MUST get people to sign up for a Sears Credit Card. If you do not have credit apps you've got your customers to do, you could end up losing your job."
bad,This was my 1st high school job so it was okay. I worked a few hours because I had school. It was stressful because you would have rude customers . I also hated working Holidays.
bad,"Sears was not an ideal place to work. They have unreachable goal criteria and difficult to deal with management. While I was employed, everyone in my department walked out, until I was the only one left. I was underappreciated and treated like a child."
bad,Mal ambiente demasiado tiempo mal Pagado malos supervisores
bad,Worked as an appliance sales rep and the commission was not bad. I worked in an upper scale area and a middle class area at two different times. The money was not there in the middle class location.
bad,"Sears is almost out of business, and one can tell surely that it is simply by walking into the store today. Slow paced work with little to no customers throughout the week, made the time pass by slowly."
bad,"This was the most difficult job I have ever had. The place was so empty it could’ve been haunted. Yet you are expected to get a minimum of 10 applications a day, while you see 5 customers in 4 hours."
bad,You can't teach an old dog new tricks and there is many reasons that Sears is closing stores and soon to go out of business and the recent Kenmore launch at amazon won't patch the hole in this Titanic.
bad,Working at sears holding you can expect to not receive a raise nor have much room for promotions. At the store I worked no one got a raise in 10 years. Management was helpful and enjoyable accept for the general manager who had several times been so aggressive that he caused a few of our team leads cry. The majority of the quality employees we had left due to the GM.
bad,"I don't recommend the place, but its work. Could be lucrative depends on you honestly. Poor management for sure. If there were more traffic in and out the store, meaning more customers, then I could of tolerated it more."
bad,"I started working at Sears back in 2012. Ever since then, I went from making $7.00 an hour to $8.60 an hour as of the date of this posting. I only had 2 pay raises in the past 6 years I've worked there. What does that tell you about how they treat their employees? I also never advanced to a supervisor position when a co-worker had recommended it to me. The only positive thing I can note is I earned some extra money from online commissions. I also earned around $20-30 extra from credit card applications. I've tried to strive the best I could for someone who makes so little money. My advice, pick a job that pays well that gives you an opportunity for advancement. Sears does not do ANY of those things!"
bad,nothig much on the shelves now just a little bit of stuff that we did get from other closing sears. registers are still out of date and the refuse to fix them.
bad,"A typical day at Sears was very unorganized, other managers would tell you you have to go home early without giving you a choice, hours and pay were decreased without warning."
bad,"Cons: Incredibly mismanaged with zero job security, total lack of communication or organization, and an air of paranoia that you may lose your job at any given moment. "
bad,"from what I remember it was an ok company.  The problem was that the new office that they opened, where I worked, was just not the right location. sadly it appears that due to poor management by Sear's CEO's not sure what will happen to those that are left in the travel department"
bad,"As one finds technical knowledge within a national call center that needs to be spread nationwide to all faucets of the company, Sears cannot see the forest through the trees. The technical aspects of troubleshooting appliances is misunderstood by upper management. Millions of dollars lost annually due to poor training of technicians in the field. Basic fundamental refrigeration technology has been lost due to ignorant trainers not teaching the basics to technicians nationwide. This causes a continuous flow of frustrated customers who experience many repeat visits from technicians who cannot figure out a cause of a very basic installation failure upon delivery. This one installation failure manifests into dozens of different symptoms, which technicians are oblivious to what is causing them. The constant ordering of replacement parts and revisits for installations will eventually bankrupt Sears. The company is too big to listen to those stationed in a national call center pointing out a mega multi-million dollar cancer within the company."
bad,"I've been here about a year and 7 months and I've yet to get a raise. I haven't been offered any advancement opportunities. They took away associate discounts. You don't get sick paid time off. You have to work here for a year before you can qualify for paid time off. Now, my location is closing down and the company only gave the associates a 3 month notice."
bad,"work at sears was very easy and laidback. it tends to get boring because time went by so slow. its occasionally busy but never last long. sears outlet is a warehouse so its very outdated and dirty. makes you want to run in the shower. besides all that, if your looking for  a job that doesn't require a lot of stress this is the place, I will say there is lots of favoritism in this work place and the management plays a big part in it."
bad,A typical day work could be paced but during my time at sears I learned a lot about the mechanics of a car. Sears always treated the customers well. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help customers financially when they were really in need. While I was there I enjoyed it when customers would follow my advice.
bad,"Long hours, good pay but only if your jobs stick. Thats installed and getting to that point is even rough. Company recoups cancelled jobs pay from your pay so you end up having to pay the company back. Bs!"
bad,"Working here was fine. The worst part of the job was the money. You didn't get paid well for the job that you do. This is common in retail, but getting paid 7.25 is horrible."
bad,la empresa trabaja mucho en chismes del personales
bad,"I work for Sears for over 15 years, and held many different positions over the years. I would only recommend working for this company to someone who is not dependent on job security because of the culture designed to make stores fail,and the upper managements lack of being in-touch with their stores to keep them up to date with the ever evolving business atmosphere. The stores are failing and closing faster than ever before but the worst part is the lack of appreciation for the hard work that most people who go above and beyond to please their customers."
bad,"Over 30 years employee"
bad,"This positon was mostly dealing with inventory, it was mostly in the warehousing taking note of each merchandise that we had. No opportunity for advancement, just another learning experience."
bad,"No advancement possible in certain jobs, customers are friendly, new store has plenty to choose from store is in a good location. Typical day at sears is helping customers choose there items and help them with there problems"
bad,It has been over 10 years since this job. Only thing I remember is appling for assestant manager 3 times and each time a lower quailified person was selected due to how they knew in managemwnt already.
bad,The new position that was created has not proven to be the great opportunity that the company has made it out to be. The emails and phone calls for the position are very few and far between.
bad,"Sears is of course in difficult financial situation and the publicity of this contributes to making this a difficult company for which to work. Frequent turnover at higher levels, store closings and intermittent problems obtaining sufficient inventory."
bad,Rather stressful with the uncertainty of sears holdings and whats in the financial reports and public postings as of 2017. People are enjoyable to work with and equipment is fairly well maintained.
bad,There was a lot of pressure to gain credit card applications and the employees with the most applications got the hours.  They hired me for 24 hours and it was around Thanksgiving and Christmas so it was busy.  After Christmas they stopped giving me hours
bad,"What exactly is keeping me at Sears is due to my managers being amazing as well as very flexible with my schedule since I am a full time student, but unfortunately company is going down hill and offer virtually no great benefits for this job. Great for a part-time though (as in for pocket-change)."
bad,The employees are the best part of this store. I had an excellent supervisor. I loved the job I had and would not have changed it for anything. I left because I wanted to go part time. Also I want a new experience in the work force.
bad,I enjoyed my time working for Sears. It is great for an entry level mechanic as myself.  They have training programs and room for advancement. The store I was at had no business and we spent most days watching TV in the break room.  If you can find one still open and does a lot of business their compensation is very competitive.
bad,"Temp work around holidays not enough hours and lack of consistency. they will disrepect you if not doing the work. "
bad,"You learn alot at Sears but the pay could be jumped up just a bit to give the employees some motivation. regional managers/big bosses are a hit or miss, either they don't bother you and they're pleased, or mess up a bit and it's like the whole store is in trouble. Just do the best you can do with your head down and you can make some good Commission."
bad,Sears has always been excellent in training employees. I first worked at Sears when I was 17 years old.  Their customer service training is great and I have benefit from it in all my jobs. I have always had great Managers and enjoyed working with my co-workers and assisting the Customers.
bad,"Typical day includes standing for long periods of time simply greeting customers, very little business throughout the week, which is stressful for commissioned associates. Willing to work around your schedule though, best part."
bad,"Management was highly helpful. Customers were friendly, great environment to work in especially if you're a high school student or for your first job."
bad,Pay great hours great health care great  upper management horrible  prices for appliances very over priced. Associates salaries very low. Bad job security
bad,"Great locations, only minutes from home.  The store manger was different, covered in tats.  Always interesting customers.  Being so close to DFW Airport, we got people from all over the world. Great to be a mall, shopping too close."
bad,"I found the repair work to be very satisfying. But, advancement was based more on sales of Protection Agreements and products than quality of work done."
bad,"This place focuses on begging to sell credit cards apps more than anything. If you don't do well than your hours are cut short and customers are not the main priority. It is sad to see that they put credit cards over their own customer, great staff but UNDERPAID and if you get a job here, make sure you love begging people to sign up for a credit card."
bad,"Daily work involves preparing and moving customer purchases from storage for pick up, maintaining proper inventory of store merchandise and keeping a cleanly and organized work environment."
bad,"I've learned a lot since i started working at sears. mostly in the customer service industry. I do my absolute best to make sure customers are happy with my service. however management expects too much of us. they ask us to do tasks that aren't related to our department, it wouldn't be so bad to complete these tasks if we got paid for it. Appliance associates work on raw commission with no base pay which is why they love to have us do this work. corporate cut so many hours in our store that its a complete dead zone in the store."
bad,"Front line and middle management associates work with great passion to ensure an outstanding customer experience.  Unfortunately, top leadership is no longer in tune with the workforce as they attempt to salvage what is left of the company.  Very sad given the fact that Sears is an American icon."
bad,"Working for Sears over the years has taught me patience. There is lots of favoritism and hardly any recognitions for employees. Cashiers are to not only work in your cac area, but are also required to help on the floor during down times, therefore your doing 2 positions. Don’t call off because your hours will get cut big time."
bad,"Una exageracion en horarios, trabajar para complacer al cliente cuando en realidad el vendedor es el primer cliente que tiene la empresa si el cliente principal no esta comodo, el cliente que compra sera atendido de manera despota como suele ocurrir"
bad,I was in the top 10% in my district in all areas that we were judged in. I re hurt my back and as a result of that I had to stop working for more that a year.
bad,My job consisted of approaching the walk-in customers to solicit them for a home remodeling quote.  Customers can be very rude.
bad,Sears was an okay company to work for if you have no other choice. I wasn't there long enough to learn what I needed to know to do my job. They were still hiring new people to work even they didn't have enough hours to give to the people already working there. After three months the home office closed the store so that was fun.
bad,"Une journée de travail au Sears est plutôt agréable lorsque ce n'est pas trop occuper.Cependant il y avais beaucoup d'erreurs de prix et les prix n'étaient pas souvent programmés dans le système et il y avait souvent un manque de personnel.J'ai appris a bien communiquer avec les personnes agés car ils faisaient parti de la majorité de la clientèle, également j'ai appris des techniques de vente et le fonctionnement des cartes de crédits sears.À part ça , l'environnement de travail est bien ,les directeurs sont souvent disponible , l'aspect le plus difficile est d'essayer de m'adapter à chacun des différents rayons du magasin ( vêtements hommes , femmes , enfants , souliers , literie, vaiselles , appareils electroménagers ...) l'aspect le plus agréable est de recevoir des bons commentaires venant de la clientèle sur mon service."
bad,In my job we loaded semi-trailers. We were asked on repeated occasions to load more then one trailer at a time. The management showed little flexibility for any work concerns brought up.
bad,"The associates are a great bunch of people to work with."
bad,Everyone was in their own little department world. Main manager was not to communicative with employees. Not friendly like they say in retail smile and say hi. He wasn't like that at all.
bad,"A typical day at work for me consists of unloading trucks, and bringing out items to load into a customers car/truck. Stock locating each department to keep to a standard that allows us to consistently deliver each order in the shortest time possible."
bad,"when I came into Sears I was just actually figuring out the ropes as a auto tech and I was new to the job but learned quick. Sear's wasn't a bad experience, it was only a stepping stone."
bad,There is no real job advancement. Management can be rude. Scheduling is never is here and there. It is a calm place to work.
bad,its a ok job management was pretty cool enjoyed it while it last its one of them jobs that can keep gas in your car. Worked in the backroom
bad,"Se aprende  mucho sobre el servicio al cliente, en general es una buena empresa, con algunas deficiencias por tener modelos de administración que no reparten la carga de trabajo de forma equitativa."
bad,Worked as a Manager for 4 years and have had three different direct supervisors. The company has no direction and looks to be going down hill fast.
bad,The job was nice enivironment enjoy working there . The coworkers were very nice and I love being around customers
bad,This is a really good job that pays very well but the lack of work from other people is horrible. Also there is a major lack of communication going on with this corporation. And one other thing that I would like to add is that the workers there are far less from honest!
bad,"On any given day, there will be a combination of sales, planograms, signing, and a lot of issues with delivery and installation complaints.  Management does there best to get the issues taken care of, but it is normally out of their control.  The hardest parts of the job, are not knowing what you will make from paycheck to paycheck, as the job is 100% commission, and having to do a lot of planograms, signing, etc. for no pay.  It isn't all bad, however.  When there are a lot of sales to be made, the pay makes the job worth it, even with the above issues."
bad,"To often people are running in circles and unsure why they are doing what they are told to do.  Lack of communication - praised for one thing once week and reprimanded the following week."
bad,load up drop off appliances. was promoted to installer then sears bought out the family owned company and ruined everything.
bad,"Typical day at work would be come in and have to do multiple jobs because other people in the facility didn't want to do them. Would more often than not do more jobs than people that were there all day in my 5 hour shift. "
bad,"Worked for 2 years, under paid, over worked, under appreciated. Co workers good to work with."
bad,There were many things that I didn't agree with but this is my opinion. I would still tell anyone to go for it.
bad,"I work well in team oriented environments and look forward to expanding my career opportunities. I learn & adapt quickly in changing environments, and am not narrow in scope in my current search for a new career path. I have many skills that are very versatile in many markets and like to balance creativity & business."
bad,"Clock in, sign out a pricing device, load stock and product on floor and stockroom, assist customers, perform online orders, create sales signs, remodel sales floor, clean sales floor, keep stock room clean and perform various projects"
bad,The hardest part is some sorry management and cut back in hours
bad,"This was my first job dealing  with people and I miss it you walk in clock in and go to the sales floor , since I worked in electronics I knew what new gadgets were coming out and got to demo them as soon as they were released"
bad,"Working in the automotive field is really tough especially when you dont have many hours and your on commission. Especially with customer service, its tough. I dont feel like I am getting paid for the hard work that I do. But I do love working with the people who I currently work with."
bad,Taking inbound calls.  What I've learned is that the company want to make the money but will not share it with the employees.  Management is ok but can still improve.  The hardest part of the job was taking the abuse from customers.  The most enjoyable part was some of the co-workers that worked there.
bad,Sears in a whole is a very successful company. They have been around and succeeded in the business world for over 100 years. Their reputation proceeds them.
bad,"Our team was the escalation department for large house hold appliance's, all of our customers were angry and most of them were yelling, Customers were directed to customer service reps who could not speak English, were rude, hung up on customers or cold transferred them after being on hold for over thirty minutes. The appliance technicians had way too many no shows on customers making them understandably angry and made us use a scripts to talk to the customer by and in turn made the customer more angry! The atmosphere was very tense around me because of the lack of supervision and resources to help the customer. I did meet a good number of friends and have remained friends after the end of my employment."
bad,It was a great place to work . co workers  were o.k. but working retail is hard  . holidays  weekends  you will work.
bad,"Talking and Helping customers"
bad,es una empresa con algunas buenas prestaciones de trabajo y ventas por temporadas ventas nocturnas mis compañeros son gente trabajadora con mucha necesidad como yo la tengo claro lo mas dificil es llenar una cuota de solicitudes de credito que se nos pide cada mes y que todos los empleados batallamos mucho en conseguir ya que la mayoria del tiempo estamos en la tienda preocupados por cubrir la meta de ventas somos cajeros casi almacenistas se nos complica mucho ya que no tenemos sueldo en algunos departamentos por lo cual es importante los clientes para tener mas comisiones
bad,I really like sears. The people at the company are great. I feel very close and happy with the job and the people who work there. I just do not think that in my current position I can advance to become the employee I would like to be.
bad,"I learned to excell my customer service experience, best part of my job were my coworkers"
bad,"i love the speed on a busy work day, i learned how to apply speed at this warehouse and as far as the people they are not very friendly"
bad,"service appliances sell company pa and other co products, you do l. earn repair on all makes and models,all though the management is very pushy with quotas , they want all service done same day reguardlees of your inventory half cant answer you questions  when you run into problems. very demanding management . if you don't sell enough of there product you go on low reports  . I do enjoy most of the co tech they are very helpful ,the enviorment its very neg workplace. I enjoy  most of the customers. the hardest  part of the job is the management and the demands they put on the service techs."
bad,"I loved my job, I did not love the micro management (thanks to corporate, district and regional managers), I loved the people that I worked with.  The complete lack of benefits offered as well as the minimum wage pay with no pay increases in the last 5 years makes it not even worth the headache suffered when dealing with the central regional district, regional, and corporate management."
bad,"No incentives, bonuses or raises, not enough opportunities for advancement."
bad,"Very nice people and associates,with good leaders just wish the pay was better than min wage."
bad,The only thing I can see my self staying at Sears Holdings would be for financial reasons. The managers are horrible and you will never have time for your own personal life family or anything else once you have a schedule don't plan on having it changed
bad,I will admit working at sears was an overall fun experience for me. the staff was great and understanding and everyone got along. training went very welll. Only problem i had was credit. our jobs relied on us selling credit cards. the more cards you sold the more hours you got. I didnt like it at all and when I went to put in my notice for leaving they all wondered why and couldnt understand why it was so difficult for me to get people to sign up for credit cards. 
bad,"I was hired to work as a commissioned jewelry associate, however I was often pulled to work as a cashier in other departments, which limited my ability to make commissioned sales. My pay checks often had to be minimum-wage adjusted."
bad,the company is unfair to its employees and don't like to work with employees lives such as people trying to attend school
bad,"Sears has a Jurassic view of the appliance industry. The have the most market share, and can determine what items ""should"" be sold for, but is hung up on antiquated marketing ideology. Same could be said for most of their other departments. Sears took advantage of the commissioned sales force on a national level. Forcing a 10-20% hidden pay cut from the one division that has continuously provided the most profit opportunity. Not my idea of management."
bad,I know many individuals that work warehouse jobs and the the work they do is no where near as difficult as the backbreaking work you will perform at Sears as an MPU associate and yet you are lucky if you are hired slightly above minimum wage. Although the peaple are great. The pay does not justify the work. Make sure your strong. Unloading appliance trucks by yourself is no joke.
bad,"The work was great but there was a group of emplyees that pretty much ruined the rest of my days. We were salary plus commision and they would skip tickets to get the higher paying jobs, leave for lunch in a group that left us understaffed, and just generally get away with murder. The management was ineffectve at dealing with this group and honestly leaving was a blessing for me."
bad,"Interview new candidates, payroll, conduct new hires orientations, daily store safe count. I got the opportunity to learn from my manager on how to do HR work. My manager left me in charge for one month do to the fact that she went on vacations, I got the opportunity to prove my HR skills and manage the office."
bad,coworkers never spoke spanish
bad,"no set schedule, 30 hours considered fulltime, no company match 401k."
bad,"Overall the company has great worklife balance, but that's almost all that's going for it. The company doesn't give raises, bonuses, or has a 401k. The staff and senior associates are great and a pleasure to work with. Management on the other hand is not. Processes are not structured, there is unequal treatment based on favoritism, ideas are not shared/explored with the group, etc. Projects are consistently scheduled poorly and often lack direction at the beginning. That being said, if you can stick with it, it's a great company to learn at as there are a lot of control gaps and weaknesses, which is fun from an Audit perspective!"
bad,Sears was a great company to work for 15 years ago when I was there. It has changed a great deal in the past few years and not for the better.
bad,"Very fast paced and large volume but understaffed. Management had poor training and unreachable expectations. Overall poorly managed at highest levels, delegated almost all tasks to middle management without sufficient suppost."
bad,"Working at Sears maybe rewarding if you are new and want to gain experience but should not apply if you are a seasoned sales professional. One that you knew you'd be busy all day with. However Sears is on the decline and it shows everyday in its sales numbers and its stock prices. Management is typical drone/normalcy, they are not really a team member style. Advancement is pretty much nonexistent and job security depends entirely on if you read every single line in the handbook. Or if you rather a commission based sales job, your hours are based off CC and rewards applications. Though Sears is very flexible with Work/Life balance (assuming you meet those stated before) and the co-workers seem to help and reassure you. I would recommend Sears as a great first job but nothing beyond that. Get some experience with a big-box retailer and then move on."
bad,Very political and lots of contractors. Flexibility for working at home is supported as needed.
bad,Managment pretty much sucked. Work life balance SUCKED. I had just had my daughter and they gave me a very hard time. reduced my hours to 3 hours a day.
bad,It was an ok company to work for. But it was the people there that made it worth wild. Pay wasnt good nor was the hours for the work that I was doing.
bad,"This job was fun and flexible. The hours were good and my co-workers were fun. Unfortunately, the store is no longer up but it was fun while it lasted."
bad,Company used to be awesome. After ten years and the failing business model it has become a risky place to be involved. Overall there are great people still with. the company but from the management standpoint bot the best place to work.
bad,"Most of the calls were angry calls because people would pay for express shipping and their orders were not sent out.  This was before the Bankruptcy, I don't know if things got any better"
bad,Way too much driving and very little support from management.  You'd average maybe 5 or 6 leads at best. Not nearly enough to maintain a decent income.
bad,"It is no longer the company it once was, unfortunately."
bad,"Day starts with downloading leads in the morning. If it's busy one gets 3-4 leads. Sometimes it's only one and they expect you to get them business by making cold calls. "
bad,"Almost all entry level positions are competitively based. Cashiers have quotas to meet, alongside sales associates that work mainly off of commission."
bad,"While the people I worked with were great, the management was fairly rude and made not only the staff, but in certain cases the shoppers uncomfortable and afraid. Not many benefits except more points for your Shop Your Way account. An okay first job experience, but definitely would not have been my first choice."
bad,"I prefer not to answer, even though I may have had difficulties with aspects of the company others may not and I do not want to sway their opinions on the company."
bad,Buenos compañeros pero si no hay suficientes empleados trabajas horas extras
bad,This place needed work. The management system was terrible. I was sexually harassed by a lead and brought it to Store managements attention. They did nothing but make him apologize.
bad,"sears a good job, with a lot of experience but it was only a temporary job. so I really didn't see the full benefits it had. other than that it was a good job."
bad,"There's a lot of dedicated employees, that do amazing work, despite a CEO that doesn't understand how to develop/grow the business, great learning environment"
bad,My coworkers made this job fun and exciting they were the only reason I stayed as long as I did. Whenever I needed to request days they never approved them. Management was always on you to push credit cards and did not care if you had to trick people t get them so long as you got them to apply. Even had one of the managers suggest lying to the customers in order to get them to apply for the card.
bad,My department has gone through 6 employees quitting in 6 months. I have had papers snatched out my hand by the store manager and management is VERY immature. I have had my issues and proposals disregarded and laughed at on multiple occasions. Truly not a location that values employee input whatsoever.
bad,Every day was a game of roulette and expectations and priorities changed drastically based on which manager had the floor for a given sales day or sometimes a given hour. Employee concerns mostly ignored if even considered at all.
bad,Sears has been a wonderful company for many years. Unfortunately when I began with the company it was on its last leg. The prices of closing many stores pushed me to seek different employment.
bad,"The environment was stressful with constant messes, inconsistent hours, and management guilting you for refusing extra shifts. Coworkers made the job bearable and sometimes fun. Not enough additional hours were provided to staff appropriately at holidays and during resets."
bad,Great job but pay was horrible. Retail job are stressful when HR doesn't train employees well. HR training their employees can facilitate an Asset Protection job much easier when you have an investigation under way. Inventory protection is not due to theft all the time. Most of the time is due to lack of training in the point of sale part of the job.
bad,Only focus on VP's hiring and firing. No clear vision for future. No bonus no salary increase for 2 to 3 years. Only little bit increase after 3 years.
bad,"Management always focused on minute catagories. Instead of focusing on basic Management 101 opportunities like sales plan, credit apps etc.. they would focus on how many signups for SYWR customers(this only benefited CEO as it was one of his side companies)"
bad,Sears is a typical retail job that consists of making customers happy and doing what one is told. It can be sort of fun sometimes but it depends on each specific store and what is going on there at the time.
bad,"No worklife balance in most cases.  Realignments every 6 months or so, and no money to do anything.  All activities/travel were on a zero budget and it was hard to be effective without the travel."
bad,was a good place to work if you like selling items such as kitchen ware and clothing. Was very slow for the majority of the time unless special sale days
bad,Great for any young person that’s still in school great way to get your feet wet and if you pay attention you can learn a lot all in all had a great experience
bad,I worked for Sears when they were paying commissions in the appliance department.  They took that away.  Seemed like Sears was always having financial issues.
bad,at the time I had left they had just been taken over by the kmart ceo and things went downhill from there.  it was not a good place to work if  you wanted to have a lift outside of work
bad,No wonder it is nearly out of business for good this place had terrible customers and even worse management making it an overall unbearable experience.
bad,I do not recommend Sears to anyone. It is a stressful environment and pays very little. If you work as a cashier you have the worst position in the store. The company expects so much from their employees. You need to get certain credit applications a week in order not to get fired. You also need to get good customer feedback's.
bad,this job is okay its not the best. the managers are nice ish as long as you don't have appointments or family emergencies to handle. mostly scanning things and shelving things
bad,"With all the recent changes, workers are now being forced to do triple the work for the same pay which is already less what it should be. Lack of staffing due to either no hours or nobody wanting to do so much work for little pay, or they just up and cut their positions. Attendance is no longer taken seriously either so working here is stressful. All you hear all day is negative customer comments about Sears and asked if this Sears is closing. Or complaints of lack of checkouts (since we were forced to remove most and they were ""centralized"". We're now made to feel like a joke as a company. Sears was a great place to work before they got greedy and became all about metrics. Never should have merged with Kmart!"
bad,"Sears used to be a decent company.  I worked for them a very long time ago.  They used to pay commission and it worked out good if you were going to school and could only work part time.  They are going out of business, and it was easy to see that coming."
bad,If I was still in high school I would recommend it to a friend. It was very difficult working with a lot of women and drama but It was actually a chill job.
bad,"You get the most hour during holidays, after that, you barely work 30 hours. Management will save any money they can by telling you, HR won't pay for certain things when in fact it's apart of the job. So you really have to stay on top of your game at sears and do a lot of footwork to see if you are entitled to the money you deserve."
bad,"I love the employees that worked for sears, the discounts was nice to but I didn't like the management sometimes because of the way they treated some."
bad,Stores are closing not opening not a bright future working for Sears Holdings. Job is ok for temporary or for the fiscal year if the store is profitable.
bad,"I was happy to get the opportunity to work here for a couple days , I got this job through my modelling agency. Helpful employees and great store too!"
bad,"The thing I didn't like the most about working at Sears is I never got a raise, even after working there for two years.  The company, especially the CEO, was disconnected from his employees and the customers."
bad,Great learning experience. I love working with the people. the hardest part was making sure all the customers were stratified. management could have been more hands one with the employees.
bad,I only worked here for 2 weeks. I don't feel like I had enough training for the position I was hired for. I left because I was offered a full-time position at my current position in which I have been at for 8 years.
bad,Sears was an enjoyable place to work.  The pay was decent and the working conditions were nice.  People friendly.  I enjoyed learning about paint and tools
bad,"Once again, this is absolutely irrelevant seeing as how this company is no longer open in Wisconsin.  Any review I gave would be a waste of time.  It should not be required under any circumstances."
bad,"This company is poorly run and managed. To Start, the company's inventory is never up to date. When I was working at Sears as Backroom as associate things were always stocked properly and management was completely incompetent."
bad,"I worked in the backroom, unloading trucks and opening cases of product to get put out on the sales floor. Also, helped customers with online or special orders."
bad,"The work life balance is non-existent. The hours are crazy but at least you get overtime if you are an hourly employee. The department dynamics are different per department, but overall the managers lack team support and they don't stick up for their lower employees. Its a fast paces environment which is fine, but the managers do not understand time management which is why we were always late with deadlines-- which caused us to always feel behind. High stress, toxic, and really just sucked the life out of you. Even if you work really hard and are knowledgeable, they don't really notice you unless you beg and brown nose for a promotion. Peers are great, but managers really need to work harder on actually managing the team and give credit when its due."
bad,"every day was totally different, I just showed up with an ready to go attitude, ready to get things done. it definitely wasn't a dull moment working for sears. The customers were very nice and understandable."
bad,"The Sears Call Center located on 3825 Forsyth road is a great Company to work for. They have great trainers and a Great manager, that are always encouraging you and training the employees so that they can excel and move forward in the company."
bad,You have to do so much and the cashiers there are so underpaid for what they ask you to do. One of the worst retails to work for. Would not recoomend to anyone.
bad,"comenzamos el día con una junta de pre-apertura de ahí nos dirijamos a nuestro punto de venta donde nos registramos comenzamos a mercadear y en tallar las prendas de ropa, y esperamos a que los clientes comienzan a llegar. "
bad,Sears outlet is an extremely slow pace organization only between 10 to 20 personnel.  The culture is fine.  The sales associate are all commission base.
bad,Was berated daily about getting people to sign up for credit cards.  I worked there during the recession so no one wanted to add more debt than they were already in.
bad,"It is tough to be told to do your job when store management doesn't cooperate. They would rather sweep an issue under the rug and forget about it instead of dealing with it in a timely fashion, or at all. The only sure thing was catching shoplifters."
bad,"no opinion, it's been over 8 years since I worked there.  I didn't work for Sears.  I worked for a company that leased space inside the Sears stores so this review is not applicable to Sears"
bad,Working at sears was a first job. It was stressful in that they only had 2 employees in my area and expected us to do everything to take care of the store with no coverage or time.
bad,"Fast work pace, be a team player, can get a workout doing the job, kind of fun, the pay needs to get a little better other then that good job, you learn alot working there."
bad,Worked with some great people over the years but as the company ran into financial difficulties raises stopped and staffing levels decreased which made for a challenging work environment at times.
bad,The company needs structure from top to bottom from management to the employee very stressful when it comes to work performance the machines always breaking down.
bad,I loved this job and didnt mind working for a struggling company but this holiday season was the absolute worst! Customers are intolerable and treat the staff and store like dirt. Upper management relies on lower management to do all the heavy lifting but don't provide the necessary support.
bad,Sears was a retail i worked at for more than 6 years and worked my way up from cashier to running my own department and I wasn't even making $8.00. Retail does not  pay good wages for managers and is not worth
bad,"basically if you did not get enough credit applications, you do not get hours. it was slow and fast paced and the rest of the employees were nice but they were a bit judgmental"
bad,"Job is commission based and has several benefits provided by the company however, they care more about just pushing product out the door and keeping their metrics up (credit apps protection plans etc) than actual over all customer satisfaction and finding the right product for the customer. i predicted before i left that they would be headed towards bankruptcy and out of business and....so far i was right"
bad,"Poor management, with lazy workers that you had to pick up the slack for, the pay was terrible for what the job consisted of. On the bight side the hours were good."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend it, is as simple as that. As a technician there i was having to do jobs i wasn't hired for because lack of personal, specially with that pay rate."
bad,"this individule store was a good place to work, good team work in an organized state"
bad,"enjoyed the colleagues i worked with, we would help each other out when possible but some of them could be sneaky and cut throat, stealing a sale out from under you or talking to a customer after you walk away to get information for said customer"
bad,"I worked at Sears for three years, it was my first real job and there is a lot of favoritism that happens and they love to hire young kids who give horrible customer service."
bad,There is no room for growth. I work as a consultative selling associate. I do well enough in my department and my direct manager is amazing but everything else is at a stand still. There is an incredibly high turn over rate because we are pretty much stuck.
bad,Sears going out of business was due to poor management and the lack of care for the employees. I had a good time working there when I first started but it was awful and hard to come to at the end
bad,"Poor management, from the CEO on down.  Pay is commission based, but Sears considers 30 hours full-time.  Also not located in the busiest of areas.  Vacation hours are accrued on an hours worked basis, beginning after 1 year of work."
bad,"was fun place to work until store closed"
bad,Didn't enjoy the corporate hierarchy only because of the abuse of position and title. As I did sales I would enjoy it at times when I actually helped  people find what they were looking for but the time and pay was not worth it.
bad,"Good customer service experience, but didn't like working and talking on the phone for 8 hours a day.  Most jobs were part-time, which is the reason Sears is going out of business, and no benefits."
bad,Company has forgotten its roots and is all about maximizing your sale instead of taking care of the customer. When I started with the company it took care of the customer as well as the employees. Now it's how much money can we get from the customer.
bad,"Clock in, stay on schedule, embrace each customer while tending to individual tasks and other tasks, beautification of general area, reorganize sales."
bad,All the Techs that I worked with are great employees. The company overall just does not have the management needed to handle the technicians in the field. They may have the book knowledge but hands on previous technicians is what this company needs leading the way. Yes you must know the business side as well but I firmly believe a repair company can not be successful with only college graduates leading the repair side with no experience.
bad,Sears gave its employees a brief training session that did not provide adequate information of goals and objectives for their staff. The shifts were a good length and employees worked well together.
bad,"Not the greatest place to work for. Management is poor, and is not organized. Not a professional environment. The pay as a sales associate is not bad. Overall, I would not recommend."
bad,Management does not set schedules very well. Slow pace of work with not much to do. Gets boring at times. Long days standing in one place. Very little staff structure.
bad,this was my first sales related job and the benefits are almost non existent for part timers. the pay is minimum and it is heavily commission and quota based pay check. environment was stressful to make goals and co workers were client hungry.
bad,You get to learn a lot appliances and how to set the up if you didn't know anything about them. The bad thing about delivery to people home's is when they order something that wouldn't fit through the front door.
bad,"Wasn't the best place. Manager wasn't often on site. Training wasn't provided the way it should have been, a lot of drama with other employees. Unrealistic hours"
bad,"Like in every other company, it is not the company which have a problem, it is the management. The work culture is getting downgraded. Hardest part of the job is resigning after so much of time and efforts made. best part is the team around you."
bad,I did like to go to work because the customers would walk out with a smile on their face. The employers were really nice and they did enjoy working there also.
bad,I really don't have anything to say about this company.  I haven't worked there is so many years that I have no good input.  I just know it is struggling to stay a float.
bad,Once again? You are going to make me do this for all of my past employers aren't you? This really sucks. I don't want to take the time to do this. Blah.
bad,not the most exciting job  management are not the most helpful people when it comes to solving employees problems. Not a lot of training provided with computer software and new systems.
bad,"handle any issues"
bad,"I left Sears a few years after the Kmart merger and saw a sinking boat. The pay was very low but the hours were flexible and I had good coworkers. Your experience with that will be completely on the particular store. "
bad,fun place to work at especially if you are someone who has passion for makeup and. you get to meet different type of people and its a great way to get experience
bad,"It is a good place to work at for a first job. The coworkers are all very nice to work with. Working as a backroom associate, on a daily basis all we do is unload trucks, open up merchandise so the cashiers can set  the merchandise ready for the floor."
bad,"It was an okay place to work, management lacked skills needed to be successful. Often got on their employees about wait time at customer pick up, even when they could not solve the problems."
bad,"Not a good place to work in Sears. No future here. Try to avoid this company as much as possible. "
bad,"All you do is listen to people complain all day. It was a fast passed call center. The place was nice, and movement was awesome. Just left because I moved to Illinois."
bad,When I work at Sears I enjoyed learning the new products. The main reason I left after 5 years was disorganization with Management and high turnover rate.
bad,"A sinking ship with low job security due to the bad performance and total chaos in the upper management level, The compensation is the only enjoyable part."
bad,Was very peer pressured about selling sears credit cards. customers dont speak english they are very foreign. everyday they threaten you to sell more credit cards or else you get fired they also pressure you about shop your way
bad,Management would give their work to hourly workers and take credit for the finished project. Breaks were extremely short and you would be called in if things got busy. You were not allowed to sit or rest of any kind while you were on the floor. You were not allowed to leave at night until the store was spotless. That led to nights where I didn't get home until after 11pm. Chances for advancement or raises were slim.
bad,I worked in a sears in a Mall. It was not a good work environment. My direct manager was good but the store and district manager had not a clue how to run the store and after constant failings on management staff I terminated my relationship with the company.
bad,It was a decent place to work.  Home every morning (overnight runs mostly).  Low salary.  Dedicated runs.  Heavy work as you must unload trailers yourself
bad,Great deal of customer service. Loads of members/customers. Fast pace!!! You will stay busy. Lot's of promotion to remember.
bad,"vraiment très stressant comme emploi, on a beaucoup de pression pour vendre et donner des cartes de crédits."
bad,"While I was here you were only as good as how many people you signed up for credit cards, nothing else mattered.  I would get extra work outside of my job duties due to other people not being able to do it correctly then I would get in trouble for doing the work."
bad,"Just a terrible place to work...............don't recommend it....the management is terrible, the pay is just awful and there was no way to improve or move up,even if you needed or wanted to move up...no full time unless you were a manager....just all around failing company...."
bad,Manager hounded me alot and was rude. he would hide behind objects to watch me and would ask about what shirts he should wear after work. he was very unprofessional
bad,Stores were closing no job security little chance to advance your career.  Worried you would lose your job. Managers were very nice at my store location my store manager exposed me to wonderful projects and career development.
bad,"I worked at Kmart and because of the merging with Sears Holding Inc, they kept on freezing our raises, but still expected us to work very hard for little money. Always had a great group of coworkers though."
bad,As the positions offered are quite disperse the company itself has some severe management issues. As they are in the process of outsourcing every IT position to India i would not recommend this company as a potential employer.
bad,"management didnt care, very minimal hours, terrible upkeep of building, not much else i can remember. They were only working with what they had, Sears seemed desperate for funds and upper management seemed to take it out on store GMs."
bad,I was just starting to work and this was a good job to start with. I didn't have a lot of work experience and they do work with school schedules. Any type of retail in my opinion is good to start with but not good long term.
bad,Company is declining in sales and cutting edge products and processes. I was employed with Sears for 29 years. Good opportunity for advancement. Company cant keep up with cutting edge competition with old fixtures and processes.
bad,"one of the most unprofessional employers I've ever had. Still have not been paid last payroll, and I haven't worked for them in  three weeks."
bad,"Didn't matter how high your sales numbers were, they push hard for more.  Also there were not a lot of customers to generate these sales."
bad,The Company as a whole is out of touch with employees on the lowest rung of the corporate ladder.  It is identified by the upper management not listening to the needs and demands of the associates.
bad,"its ok to work if you are hard up for a job, but if you can do better I would advise that you find a better paying job. other than the pay it was ok to work at. also, sometimes customers are rude but that is to be expected."
bad,I would contact Sears customers via telephone and attempts to sell product maintenance and protection agreements on an average of 50 outgoing calls a day on a part time schedule.
bad,"The hardest part of this job is working for only $4.50 an hour and if we are not busy I don't make any commission. "
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is when I'm helping a customer with placing an order who has a difficult time on the website. I take my time with the customer explaining the product and the features plus I give them the benefits as well to make the sale.
bad,"I learnt many things from sears such as interaction with different kind of customers, work in a fast paced environment, 10 feet rule of customer service and list goes on."
bad,this was my fist job and they did quite a bit of discrimination and with that I didn't approve so I quit and looked for better opportunity.
bad,"Aprendes mucho sobre el trato hacia el cliente, a trabajar en equipo,y sobre precion, los compañeros te apoyan, aveces los gerentes de piso te hacen un poco dificil tu trabajo porque tardan en dar respuesta sobre alguna inconformidad al cliente, y algunos tienen favoritismos"
bad,when i started it was a desent pase but as the time whent on less and less people showed so i would end up days with no work just standing there wich i might say is quight boring.
bad,"Working multiple departments made the job more enjoyable. I was personally able to help in every department, so I constantly stayed busy."
bad,Enjoyed speaking with customers. Concentrated on accuracy of the paperwork and of the customers information. Had to use time management skills to finish by end of day dead line
bad,"Sears was my first job, and I have to say I am glad I no longer work there. The managers were very unprofessional about a number of different things, and they never followed their own rules. Harassment was a huge issue for me at Sears; managers and employees alike harassed me on a daily basis. The only good thing I got out of working at Sears was my customer service and money-handling experience."
bad,"Did a lot of changes in the past 5 years. However, they are to heavy in upper management."
bad,Sears was a company that would support you if you were in a store with good management. The hours were long and the pay wasnt always good. they stopped giving raises but still a good company overall
bad,"If considering a job at Sears, try to find a connection to someone in that department/area of the company to get the ""real scoop"" on what it's like to work there.  Some parts of the company are fine and offer intriguing challenges, while other parts could mean constant fire drills without the resources to adequately address them."
bad,The work/life balance was very good. There was time off to spend with the family. The work was a challenge sometimes but that is what made it interesting.
bad,"Gained customer service experience, cash register and computer skills, learned about merchandising. I gained skills and friendship with staff members and customers. Was a very fast paced environment at times"
bad,not many areas for advancement workers are pushed with little or no training managers are required to manage day and night
bad,It was a good place to work and pick up Loss Prevention skills. Loss Prevention training classes were seldom and not given as frequent as they should. Chances of growing in the company was infrequent.
bad,"""selling"" credit Cards to Customers is a really big thing there, if anything they look at that and make that a huge thing, if you don't sell enough your getting chewed out. so basically selling credit cards is more your job than being a cashier. some managers don't know how to work with people and don't realize everyone learns differently. there's this one manager who was constantly trying to role-play with everyone. if anything it made everyone feel very uncomfortable and uneasy.  I have also seen many times, other people with different job titles do things like have to help on the register while not being a cashier, as well as helping out in the backroom and many others."
bad,"I helped customers check out with their merchandise and worked to persuade them into acquiring Sears credit cards, the pressure for which proved immense."
bad,Managers are really on your back about selling credit cards more than on your customer service reports. Co-workers have drama and are not willing to help each other out.
bad,Lie to customers about store credit cards to fill a quota. When you're not doing that you clean up the store. Then you get back to the register and lie to more customers about credit cards again.
bad,"Company is not as respected as it has been in the past.Numerous store closings have caused serious decline in moral and confidence in management.Raises in compensation were suspended in 2006,lack of funding for remodels and updates have caused stores to appear old and dated."
bad,"Mattress sales associate, Cashier, and Footwear sales associate"
bad,"The general process of anything in Sears is flawed. The logic behind policy is skewed and the result is a lack of function. There is a very high turn over, and it is very common for many associates to only work a few months before quitting."
bad,A typical day is okay. I gained a lot of customer service experience from working here. The hardest part would be having consistent hours which doesn't really happen often. The most enjoyable part is the environment and my co-workers. Being able to aid customer is also a plus for this job.
bad,"Sears is great for workers looking to work part-time for minimum wage. However, being in management, raises are not available as well as promotions. I do love the people I work with and the members we serve!"
bad,"My typical day there was booking appointments, taking photographs, running a register and general customer service.  I learned a lot about photography.  The management was fine but the company was failing.  I enjoyed my co-workers and the customers.  The hardest part of that job was watching it fail.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning the job."
bad,"Working for an ailing/money losing retailer is a challenge in itself.  Having your amount of hours worked determined by how many Sears credit cards you were able to sign the customer up for along w/a customer base that if they did not already have an account frequently said they had just paid off all their cards, Sears included, and had no interest, in the current economy, taking on additional debt."
bad,Check dressing rooms and remove items of clothing left in them. Check to be sure clothes are proper folded and placed in order from smallest to largest. Put up new sale signs on weekly basis. Check prices for sales associates as needed.
bad,good place for growth for entry level job. low level associates fun to work with and have good team spirit. enjoyable part is working with people on same level as you
bad,"I have learned a lot working for Sears and I have invested a lot of time with them. I love my co-workers along with all of the employees there. I even love the different challenges we get working there, however the company seems to be in a liquidation and does not provide the opportunities I need to meet my long term goals and establish my future. I am now searching for a company that invests in their employees, provides career advancement opportunities, and treats them like family."
bad,I worked in sears for 3 month as a seasonal job and I learned team working and better customer services. My coworkers were friendly.
bad,"The franchise model is very badly structured, flies most of the time like you are competing against yourself instead of getting support"
bad,The maturity levels of the employees does not help retain qualified personnel to work there.  Most co-workers don't approve of Loss Prevention.
bad,"Not a very laid back job, must be good selling credit cards or you won't last. The people you work with are super nice but the head cashier manager can be rude. The hardest part was to meet all the unrealistic goals which depend on how many hours you work, including selling credit cards."
bad,"-The work day is very busy; a lot of meetings and tight deadlines. The tactical portion of the director position does not allow for broad macro strategy discussions"
bad,"Over all the work place is good, but the icing on the cake is the incredible people that you get to work with.  Its almost like a family environment.  They are supportive an always there for you, I have made life long friends from there."
bad,"Call center setting, usually frustrating. Have to have thick skin, customers can be very rude and hurtful"
bad,"Sears was an ok job with some problems. The most enjoyable part of my job, and the only part I cared about was helping my customers."
bad,Good job and a good company to work for. Co-workers made the day go good
bad,"I did a lot of things at Sears . Worked on riding and push lawnmowers  , assy. of bikes and bb-q pits beds and baby cribs. Drove a fork lift to unload trucks. Processed a lot of the returned goods helped out in the display dept."
bad,The pay is very low compare to all the work you will be doing. There isn't enough team work.
bad,Sears has a lot of opportunity for growth. Associates who are motivated can move up quickly. They need to show a certain drive and tenacity though.
bad,"Depending on the day, sales will be slow but we make goal. Management for some are good, others lake and don't step their game up. Most enjoyable part about the job is working with some of my employees that make the job fun. There's always a hard part working in the retail world and dealing with customers and management but I take it as a new learning experience with challenges."
bad,I started with this company at the age of 18.  Started as general labour unloading trucks.  Was able to move into operating mobile equipment and was trained on forklifts and order pickers. After 8 years in this environment I felt I was as far as I could go and not many opportunities to advance where available.
bad,I would never work at Sears again. Sears has steadily been on the decline and management is the reason why.
bad,"My personal experiences and opinions aren't great, so I'll keep them to myself. It wasn't a good fit."
bad,All they care about is you getting customers to sign up for credit cards.
bad,"No one knew what was going on, Managers were dismissive. Very very poor management team."
bad,"A typical day at work was helping staff reach sales goals, delegating tasks and helping the team work together to fulfill any requirements needed. Customer relations and problem solving. Listening to customers and making sure they are left feeling good about the company and there experience. I learned a lot about many products. Management sometimes struggled with being present when needed but it just made me learn how to resolve more issues on my own. The hardest part of the job was helping people who just wanted to complain and not come to a resolution. The most enjoyable part of my job was working for my staff to make a smooth running happy work environment."
bad,There was four different store managers throughout the time i worked there. They all had different issues which led to them being fired.
bad,The work environment was very slow which created a feel of boredom. staff seemed very unhappy. Management were not strong leaders in leading a great productive team.
bad,I learned how to become a photographer without having any previous training. I love the interaction I had with children and families and making children be able to smile for the moment of a lifetime!
bad,Answer incoming calls from customers wanting to set appointments for a home improvement project.
bad,Nice staff and found this position easily as it was seriously needed.
bad,Sears was not what I was looking for and I moved to quick to form a true Summary
bad,Sears Holding is a decent place to work however the management is lacking in technical ability and leadership is lacking all the way around. My co-workers are wonderful and hard working people that make the day to day life enjoyable.
bad,"I worked for Sears Commercial for almost 13 years selling appliances to the B-B market with an annual volume of about 2 million. I went on sick leave for 13 weeks. A month later I was told my position was gone, as my volume dropped!! Try finding a new job when you are  over 60"
bad,"workplace offers little in the way of employee benefits, lacks focus on promoting individuals who show outstanding performance in exchange for promotion of persons based on lowest possible payout"
bad,"Meeting and helping people everyday. Always have something to do, staying busy makes the time go by."
bad,The lack of hours and interaction of other staff. Was not bad but I needed a more secure job and a job I could better ulilize my skills and personality. Plus I did not do well being attached to a phone all day.
bad,the job was fast paced so the hours go by really fast but sometimes there are very rude customers and other times there are very nice customers who tip very well
bad,"Uncomfortable place to be.  Great co-workers, but fear and no security was prelevant."
bad,"not a graet place to work"
bad,Love interacting with the different kinds of customers that Sears gets.
bad,The part of working at Sears would be knowing all of the awesome deals before hand. The customers really do appreciate the discounts that they offer every weekend.
bad,J'aime travailler avec le public. C'est l'aspect le plus agréable pour moi.
bad,"My number one complaint about Sears is that the stores are horribly mismanaged. A major problem that I continuously have is that of how corporate is continuously changing and redesigning the floors. More stock is continuously needing to be put away, and management is always wanting me to learn new things about my job, yet they are not providing me the hours needed to do all of this."
bad,"I was never busy, the management was scattered. All of the employees were very unhappy about coming into work there."
bad,Management was somewhat helpful but always blamed others for their mistakes. Sometimes management would cut your lunches because they needed you else where.
bad,"I really enjoy the people I work with and my work environment, but the compensation for our work is horrible. Their turn-over rate is not good at all. I have had an excellent learning experience, but I am ready to move on."
bad,"Need to be fast pace when crowded; usually on the weekends."
bad,"Typical day at work, only greeted about 6 people a day. Store was extremely slow. In order to make a decent paycheck, had to hope someone came in looking to rebuild their kitchen or build a new home"
bad,"A typical day at sears is slow business"
bad,"Great company to work for, they work with your schedule. This is a job that I would work for as a secondary."
bad,After I received a honorable discharge life was not going to be the same looking for a job that would pay me what I was worth.
bad,"I worked at the Sears in Colonial Heights. At first when I got hired, I absolutely loved my job. After about 4 months of working there, management ended up changing, and the environment of the workplace turned for the worst. The current hardlines manager is a very sexist male. He has something against female employees. I would not recommend working in this workplace if you are a female."
bad,"Started at sears while in High School. They worked with my schedule, and you were able to see the new trends in clothing."
bad,Job sucked and pay sucked. Training was very lackluster. Definitely would not work recommend it to anyone.
bad,I was a cashier so I would come into work and ring up customers. Was a very fun job
bad,company is enjoyable to work for. overall positive experience
bad,"A typical day at work taking vital signs, feeding, bed bath, charting, transfer patient from wheel chair to bed. I learn how to help different types of patients and how to care for there needs. There is great management team they are caring and understanding. The co worker are very helpful they assist you with helping the residents moving bed to wheel chair and rang of motion. the job is not hard at all just some time it gets over whelming. The enjoyable part of the job is making the patient comfortable."
bad,I worked back at the docking department where I was constant put under pressure from my supervisors.  They all said I wasn't moving fast enough when I was going as fast as I possibly could.
bad,doesn't provide enough training to employees. fails to provide work.
bad,"Love the people I was working with. What a great team! The managers are supportive and teach so much. The two biggest issues are the schedule and pay. You don't  know your schedule for the day until around 8am. You may have to leave immediately to get to your first appointment and you may not be home till midnight. This happens often. You just have to go where the appointments are. You have no control over your schedule. The pay is 100% commission. This is very tough. You may have a pay period where you get a check for $4,000 and several where you only receive $200. Its very up and down. Love the job though. The customers are so much fun and the products are top quality. You can be proud of the company and products you present."
bad,"cashier"
bad,I enjoy merchandising and working with receiving and creating weekly ads. I am in close contact with customers day in and day out. Management is constantly trying new tactics to improve the overall business. This can be difficult to keep up with at times. I enjoy the team I work with. The hours and benefits are less than desirable and I often to do not have enough time to complete my tasks.
bad,"Pay increase is very important these days, with raises being on freeze dont expect one."
bad,"its a job, they play with the scheduling, you dont get paid enough for what you do, coworkers are friendly, the managers who know what they're doing are helpful."
bad,Help many different clients and learn new computer systems.
bad,"Sears has too fast and to much turn-around, hard to ground work in a constant changing organization."
bad,"Great for learning about photography basics, and learning about responsibility as a young adult.  However, a photographer can often be asked to work on a tight and unrealistic schedule."
bad,"pulling orders,stocking and loading trucks learned and a lot of tools and machines management was very nice and helpful"
bad,"This place was chaotic. The management team had no control over the automotive techs, or the service writers. Training was nonexistent too."
bad,For a 1st time job sears is okay but not long term. i would not recommend this job to anyone. my managers were rude and didnt have manners at all.
bad,"The place was fine to work for, not too dirty. Just none of the management like anyone taking off, even if it was due to a medical emergency with your family."
bad,A typical day at SEARS was always very busy but it was an overall great experience. I served as a cashier here for six months which gave me a wonderful experience in the retail business. Some of the management did not really know how to talk or address their employees the right way but it was a work in progress. The hardest part of my job was just keeping up with certain Credit goals for the month but I always managed to stay on top. However the best part of the job would have to be the customers. You can never go into work sad and come out sad because your customers would always give you something to smile about. There was nothing better than knowing that you was providing help and support to someone else. Your customers are always right and you want to have them happy.
bad,"You get paid 7.25hr plus commission IF you get someone to sign up for a credit card. Which no one really does unless you lie to them and I hate lying. I and many others got laid off because we didn't make any progress in the credit card sales. I was pregnant at the time and one of the best cashiers there! That wasn't enough for them...this job is not for you if you are not a good salesman."
bad,quickly learned this was a job for kids who were just starting to work.
bad,repair broken equipment on demand to keep production going
bad,"I enjoyed working with most of the people in the store, and for a store as large as Sears, that's impressive.  The only real drawbacks were that I was there for 2 years and only 2 opportunities for advancement were presented and during the summer, it was sometimes cooler outside than it was in the store."
bad,"Sears is a wonderful place to be employed if you are looking for nothing more than to make a paycheck, but not the place you would like to be if advancement is your goal. I have gained vast knowledge about customer service & how to handle irate customers while at Sears, which is a good thing. The employees are kind & welcoming, which makes the workday a little easier to work through."
bad,A typical day consisted of assisting customers fulfill their hardware and lawn and garden needs. Extensive knowledge of lawn equipment and hardware was a necessity. The company as a whole was poorly managed.
bad,"Sears Holdings Inc. is full of good, hard working employees. Unfortunately, the company is poorly run. Members of management are overworked and underpaid.  Corporate communication is either confusing, conflicting, or miscommunicated in many cases.  There is no retirement option available to management, health care is extremely expensive, and 401 K is a joke."
bad,"loved the atmosphere and coworkers I worked with, would go back if I could"
bad,The staff was great but management was not so great. Customers were great to be round. The hardest part is management of the store and how nothing was organized properly.
bad,Sears was fun to work at first but then everything slipped down the drain. They got a new cashier lead and he had no clue what he was doing. It was just not ran the it should have been
bad,"I didnt like this job at all, all i did all day was stand around. It was a waste of time, and i like to be hands on."
bad,"employees were great, management sucks, my co-workers were great i loved them"
bad,Sears is a good place to work for. I miss working security for them.
bad,This was just a quick and easy pay job for when I was younger. My route was fairly small with average 80 customers.
bad,My first assigned job at the company was working in automotive side and focusing on sales and the customers best interests. Later i was promoted to assistant manager in the jewelry department and in the kids clothing. My main respondsibilty was to take inventory of the jewelry and keep track of sales.
bad,Not a very pleasant place to work. The pressure put on employees to sell merchandise is very overwhelming and not worth the compensation. The overall morale is poor because of the management.
bad,Numerous years working through the entry level to the position I am currently in has proven to be a great asset in the education process. Learning how to address customer issues and how to handle associate situations with diplomacy and tact have help to develop strong communication skills. To be a support for those who look up to you and be able to motivate individuals in demanding situations have shown that with the right tools anyone can better themselves for not only their benefit but for the benefit of others as well.
bad,"Constant change in workload, unstable stressful environment, never stay consistent (never know what to expect from day to day)."
bad,High turn over Seemed like every day people were scared that was the day the company was going to close its doors. Very unstable work environment.
bad,"being a sales associate was a pretty good job and i enjoyed it for the 2 years i worked there, however, management was not too organized and my co-workers at the time were very rude and not willing to help someone who needed some support in various occasions such as transactions, how to assist a customer and what to say to a customer and announcements. The most enjoyable part of this job which kept me there for 2 years is honestly how grateful the customers were and how awesome customer service was."
bad,Management needs to be trained and brought up to speed with employment laws.
bad,"unloaded trucks, stocked shelves never made any progress pay wise. started at 10.00 and stayed there and was overlooked for management positions"
bad,great work enviorment .... not good for job security... easy job
bad,"My day started at 6 am everyday. Managers where there to help u learn or needed help with anything, but for the most part left the stocker to them selves. The hardest part of the day was getting the delivery truck from the warehouse to the store on time."
bad,"would have eight hour shifts, either working alone or with another coworker on the cashier line, always got to help the worker that put the murchent out. management didnt seem to care about all the employees only if you got the sales wasnt very fair to the hours everyone worked, did seem to want everyone to do there best and to ask help if need be, always there to lend an ear. coworkers you usally worked by your self in one cashier line. but seemed all friendly towards eachother. hardest part was during black friday had to work12 hr shift and everything was crazy in stores, my enjoyable part was learning something new besides the banking area."
bad,most jobs are based off commision so beware and make sure your head is where its suppose to be to make those Sales! goodluck!
bad,Retail teaches you a lot. i liked working there just wasnt my ideal place
bad,"Low pay rates"
bad,"OK staff"
bad,the management wasn't very helpful and some where known for being very flirtations with the female staff yet they had never been told to stop.
bad,its work it pays but not very professional. i didn't hate working there i would work there again but only if i couldn't find anything else.
bad,"•Perform the tasks of handling customer calls regarding the request of services and products "
bad,"a typical day at work would be opening/counting cash drawers. KEEPING TRACK OF CREDIT APPS/ SYWR SIGN UPS/ STH/ AND ALWAYS KEEPING YOUR REGISTER PERCENTAGES ABOVE 80% anything lower isn't acceptable. keeping cash reps clean and tidy, emptying trash and hangers. helping MCA's with put-backs. the most enjoyable part of the job can also be the hardest, getting customers to sing up for a sears card. "
bad,fairly easy work but not enough work. Minimum hours even for full time. orentation is on a computer not hands on. Credit applications are too much!
bad,"- poor management"
bad,"This job fulfilled the needs that I had when I was younger, but the whole set up of this store was unorganized and made for a bad working environment. The management team was never organized and nothing was ever done the right way. I learned a lot from this experience because often times it is the not so perfect situations that you learn how not to do things. This is a productive learning tactic. The hardest part of my job was trying to fix the mistakes and lazy errors of others around me. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenges I faced because of the situation."
bad,"The best thing about working at this company are the people you get to work with. Other than that the company itself is poorly ran and despite the fact that your coworkers may be friendly, a good amount are poorly trained and/or incompetent."
bad,Sears was my first job right out of high school. This job taught me to work in teams with other members who were there to clean and assist customers. My co-workers were young individuals who were working in order to support themselves in school. the hardest part of the job was cleaning the fitting rooms. Sometimes it was stressful having to clean the fitting rooms while also assisting difficult customers.
bad,"Hard work, but fulfilling. Opportunity to learn other departments."
bad,"Get in early and operate forklift. Pull orders to be placed on delivery trucks. Go to receiving docks and unload appliances then put them into our inventory. hardest thing at the job is there was not to many hours available to work, once we were done we were sent home."
bad,Didnt really like working with some of the supervisors and employees but you had opportunity to improve your check if you wanted
bad,"Stable company, Fun Employees, Too much emphasis on Credit income and miscelanous income. Culture is that of ""do it or else"" from district manager, Threatened all the time from regional down to district manager to store."
bad,"If you're a female I would not apply for this position. I worked in the lawn & garden department, and it was very hard to sell with all the males in the department trying to take advantage of you."
bad,this location wasnt good with my scheduling to to the fact thta i had to go to school
bad,I would have to average 4 sales every 100 calls. They always had little incentives and races daily to get us even more enthused about our sales.
bad,The internship program was a great start to my career. I learned a great deal about supply chain management through completing challenging projects for the company.
bad,Did not give enough hours during of season. Training wa good though.
bad,I LOVE being a photographer and working with people and kids. The company has gone down hill and is loosing money because they are making unwise decisions. We never know if we will have a job the next day.
bad,Achieve optimal levels of personal performance and accomplishment. 
bad,"There was alot of corners that were being cut when it came to daily operations. I worked hard for over a year without any opportunity for advancement nor did I recieve the raise that I was promised. I went above and beyond my duties that were in my job description in hopes that my efforts would be noticed because I was told that work opportunities and hours would be rewarded to those who work hard and deserve it. That wasnt the case for me which made it even harder to understand because I was the only employee in my position and I still wasnt given the hours that I deserved. Other than that, the environment was very open and helpful amongst the rest of the employees. There was always good chemistry between myself and the rest of the automotive technitcians and sales associates simply because they were very thankful and would recognize the hard work that I performed. During my time employed at Sears Automotive, our shop would rank #1 in the nation in sales as well as our sales profit margine leaped by 30+% because of my re-organizing and re-formatting of the shop stock rooms and merchandise."
bad,Management very lazy not willing to help associates. The hardest part about my job is dealing with rude and mean customers and not being able to solve their problems and meet their needs.
bad,"100% Commission jobs are tough. The work environment wasn't too bad. Naturally, it was competitive. Most everyone got along, including management. The store closed due to lack of sales. If you don't mind staying on your toes and competing for pay, then you'll love it."
bad,Selling Protection Agreements to preexisting customers.
bad,"clocked in, no advancement, not good, fine, sales, not using own gas"
bad,A typical day at this job was for me to come in and make sure all the clothes and things were in order.The manager and co-workers were good people.There was not really a hard part.
bad,"The store is not always properly managed. The good thing about that is as a professional employee, you are able to shine, and show your value to the company by wearing many hats."
bad,"Did returns, exchanges and regualr monetary transactions. would help clean area and sort clothing. Would try to sell sears credit card to customers. I have worked retail before, and I learned how to open and close registers. My manager was amazing, she made the whole experience better and tried really hard to be fair with schedules and get everyone more hours to work. Really nice and fun to be around every day. Hardest part was not getting more hours, more pay or a chance to move up in company. Most enjoyable was being around the manager, she was truly a great leader for sears."
bad,Make sure customers were well assisted and i learn that the customer came first while working at Sears.The management were very helpful.
bad,"-shooting portraits, editing, selling"
bad,Straighten up the floor. Help customers find what they were looking for if they needed any.
bad,This job is selling maintenance agreements on the phone. If your good at selling then this is the job for you.
bad,Changes happen without regard for agents needs. it was good for a while but with new management comes new guidelines and well its not always in the best interest of its employees.
bad,"Sears is a good work environment. I've learned how to conduct and manage sales as a sales consultant. There are two types of managers you will encounter. There are some really nice managers that will help you with whatever you need and there are several managers that will make you feel like they want you out. If they want to get rid of you, they will either find a way by either have you arrested and handcuff you so everyone can see you be escorted by the police (we call this the walk of shame) or hopefully trap you in a presupposition question where they ask you leading question make you take a blame you didn't do and fire you on the spot and the other way to rid of you is give you 3 working hours for the entire week so you can quit. This is a method they use to make sure you do not apply for unemployment. So be careful. Do note however, I don't think every SEARS management does this practice. I am currently doing further investigation on this matter. The previous management were great, but now that they have moved on, the current top store managers just sunk. Again, the lower managers are great but not the top managers of the store. The co-workers are great and friendly and will try to help you in every way possible. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and listen to them by telling you devaluing insults, demoralizing comments, and telling you unspeakable foul language at you for following company policy and you have to stand there with a smile on your face and take it all in to remain professional. Managers deal with this too, not just regular associates."
bad,Was a good company but too many other companies competing now.
bad,"Great place to work, just not enough hours and wages to provide for me and my child."
bad,Not enough statements due to working there temporary. The people are nice. The hardest part of the job is to get the Hr to understand me.
bad,The management is OK they can be annoying at times. but the job was pretty much laid back..but there wasn't enough hours
bad,"worked for short time during the holiday season, was no longer needed"
bad,"Company constantly changing directions every 2-3 months, unstable"
bad,Did not have enough hours to support my needs. Expected you to force their credit card on customers and if you did not receive enough credit applications you were punished with a severe cut in hours. The hardest part of the job was not having enough work to keep you busy. During the slow hours there is only so much side work to be done while not ringing customers.
bad,The reason for not working at sears again is that there is a lack of management. They are never around when employee needs help
bad,Previously working there at Sears Automotive I've encountered my management to be shady(Meaning they're not quite the person I would bring my car to). I was told to do something that would go against my integrity and I was shortly gone after I did not do it.
bad,"This was my first real job, and it was ok as far as retail goes. There seemed to always be a lot of drama in the work place. I was hired as seasonal and was told that I wouldn't be kept on after the holidays."
bad,A typical day consists of exemplary customer service that meets satisfaction. Along with keeping coworkers enthusiastically involved. The job has taught me organization skills and patience.
bad,Unstable workplace.  Hard to work for a company that has no future. Management were fair and kind. I enjoyed the people at this company. Most employees have a very long work history.
bad,"Seems the company wastes a lot. A lot of items were thrown away when not needed. Even though there are stores close by that could have used them instead of having to purchase the items."
bad,There weren’t enough cashiers I Would always be by myself if we’re to become ill they would tell I couldn’t leave because there was nobody else. One manager thought she was way better than everybody else and would put everybody down for no reason. Talk to you badly and completely disrespectful. That Job is way too stressful and horrible for the minimum wage they are paying.
bad,Sears was a place to work while you are looking for other opportunities. Great place to gain experience in sales and customer service. Too much down time at times.
bad,"Coming into the Kmart and getting the money from the vault for the front registers and bringing it up to the front service desk is the start of the day. As the cashiers begin coming in and signing out their tills,  begin working on scheduling breaks and lunch according to the order of their shift and when they arrived. I also ring sales, take in returns, make money orders and handle all Western Union transactions. I also make sure the customer service desk money drawer is balanced every hour since  am constantly in it and making change for cashiers an time they might need it."
bad,"Sears is a company that is slowly losing its sales. For the reason, a typical day at Sears is very slow. Therefore, I did not get the desired amount of hours I wanted to work. Besides that, I did learn a few things while working here. For example I learned how to handle customer complaints and learned how to have more customers sign up for the stores credit cards. The management at the store was great. The managers were very nice and friendly. The hardest part of this job were the rude costumers. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to meet new people and talking to costumers."
bad,"En la empresa Sears Operadora México me ""brindan"" la facilidad de horario, para así poder estudiar y trabajar al mismo tiempo."
bad,Started as a PM Tech.  Took a year to become a full Service Repair tech.  Non crazy day was typically 4-7 calls of varying pm check ups to a system making a noise to maybe a part being needed.  Toss in the driving and it equaled out to a normal day.
bad,as LP we were in the camera room a lot and we could also walk the floor. it was good when I was the lead. easy laid back had a lot of shoplifters. Management was good also and helpfull
bad,Sears was my first job and didn't take me long to learn the ropes of retail with awesome pay. The management at Sears is a joke though and is the reason why several employees have left.
bad,A fairly depressing place to work as the company has been in a death spiral for a long time and everyone there is just waiting for someone to decide to close our store.  There's essentially no way to advance and it likely won't be around long enough for there to be anywhere to advance to.  Management are generally fine people.
bad,There is a great deal of drama in any commission job. Some days you can go in and sell something. Other days can be completely dead. Its hard to have a consistent paycheck
bad,"Helping customers find the appropriate merchandise that best fits their interest. Learning the different concepts of the retail industry and making sure each customer is well taken care of, while multitasking."
bad,"I was not supervised and I was expected to complete given tasks but how and when I completed them was up to me which was very relaxing. However, my coworkers often left whatever miscellaneous things in my room expecting me to deal with it. This was ultimately the reason for my resignation. During my last week a coworker I was fond of told me it was ridiculous how I was treated by my own coworkers. Each day I was expected to simply remove as much store stock from my room as possible. It taught me time management as well as task organization. Management typically stayed away. The best part of the job must have been the privacy."
bad,"The store is a good workplace, and all of the workers had fun together, we got work done and just had a great time. The fine jewelry department we had competitive sales, i had to open and close the safe and store at the end of the day i locked the store put the jewelry in the safe and clocked out"
bad,"Everyday is different, ranging from appliance sales to customer problem solving and appliance trouble shooting. While the company is slowly closing stores and selling off assets, I did learn many invaluable skills in customer and sales skills."
bad,The hours if you are part time fluctuate so much its hard to develop a rhythm. Management in regards to supervisors they were the best but managers are very busy so hard to get a hold of
bad,it sucked my manger was mean to everyone yelling an just plain rude. I learned how to work on there computers and the check was the best part at the time about the job.
bad,"I enjoyed my work place at Sears because the great staff that I worked with. The management was great because they helped on the floor when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when staff helped each other, and they can make each other laugh."
bad,I learn a lot about sales and using the cashier how to do returns and credit. It was fun working there because I like interacting and helping people.
bad,"Sears needs to go back to the old days when they had people actually working in each department that KNEW the products and actually knew how to a help a customer. I worked there 23 years and I trained people to help the customer and sell products.  They don't do that now."
bad,The technology used is cutting edge but the management seems direction less. The expectation changes daily and every decision is based on 'On the Fly' process.
bad,"Muy buena empresa para ascender en el ambito de las ventas , desgraciadamente podias ascender con miras a ser jefa de piso de ventas y eso no era mi aspiracion laboral,"
bad,"The company was not heading in the right direction.  The people I worked with were great.  However, budget cuts and job security were big issues."
bad,"sears logistic services is fun work place ,and year after year you learn a lot of stuff,find anything in resume please,communication is the key to get the job done with safety way"
bad,"A typical day at work for Sears generally starts in the morning.  Several managers would fight over scheduling and a lot of the time I was left as the only cashier for the better part of the day.  There is constant pushing customers to sign up for store credit cards which isn't bad in moderation, but they require you to badger the customer into a fowl mood that completely ruins the experience for them and leaves you, the cashier, with an aggravated member on your hands.  Scheduled lunches?  Forget it. Getting your lunch at a reasonable time is like trying to nail jell-o to a tree in the middle of Summer.  The managers for both soft lines and hard lines were always in a constant power battle with each other and often times, your schedule would be changed no less than 4 times without your knowledge or consent.  If that wasn't stressful enough, you as an employee were often caught between 2 managers.  One tells you to do this, the other wants the exact opposite."
bad,I enjoyed my position. I had a good management team and worked in a great team.
bad,"people in the shop are easily to get along with, it is just management was bad, all they cared about was making a buck and not worried about the workers there."
bad,"Sears is a very customer service based environment, employees and customers of Sears are very enjoyable to be around. "
bad,"Very little customer volume, management not supportive, policies and procedures and Computers are not very efficient. The company is family oriented however."
bad,"• Dispatched service orders to a region of approximately 300 technicians, communicated daily with "
bad,"This is a high stress job in a company hit hard by the recession, but the culture and direct management is enjoyable and there are several opportunities to gain a broad spectrum of skills and knowledge."
bad,"Ink tag, mpu, receiving, cart run."
bad,Go in and make phone calls to Sears customers via telephone. Usually call about 100 customers on a typical day. The purpose of our call is to acquire business by selling them Protection Agreements or to maintain business by renewing their Protection Agreements.
bad,"show up for work,do the work orders on the board if any sells, getting them done right away yery hard to take breaks lunches"
bad,"lack of hours,they have values and treat everybody with a high leave of respect.i would mind working with them again."
bad,"I was in human resources and had to go through everyone's file for their write offs. I wrote the reports on each person so that upper management could decide which people to layoff. It was a good job because of the people working there but the company itself was awful. I can't stand their policies with repair for their appliances and they left a lot of people high and dry. They overcharged and never had the right parts to fix the appliance the first time. This was not the workers but the company policies. Awful, account draining policies."
bad,"great place to have worked for its sad the direction Sears is going."
bad,It was a good experiences. All my coworkers were cool and easy to get along with. I learned a lot working there but unfortunately they had to lay-off and I made the cut
bad,The store manager is afforded unfair control over subordinates futures without cross-referenced backup verification this resulted in unsupported managers
bad,Company went bankrupt and thousands lost their careers.  Poor management decesions were made. Incapable mangement replaced furstrated quality leaders.
bad,Sears was an incredible place to work.  I learned a lot in my time there and had overall great leaders and teams to work with.  Unfortunately the organization was not able to overcome their identity crisis.
bad,Unfortunately I worked at Kmart side of the Sears.  I was really sad that had to endure 2 store closing within 1.5 years.  I did not agree with many of the changes.
bad,"with this job I was constantly being the only worker to clean one department, now that would've been fine if they have 2 or more people throughout the week helping me with the department but for days, they would leave my department messed up (off days) and expect me to clean everything up before the end of my next shift. lack of GROUP EFFORT"
bad,outstanding Staffing management understanding excellent training with ability to grow within company people-friendly verbally respectful great benefits.
bad,"It was a part time job.  It has a lot of responsibility for the pay they provided.  My manager was excellent.   To get benefits you had to work full time, and those jobs were far and few."
bad,I would not recommend starting a career with Sears as the company has been on a down hill slide for many years and are possibly close to closing for good.
bad,They were rude and not understanding.  Unfair treartment was given to specifc employees.  The managers were not sufficient and attentive to overlooking the cashiers and sales associates...
bad,The company has a great culture and it is a very easy place to work at. However the pay is not good. Also just like most retail stores not many hours.
bad,"I can't beleive it, we are closing all kimarts and sears. This is a shame.Why do they lie to us. Just why why ehy why. How is this earesa e"
bad,Has a tv and breake room with wifi ive learned alot their working about a month co workers are like family typical day of work would be walk in say hi to everyone and wait for carsto cone into the shop to work pn
bad,Enjoyed going to customers home and diagnosing the problem with appliance and replacing broken parts. Really enjoyed repairs.
bad,"If only the CEO and VPs knew!!!!!!!Some of the mangers are horrible.My experience was great in the beginning.Even after.You are seperated into teams,Which means you get a different manger when it was time to rotate. I only had a promblem with maybe 2 or 3 mangers.The coworkers were friendly.Some of the mangers were wonderful.Can't say that about all.The benefits were okay,and  the incentives could be awesome.If I had the opportunity to work at the call center again I would. The best part for me were the set  schedules.The worst part was the unprofessional behaviors of some management and supervisors."
bad,"Took a struggling Home Improvement department from 468 out of 761 in the company to 15th in the company. Strong team leader adept at molding and training of associates to become the best they can be. Very strong leadership skills."
bad,I stock shelves and change displays. I update pricing and signage. I assist customers with in store and online purchases. I keep the appearance of the store neat and clean
bad,es una empresa muy buena con un buen ambiente de trabajo pero casi no dan bases
bad,"I supervised 10 associates monitoring and coaching them to be successful in selling appliances while maintaining my own sales per hour quota. The hardest part of the job was actually the most enjoyable part as well, that being motivating my co-workers to be successful while maintaining the high standards of customer service."
bad,A typical day at work can vary you have your busy days along with some days that drag but I manage to get through both situations. I have learned not every customer has the same approach on the same situation. Management rarely has to get on my case. My co workers aren't hard people to get along with I pretty much get along with everybody. The hardest part of my job is metrics because you will often get the customer who wants to be difficult.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers find the perfect piece of jewelry and to see there please with how I conduct business.
bad,Waiting for customers to come. While waiting we stocked shelves.
bad,"very fast pace phones ringing every minute, walk in trade and appointments kept all techs busy all day. I was able to refine my recruiting skills and management techniques over 12 years. The culture developed was one of superior customer service, honesty and a teamwork. Always helping each other."
bad,"The job was okay keeping up with position that closing and opening different positions. Management were great, enjoy working with fun activities like games. Company was great until corporate did changes."
bad,Sears is a fun place to work. The managment in sears is amazing. The only thing is you never know how long the company will stay in buisness so i am looking.
bad,"Great work life balance and flexible scheduled. Manager very understanding and accommodating. However, given Sears current financial situation the atmosphere is tough and associates are overworked."
bad,This was my second job as a high school student. The hardest part of the job is trying to get customers to sign up for credit cards when the manager hassle you about it everyday.
bad,I worked for Sears for 33 years as lead tech. When the CEO sold the property we were out of a job with 8 weeks of serverence pay.The store was numder one in in the distric. the Manager was young but great to work with.
bad,The workers were very nice and helpful. sears provided training and opportunity to advance and even health care and 401k which i thought was nice. however management was awful and the company focuses too much on production rather then quality and employees.
bad,"For the first two weeks, i was getting lots of hours and I loved that. But after that, i only get 5 hours a week. I talked to my manager 3 different times but the only thing she says is that's all she can give. But she and one of our team member who is her personal close friend would always be working together, and anything her friend says about the schedule, the manager approves which is unfair. And I see that they're still hiring when all they can give us, 2 new associates in her team, is either 4 or 5 hours.  Although, I love my job, the hours go by really fast."
bad,"At first, I was told I could make roughly $8-$9 an hour with compensation of each credit card I get someone to apply for. It didn't matter if they got approved or not. This made me think I could get decent money from the job. At first, I was getting a good amount of people to apply, then people started rejecting more as most people who even shop at Sears anymore are either loyal customers or Canadians, in that case, neither can apply because the loyal customers already have applied or have both cards and Canadians don't have the same zip code as us, so they can't apply. Slowly, but surely, the managers CONTINUOUSLY hassled me ""you need to get more credit apps!"" but I tried as hard as I could to get them, and it wasn't working. The pressure was immense for credit apps and over time, you learn that the job isn't a cashier job, but mostly promotional sales. The coworkers are great and I loved them all. The managers were great and loved them as well, but the managers' manager always got on their cases and kept pressuring them to make us give out more credit apps. Now, we all know Sears is going out of business, but with how hard they pressure the credit apps, they are seriously about to go out of business. If you really need a job, I guess it's not the worse one out there, but be expected to be constantly pressured to make people apply for those credit cards."
bad,"Work place is good."
bad,"very positive workplace great trainees and good benefits .very helpful when it comes to family and personal wants.Deliver outstanding service, exceed expectations and build long-term loyalty"
bad,"My typical day at work includes, calling customers to resolve complaints, problem solving, researching, processing product replacements by matching feature to feature, scheduling service, documenting in a case management system, offering and processing concessions, interpreting policies, offering buyouts during particular circumstances, follow-up phone calls, escalations. "
bad,"A typical day of work at Sears requires coming in and greeting every customer. Each associate has a sales quota to reach, as well as a sales goal for each department. To reach this goal, each associate must use different tactics and closing skills which are taught by the management/senior sales experts. The management at Sears is usually on task. At the store I was in, the management was all new and getting used to the high demands of the area. The co-workers were driven and knowledgeable. In an environment where sales metrics are measured, most associates and experts will work to keep their job. The hardest part of the job was the struggle to get members in to shop. The most enjoyable part was being around the co-workers and learning something new everyday."
bad,"- Contacting Sears customers across Canada and sell protection plans on the devices."
bad,"customer service, love interacting with customers, cashier"
bad,Have to have a second job working here. 15 minute breaks if u work less than6 hours. Management lack comunication
bad,work are very repetitive. They don't have a good management because they compete each.
bad,Atmosphere was enjoyable ... 
bad,"Commission based in appliances was very cut throat, I was swimming in shark infested waters with 2, 30 yr veterans. The pay was great because I earned it, couldn’t speak to a customer that someone else had already spoke to. It was crazy"
bad,I started working for Sears as soon as I graduated from high school and I'd probably still work there if they paid more and had better benefits. Along with the pay being a little in the low side they don't hire anyone full-time.
bad,it was very interesting working at the sears. the most interesting part was processing the credit card it was challenging interesting.got good feedback  from customers
bad,"Working for sears is a great exp.To be able to meet different customers on a daily base was the best part of the job. Also, working as my own boss was a good situation as well."
bad,"Sears is a great company with high expectations. Some of them are hard to attain, but the right kills will keep you going. Most days just involve doing my best to handle concerns that aren't really store level concerns. The hardest part of the job is providing a positive attitude hen customers are just plain rude."
bad,Very bad management they keep complaining about how there losing money and yet there scheduling multiple people for a department in the same day and then the next there's barely anyone its a easy fix that would make them profit.
bad,my typical day at work is very productive and very fast paste. I learned how to run cash registers also how to count down the draw at night.I have also learned how to handle customers problems all at one time with a positive attuitude. The was no hard part of my job. I loved the crew of associates I worked with.
bad,"Employee morale is low, and the store sales are declining at a medium pace.  Mangers who had a lifetime experience were fired and some employees did not report in time."
bad,C est toujours dur de lever des affaire lourdes comme les électro menager
bad,"The managers are awesome there but there is a very high turnover rate and very poor communications. The pay is minimum wage and the raise is not all that good. It is a very good place to learn sales techniques and strategies. This is not a place that employees would enjoy coming into work every day. Customers complain about the littlest things and most of the time, there's nothing that we can do about it. Managers are really good at not hounding over you every single minute of the day. They know that you need your space to sell for the store."
bad,"I enjoyed working here and it was a safe, fun work environment. I typically do basic routine work on a daily basis. I enjoyed working  at a fast past and working with others."
bad,"Sears was a great work experience. Everyone always wore a smile. I LOVED going to work in a peaceful, happy environment."
bad,it is an ok place to work i do not like the trip to get there and the freeway is always packed othwer then that not on good bus routes
bad,count registers greet customers straighten shelves of merchandise. most mangers were friendly and also most of my co workers. hardest part of the job is keeping busy. the most enjoyable part was always making the customers happy.
good,Worked there till the store ws demolished. Lower manaement were freeloaders and were hateful and abusive. donald was a great manager he accomodated me
good,I will never work for this company ever again they have poor management a negative work place very insensitive shows favoritism I wouldn't tell anyone to work for this company
good,"Sears is going through a rough patch, even though they still have the components needed to survive and rebrand themselves. A lot of the issues stem from executive management and your store local management teams. Do not let the average consultative sales numbers fool you. Most successful consultants make high salaries depending on their cities they serve. Home appliance sales commission is normally 1% on the sale and 9% on the margin."
good,"Although the company wasn't great, I met some of the best people.  My comrads were the reason I enjoyed working for the company.  I also, greatfull that the company recogidas my potencial."
good,If you are the type of person that gets mad for people taking there frustrations out on you this is not the job for you. If you take pride in solving people issues then u will do great.
good,I loved and enjoyed the people but I worked in two different stores and both closed. I was a part of both closings and worked 40 plus hours a week and was required by a liquidator to work Overtime.
good,"It is a very strict work environment that doesn't pay you the correct amount for your work. It's a brown nosing job in order to advance. You'll barely see your management but rely on your working/talking employees. Management isn't the best and neither are the employees. I learned to continue filling out applications even if you have a job, dont stop here."
good,not enough hours bad management also co workers dysfunctional. also bad treatment to employees. no options to grow in company
good,"It was a great opportunity at the time but the pay is horrible and you never get raises i worked there for over a year and never recieved any raise or even talk about a raise, the hours are long the pay is horrible, but some of the people there were great. most management didnt know how to do their job. overall it would be a good first job or a high school student who doesnt have bills. Wouldnt count on a career with them though."
good,The typical day here consists of unappreciative management who dont care about your personal life when conflicts arise. the Co workers are amazing. the hardest part of the job is pushing people to open a credit card and knowing that it will get them in financial trouble. the most enjoyable part from being employed there was going home at the end of the night.
good,technicians are the backbone of the company with very little to no support on a daily basis. management and leadership are non present on a daily basis and talent management is non existent.
good,"For employees who have been there over 5 years, they do not get a raise on pay even when requested. The management is very terrible and they seem to not really care about employees."
good,Large amount of over turn of employees due to wage. You will have to do the work of 2 people daily do to overturn. Management is over worked due to staffing issues. district managers in fantasy land do to store staffing issues nation wide to many region and district managers and corporate associates that do not work in the stores   not enough in store help.
good,"Under paid, Over worked. Hardly see management. Pay is at 8.50 an hour. At this point and the previous 3 years, there is a wage hold (no wage increases)."
good,"I liked the employees, but management and the higher ups are very distant from reality, and the expectations are not realistic."
good,"Stock shelves"
good,"Interact with customers face to face on a daily basis, provide sales assistance, as well as design assistance, product selection and use."
good,This job experience was not the best. Overall i felt overworked and underpaid. Management rarely showed their gratitude for your efforts and hardwork. Most manangement was lazy and expected you to do some of their work for them. Most of my co=workers were great. The job requirements themselves is not what i disliked. it was the management and the pay.
good,"Good customer service, good co-workers but it was a sales marketing position."
good,"Consultive Sales Expert in Sears Home Improvement covering hardware, lawn and garden, sporting goods, treadmills, elliptical, recumbent bikes, stationary bikes, automotive tools, electrical tools, carpenter tools, plumber tools, outdoor furniture, grills, lawn hand tools, Christmas and holiday products and display, Web ordering, repair consultant and more. But with all this knowledge an all the above the job still depends on customers which are dwindling. There is no provision for advancement no matter how many years you are employed. My manager does make me the one in charge when he is away, I then either open the store and my departments by myself opening three registers and pulling out all grills to the mall. And also closing will have me count the money in every register and balance, and pull in all the grills from the mall. This can be time consuming so with no customers I also make 6 dollars and hour. Then with customers it depends on the items sold to them that make me also gain monetary value in commission sales."
good,lso how to work well with others and deal with different personalities
good,I was hired in to do a managment job and was never given the pay.
good,"I worked for this company for 10 years and I had many titles while I was there. I started processing claims, then I went to processing invoices. Then when they merged with Kmart, I went to process the whole Kmart database of invoices & purchase orders all by myself on a daily basis."
good,"I took care of my department and customers. I managed the small appliances and set sales, did resets and kept everything in order. management stayed in the office with the air on. Co-workers were ok, The hardest part of the job was just being there. The most enjoyable was helping customers."
good,My experiance was an ok experiance ive learned how to navigate on a computer effectively. I've learned patience and enjoyed giving customer great satisfication and enjoyed helping customers. I enjoyed working with diverse individual from different ethnics. I've learned how to work many different sites on internet explores. Sears coach for excutions to help associates to develop skills nessacery for the job and can be used to go to your next job opportunity. At this point in my life I want to focus on building my career and unfortuately I want a new change.
good,"The place was severely understaffed. Management did not care too much. Coworkers were totally unsupervised and did little to keep their jobs. Sears Decline is not just financially, but is also horribly managed from the top down."
good,Was a good company to work for till new owner took over he killed the companyby selling off the good asets like the credit division then the giant warehouse in vaughan
good,Sears was my first job.  I started working young. The hours weren’t flexible .and the company was closing soon. It was time to find a new job due to going out of business.
good,"I was hired to work in the fine jewelry department. I learned about processing repairs, security, and department planning. I enjoyed learning about metal and stone processes."
good,Very tough and hard work but that was not a problem because I was an experience CDL class B driver that was ready for the task ahead bringing my excellent customer service.
good,"It's been a really long time since I worked there so I don't think I can accurately review it, it was really good when I started then they started changing the commission structure and the home appliances team was really divided"
good,Loved the job just putting. 15 hours a day Is not what you expect when your only getting day pay. When the math is done your only making 7.35 an hour less than minimal wage
good,"If the managers were more personable, and friendly, Sears wouldn't have been too bad of a place to work. The saving grace? Great co-workers who were fun to work with."
good,No many sales floor employees so they use everyone they have and it can sometimes be too much for those workers. The store closes at 9 but we are required to stay until they entire store is clean.
good,"Sold appliances from refrigeration to tools bonus checks if you sell a good amount of protection agreements every month. Buffed floors, unloaded trucks of appliances"
good,"Most of the staff was friendly "
good,A big responsibility to work two major departments and always a shortage of employees. Often time very difficult to complete task when running two department by myself
good,"en realidad es buen trabajo aunque no tienes mucha opcion de crecimiento debido a que la empresa prefiere acender gente de otras sucursales, no tienen trato para con sus empleados"
good,"Sears Canada was a great place to start a career, to learn fundamentals of retailing, merchandising and operations.  There were some great talented people that I had the opportunity to work with."
good,"I have worked for Sears for many years and it used to be fun and they would be family orientated, but then as they were closing more and more stores,It became dead and stressful. They switched from caring about the customer to collecting data on the customers.  We started just getting customers that came in asking when we were going to close because it was always on the news. Most customers have stopped coming in for the most part because they think we have already closed or are going to soon so they want to get it from a place that isn't closing soon for their appliances. It is hard to stand behind a company when it selling off everything because they know it is a sinking ship."
good,"its a meh job it would be so bad if we didnt have to wait hours for parts to come in from other stores and we can never get our work done besides the point everything is old out dated and in other terms ""half assed"""
good,No room for advancement and benefits are mediocre. I have been working here for about two years and they do not give raises but they tell you they will.
good,"Your job as a Cashier is to promote the sears credit card and be pushy and assertive to customers to get them to sign up for the credit card. Many customers openly complained about the professionalism and uncomfortable feeling they get when a cashier is pushing them to get a credit card, but your job as a cashier is based on how many you get a day."
good,Sears was a place like any other retailers with sales incentives and bargains that needed to be addressed for losses and frauds as per my department.The objective was to drive shrink based programs to avoid losses.
good,Enjoyed the work. It was a great  feeling helping people  find the best  product for  their  needs. The lack of Customers over the years I worked made it almost lmpossible to meet any sales goals
good,The training provided was inadequate for job requirements. There was no hands on training on how to use the cash terminals.  All the training I got was from viewing modules on a computer terminal.
good,In my opinion just the area that I work in I am entitled to basically do all jobs except run cash registers and management although we are technically management of each other in the back room even though we have our operations manager who is our manager and our backroom lead.
good,"Hard work, small pay and no advancement toward performance Very poor management and a lack of trust. A lot of harassment with no appreciation for work being done."
good,"sears is a good place to work for but if we take a look at the salary then it is minimum, even with the experience we don't get a raise. And sometimes what i think that there is nothing which we can learn new or exciting."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in through security with your badge and set at your desk and boot up your pc and wait for the phones to ring so you could take care of the customers calling in about repairs.  The hardest part of the job was having to listen to folks scream at you and curse you about their repair estimates. The most enjoyable part of the job was being appreciated by your customers.
good,Overall was a learning experience and wouldn't suggest going there for employment if you don't become one of managements favorites.
good,Its a good job for people that are either still in school or have retired and just want some extra money. Not a job that I would consider for a future.
good,"worked hard for little pay, knowing that if you did more you would not be compensated for it. Not people friendly, job was to get guys to works for sears but never really hired any one just got them on the books for future hiring,"
good,"They have bad management that treats its employees like garbage and does not have consideration for circumstances. They will call you last minute to work shifts that you cannot, take away hours based on credit applicators acquired during the previous work week."
good,The hours of operation were always changing which made this management position difficult.  The employee turn over was high because of the always changing hours of operation.
good,If you have bills to pay its a job and it will at least do that. Not a good career option there are much better options out there and bigger name brands to work for. Just keep looking. Reach for the stars little wonderer I believe in you.
good,Working in a retail store is always a challenge dealing with the public but overall it was nice. As far as co-workers they were friendly. Just not enough hours and no benefit.
good,"customer service, cashiering, pricing, signing, straightening.  company directives rarely seemed well thought out.  Upper managment needs to pull their collective heads out of you no where and get back to reality!"
good,"Sears is a great starter job for high school students,minors, and elderly. Easy-going work environment and quiet.You will catch on very fast if you like routine type job. It's all about teamwork and hard work for members (customers). The compensation is at a start of 8.50. There really isn't raises or benefits if your hourly. Except you can look into Dental or Medical may be possible. Otherwise, the most enjoyable part of the job is providing great customer service and people you work with."
good,I'm a social and outgoing individual and enjoy being active and know when I'm needed.
good,"-Responsible for proper signage for any on sale merchandise"
good,I loved this job. Best first job for a tired college student. Needed to be more physically fit to be balanced on ladders. Needed more training to satisfy customer needs.
good,I really didn't like working at Sears the management and working environment was terrible.
good,"Not enough pay or room for advancement, Worked in th shoe department and got hardly ant feeback"
good,I enjoy working at Sears because of the people in my department...the work is ok...but becomes mundane.
good,"Very tough, No job security, Can make money but they take back even more, LONG HOURS 60-70 a week and no base salary"
good,"This job was ok. The didn't offer health insurance for part-time employees. It was a mindless job, however they did allow certain people to work on entering computer orders giving them a break from taking inbound calls."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and finding one of my managers and ask them what they want me to work on today. I would start on working on whatever the project is that day. ( such as reorganizing the isles, putting displays together, and putting pricing and labeling on everything) after i finish doing that it is usually time for me to take my lunch. when I return from that i usually walk around to assist any customers that look like they might be having a hard time finding what they are looking for or if they have any questions on something they are interested in buying. I usually walk around checking stock making sure everything is pulled forward and everything is neat. Than i say goodbye and head home."
good,This company lacks growth for associate within. The company lacks structure. The benefits are expensive. Not only that they are still closing locations.
good,being hired for this job didnt have any benefits because iy only lasted through christmas then you were let go very unpredictable and no job security
good,Long hours
good,"Sears takes its time training their employees. I was hired to be a technician but felt like a salesperson. Sears didnt care about repairs they just cared about selling products and service agreements.If your numbers were not to their standards(the better you did the higher their standards) they would threaten your job, give you a low raise or lay you off without warning around pay raise time and then hire you again a month later."
good,They expect you to do more than what youre supposed for the pay you get.. They have me working 3 diffferent position and I basicly had to teach myself 2 of the jobs. They dont set reasonable goals for credit cards when they know they dont get a lot of business. The management are very dishonest and unorganized.
good,It's like any other retail job. I mostly enjoyed the customer enteractions. Some of the management and co-workers are good workers then you get the ones that aren't. I usually work every department and run the floor as a footwear lead. I do all the stuff that a assistant manager does.
good,"It was an okay place to work. I got to meet a lot of nice people and sold lots of jewelry. There was extensive training programs that had to be done every month which I thought was good to keep everyone on their toes. My immediate manager was awesome but, the store and corporation is just too harsh and uncaring."
good,didn't spend a lot of time here. didn't love it but didn't hate it.
good,"As a backroom associate we were the lowest paid and hardest working members of the team. It was obvious that the store was not going to last much longer, it finally closed a year after I left."
good,"I learned a lot working for Sears, including how to manage the difficult times and situations.  The friends I made working there are important to me today.  Sears believed in me and helped me to grow as a manager and leader, and develop myself into what I am today."
good,"Place is closed, poor direction and management. People and team were great.  Would not recommend to a friend. Company expects 100% and does not even offer par raise over 3 years"
good,"I feel that they can be a bit harsh. They literally fired me on Dec. 23, after returning from an illness. I even provided a doctor note."
good,"No hay mucho de que hablar, la empresa tiene ventajas y desventajas"
good,"Está bien el ambiente al principio pero después es estresante, el salario es muy bajo y es mucho trabajo, además no conviene porque no puedes descansar en fin de semana ningún día, solo entre semana el día que te indiquen ahí."
good,"Management sucked management sucked , team was really good and sales was good just the toxic management is what really sucked at sears but over all it was a great job"
good,"Aside from the department manager the majority off my coworkers were fine to work with. The department, appliances, manager employed the seagull management style, where you hover over the employees, desecrate on them and expect them to sell more so that your bonus would be larger.. He never offered and encouraging word, just demanded more sales, even though I sold $41k worth of product and in my second month on the job."
good,"In my experience with Sears, you have to be resilient person to handle the eight hours.  You have to be an upbeat person, that does not take anything personal.  I am that type of person, that's why I am still here."
good,"Management is inconsistent. Very stressful working here. One manager will tell you one thing, and then another will tell you to do something else. They want you to leave before what the schedule shows, but wants you to still complete everything they told you to do."
good,"What I enjoyed about Sears was meeting people, co-workers and customers alike. I also liked that there were always projects and busy work to do, so there was never a dull moment."
good,"Management was rarely available."
good,the manager will tell you that youre late even if youre on time he will kick you out of your break even if youre eating he will hunt for you you will have to quit and they will make sure you never get a recommendation or a job ever again. mandatory group meeting
good,"I worked varied duties, was always busy, enjoyed working with the management and co-workers.  I was an independent worker, using my time and judgement to get the job done in an efficient, timely and productive manner."
good,Managment likes to take advantage of employees. Management on salary so would work around 30 hours a work and leave rest of work for the person making 7 dollars and hour even their work responsibilities.
good,"Working at Sears was great when I first started and I did learn a lot while there. I think Sears was a great company that is struggling to stay afloat. I felt like I was rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic! "
good,"In the apparal department i was able to stay current with fashion standards, organizing freight and helping anyone who needed assistance with finding the right outfit for the occasion.  With my honesty I was able to provide great feedback to develop healthy clientelle however the lack of support from managment proved that the efforts werent applied in the best places which led to a discovery of internal theft and a shut down of the store."
good,"unlike the other beauty advisers, i was fragrance, so i did not qualify for schooling or a uniform but was still expected to know products from all makeup brands. When asked about how to educate myself, the assistant store manager suggested asking the other beauty advisers. this didn't really help. There also seemed to be a concerning amount of favoritism between management and the other employees. Managers from other departments were more understanding to certain situations than the cosmetic department manager. Over all, it was a tolerable place to work."
good,"I joined Sears, for its longevity as a company. The position of Appointment Setter was very flexible for meet the schedule I needed at the time. I appreciate the opportunity, yet I had to move on"
good,"While Sears does provide quite a few learning experiences the entire company seems stuck in the past at what they once were, not what they are now.  There is rarely ever any advancement opportunities unless you are at a ""nice"" store, rarely if ever are profits spent on improving stores and store infrastructure, departments are being dissolved left and right, client complaints are rarely addressed by upper management or when they are they don't care. Not to mention all the warranty pushing and metrics; if they could make a metric for breathing they would."
good,"For what your asked to do the pay just isn't there. between the 100+ days in the trailers just melting loading them, or the 0 degrees in the winter and the heat just didn't do much to the trailers or really even the building because the doors were always open."
good,"Horrible Management. Understaffed. Just like any other retail stores but this place does not have any benefits for a part timer. Also, 1 person handles the entire department by his or herself and 1 person or 2 person closes the entire store. Not efficient."
good,i got payed a low plus commission. people buy online and pick up at store so i would get little commission and was really a stock boy at this point. i needed to get a better job was not making what i was making when first started.
good,"A good first job but the demands are too high in some aspects. Some practices on a systemic level and some individual are obsolete, to say the least. You will have to deal with customers that are rude and have no rights or personal pride."
good,a typical day at work for me was showing up at 10 A.M. I Did everything. I would answer phone calls along with scheduling  service appointments on appliances. I learned how to run a Point Of Sale system and engage with customers. Later on I would unload a freight truck that would have customer's orders and replenishment for the store.
good,a work day should be enjoyable and not stressful. You should be able to look forward to going to work and not get anxious thinking about it. I learned money management and the hardest part of my job was my bosses they weren't very helpful or friendly.
good,fast paced and demanding place to work.  However I found value providing outstanding customer service to our employees and customers. I would recommended working for Sears if you like a fast paced environment.
good,"I haven't worked for this company in years.  When I was there in the late 90s, I could not think of a better company to work for!  Culture, Family, Great Leadership."
good,I only worked part time so some of the above questions I have no information on and gave it one star.  I had a very good manager who recognized my skills and ask if I was willing to stay on. I would love to but not working in the women's apparel department.This was a seasonal job and working in the women's apparel department was challenging. Keeping the ladies room clean was the worst.
good,Not a stable job environment. Unstable CEO making horrible business decisions. Need to understand the retail community better and the advancement towards it.
good,"I enjoyed working for sears. I was please with administrative employees. Training is excellent. however, the pay never goes up and not easy for growth. Lacks employee insentive."
good,"Employees are not treated fairly, do not receive enough hours. Hours are dependent on how many customers you get to open a Sears credit card. If you do not get enough, you will not get work."
good,This is a decent place to work for a first time job.  Decent hours and you stay active running around the store. It can be hard work but it's good work and better than fast food.
good,"A typical day at work was like most other retail positions.  Interact with customers, help them decide what they want and find it, check out.  Schedules varied week to week and end of month meant lower hours.  Management didn't try very hard to enforce rules so many employees took advantage of what they could get away with."
good,"A lot of work with little benefit, not a lot of room for advancement, stressful environment, a lot of turnover. "
good,This is the second place I had worked for Sears. They will do anything to get people in trouble just to get rid of them. You have managers sleeping with their employees with no repercussions. My direct manager could care less about you and quickly throw you under the bus if it would benefit him. I've seen how people were treated by management and how they treated each other. Never again will I work for this company. I don't recommend anyone even applying. You will either get fired quick or be miserable while there.
good,"I worked in the cash office, and the job itself wasn't bad. I actually liked it. What I hated was management. When you do your job in the office, you have to have management come in to count, and they left you waiting for a good half hour, not because they were doing something, but because they were sitting around talking. They alsp don't care about your schedule. For the first 3 months of being hired, I was never in the cash office. After that, I was still constantly scheduled other places in the store instead of what I was hired for, regardless of how many times I would talk to them about it. The management also would sit around and complain about their employees where they could hear them. If the management wasn't so horrible, I would honestly still probably be working there."
good,The job as MCA is code for putting up after others customers cashiers and management. Management was no where to be   found especially if a MSU game was on
good,Assisting Sears customers was the best. The time went by fast because of the constant incoming calls. Management was ok but my co-workers were the best and helpful.
good,My co-workers at sears are great. The mangement is good at most times but at other times it is bad. The hours were decent but now they are unacceptable.
good,"No placement opportunities, minimum wage offered, no advancement opportunities, no flexible work hours, lack of communication amongst managers to employees"
good,i was a merchandiser and it was always something to do my job was to basically fold the clothes people messed up check the floor and dressing room for sensor tags make sure nobody was stealing but i was there just for the holidays
good,"buenas oportunidades de crecimiento, fallos en personal lo que no esta bien esque ponen poco personal en departamentos donde se necesita mas ayuda lo que mas me gusto fue los eventos que organizaban"
good,"Typical day at work requires ringing people out and trying to stay busy, management is not that great if you work in LE coworkers are awesome."
good,It pays the bills. If you get your paycheck and they didn't mess it up. It simply seems as though this company is failing and has no idea how to stop its downward momentum. Everything I have seen them do to change things has struck as being the most backwards solutions ever. I do not have a MBA. So perhaps my opinion is moot. But it pays the bills. If your willing to deal with the enormous headache. They will work you to death and do everything they can to not pay you for it.
good,"For a company this big you would think the benefits would be better but that's not the case.  They do offer insurance but pay a very very small amount.  Also, If you work out in the warehouse you better be able to work fast because you are all ways timed and if you fall below the standard you will be wrote up till you are let go.  They say that has only happened a few times but there are so many other ways they can get you.  If you are a fast pace person that doesn't not mind taking chances you will be OK."
good,"Never a dull moment and always on the go.  "
good,"A typical work day included me turning on and polishing all the televisions, insuring the inventory was accurate, counting the register, securing all locks in the department, tending to members and answering the phones, completing online orders, and checking the departments metrics. My co-workers were great people, but the management could have been better. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning about electronics. Because the company lacked adequate advertisement, the hardest part was meeting the metric standards regarding sales."
good,"A typical day at work is researching refund gift cards customers did not receive and issuing replacements, if needed. Answering phone calls, and placing orders for corporate customers."
good,"I only got the job because the store manager wanted to sleep with me. When he figured out that I wasn't going to put out, he only gave me 5 hours a pay period (two weeks)."
good,Students can get a job here easily so your job is not valued. there are incentives to do a good job but the incentives are unrealistic.
good,Good job for anyone who likes to get paid standing around. I learned how to have patience with people and not get upset when a customer is upset
good,"In home sales of HVAC equipment . "
good,It was a comfortable surrounding but the managers didn't like me to well. My age was the only reason that the managers despised me.
good,Very fast paced. Meet a wide variety of people on a daily basis. Best part of the job is working with some of the customers.
good,"•	Plan, describe, arrange, and sell itinerary tour packages and promotional travel incentives offered by various travel carriers."
good,"I resolved any chargebacks and dispute a customer may have. by sending POD( Proof of Deliveries), correct pricing, give detail invoices. provide  merchandise prices. compose emails with account managers"
good,"The number of hours worked and the pay was not sufficient. Management at time where very rude to employees. Non management co workers where great. Hardest part of job would be having to ""sale"" store credit cards or risk the possibility of being fired."
good,It can be a great experience but no work place is perfect. It may not have been a perfect fit for me but it might be for someone else depending on the person. I learned a lot there and it is an eye opener to some things.
good,"I don't mean to be a harsh critic but, Sears just didn't have what I was looking for but then again it was my first job right out of high school. Advancement was a joke, Management was worse and there were no benefits for part-time employees at all."
good,"It was one of my best retail jobs, because you actually had help from your team and sometimes managers, no one was screaming at you and breathing your neck, of course you have that one person but seeing them once or twice a day was fine. You truly had teamwork."
good,Management is all trash CEO cut back on employees and no one to help customers too much pressure on employees to get credit company pays attention to nothing customers care about that why they are failing!
good,"What was once a great American company is a shell of its former self.  It is going down fast.  Not much positive left.  Hasn't been able to adapt to today's modern market,"
good,"Personally, I found the management knowledgeable and the overall teammates at the location where I worked very sketchy"
good,"A typical day consists of doing the same routine every day with the same unmotivated co-workers. I work a more physical job, which can be very difficult when the temperature inside is the same as outside. I have learned that if you're not going to do something all the way, then don't do it at all. Also, be careful who you help get a job."
good,"in merchandise pricing you work the floor. You return items, sort out merchandise, place the merchandise out on the floor and occasionally run register. There is no benefits and it is a minimum wage job. You don't get paid what you deserve for the amount of work you put in."
good,"while this place has everything without leaving the building (drycleaners, restaurants, pharmacy, shopping store, car repair) they are too big of a company to care for little person, they are just looking at the bottom line. I was hired as a contractor to hire, but they were never looking to hire, they extended my contract multiple times, without a chance to renegotiate salary, or benefits. they were very far commute and the salary barely paid for gas..."
good,"It was blah. No room for moving up at the store, was relocated within first week to somewhere further away, made no more money, worked less time. Not worth it."
good,"I worked in a great area of town , but to often we never had to product. we never had any item to out up for customer and horribly management."
good,"During my employment with Sears Ro. I experienced numerous acts of harassment and unfair wages. This company is strong  and respectable, but has a broken and poor infrastructure. As  whole the company is fair but when broken down to individual stores/locations/departments they lack a basic human element of professionalism and understanding. Myself and many other employees at my store location had to meet with upper management through months of wage/hour garnishments to correct the situation. thus including but not limited to: breach of contract, unclear understanding of job titles/responsibility's, personal vendettas and non-compensation for work done. I would highly recommend avoiding any career options with this company."
good,"•	Responsible for performing warehouse shipping and receiving duties"
good,A typical day working at sears was standing at a register to ring up items for customers and assisting them with their needs. Also returning items that they had purchased and did not want or need anymore. I dont recall learning anything to use in my daily life or anything about management as it was many years ago that i've worked there.
good,"Very disorganized, poor training and long hours.  Compensation is not nearly enough for the amount of time you work.  Work to LIVE not Live to WORK.  I did enjoy  my co workers and customers, and truly believe in customer service"
good,The co-workers are great and they assist each other as needed. Also delivering a great shopping experience to all customers.
good,"same as above"
good,Worked there for a year and recently let go. Gained retail experience
good,Working at Sears has taught me great customer skills. My co workers are extremely friendly and makes work very enjoyable.
good,days at work are unexpected with being understaffed and always under new management its a revolving door you must be able to deal with lack of resources and hands on deck
good,"Helping customers select their major appliances.  I have learned that you will deal with all types of people.  The hardest part of the job is when a customer has a problem and you do everything you can for them and then they turn around and cancel their order anyway. Upper management is not always their for the workers, but the coworkers are great."
good,The flexibility for hours was great. The co-workers not trust worthy. Management not the greatest.
good,"Sears"
good,No raises or advancement.  A lot of favoritism. Company don't care about the workers only about them making money. Never work comission for Sears.
good,"Poor leadership, company has franchised the stores and lost control of the business."
good,Decent job that taught me how to be more organized and time managed. Taught me about communication with co-workers.
good,"At my Sears Auto Center the managers have the tendency to change schedule on the fly and never inform the employees of the change until the last moment. The other thing is that the managers only care to cover themselves when they have to. I have been here for a almost two years and the thing is I am paid very low for my job as an automotive technician and treated as a servant and not as an employee. Other things like the managers will take a one hour to two hour lunch break but when we take lunch they yell at us for taking thirty-five minutes, instead of thirty. I have never been treated as low as dirt as I have been here at Sears."
good,"diagnosed & repaired washers/dryers, accepted payments, ordered parts"
good,I guess it was okay when I was there.  That is about all I can say.
good,"sold products and services for sears seemed to go good at first then went down hill. no benefits no hours to work to make a living"
good,This company will start you at part-time and minimum wage. If you have previous experience they might compensate you well. All stores are poorly ran. Very few fair managers to work for. Company stock has been terrible since 2007.
good,You will not receive a raise unless you are offerred an advancement. The best part to work in is commission.
good,"I learned how to work the cash register, my co workers was lazy, management was lazy and unorganize,"
good,"A typical day at work is not productive when there isn't any customers to keep the laughter and day going by. I've learned that in order to get to the top, you have to start from the bottom and work your way up. The management is very intuitive with what is going on. A few of my co-workers are a joy to work with. The most enjoyable part of this job is finding things to do around the store to make the time fly by."
good,"The hardest part of working for sears portrait studio was achieving the sales from the previous year. Everyday, there was a goal that had to be met. Some days the goal was so high that we didnt make last years numbers. Customers have a limit as to how much they want to spend so meeting our goals for the day made it just a bit harder to achieve."
good,"Really hard to have a life outside of work always tired because are never guaranteed a day off!"
good,"Would assist customer with various types of electronic needs, ranging from mp3 players, dvd/ blueray, television, and surround sound systems. Would manage cash register. Open up credit account for customers. Attend trainings for new and updated electronic equipment. Would meet sales goal assigned. "
good,The job is not easy. I learned a lot of customer service skills there. For the most part its a decent job better to have another job on the side because they cut hours at will. 
good,A typical day at work can be having a normal crowd of customers with not enough staff to help out at checkout and help maintain the floor. I've learned that you have to be strong on whatever the job ask and what the managers expect from you. The hardest part of the job is when coworkers are not doing there job which requires you to work much harder which is not a problem for me since I like to take on challenges but when your working in a team that one coworker might take all the credit even though they did nothing in that project. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy.
good,"As a cashier you have goals that require you do get credit applications, and shop your way rewards enrollments. Management pushes you to do your best and want you to hit your numbers.All they care about is numbers nothing else. Co-workers help you as well. The hardest part of this job is that sometimes people like to take your sales as there own and its hard to deal with another coworker that does that. the most enjoyable part about the job is that you get to work with different people and see customers walk out happy."
good,It was a very good company to work for up to three years ago then the economic crash started hitting them and they started cutting everything. You were to get more done with a quarter of the people and still keep customers satisfied and that was not a good environment to be in.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers,removing merchandise from trucks and stoking shelf's."
good,"I would of course deal with customers daily help them with there purchase and assist in any kind of away. The management was poor and if i had a choice i would change it, they were only concerned with there jobs and not the well being of others. I most enjoyed helping customers and welcoming them back to the store."
good,I would work there again if given the opportunity. I love meeting new people
good,"sears overall was a ok job. They were very strict about goals, they cared more about getting customers to sign up for thing other than assisting the customers with there actual needs. hours were not guaranteed at all."
good,goals seem to be to stay open and stay afloat rather then the right thing or whats best for the customer or employee
good,"i learned how to be a good cashier, the company was really good"
good,I have appreciated the opportunity to get back into the work force and Sears gave me that opportunity. However it is time for me to move on. I am wanting to get back into pharmacy. I am desperatly needing someone to give me a chance to get my feet back in the door.
good,"I would do office work, and handle the money in the safe. I would also schedule in home repairs and deliveries for customers. I loved helped the customers whenever I was able to."
good,I would unload trucks when they came in with our shipments and help customers load the merchandise they purchased into their cars.
good,"In my time with Sears (four months)- a part of my job was to make sure that everyone got their breaks and to find out when they were needing them while waiting on customers. I was a back up cashier or a back up person for the cashiers and also for the ones working in Hardware department. I was also to sign people up for Credit Cards and Shop Your Way Rewards program, and also to get the customers to purchase a protection agreement depending on what the item was. The co-workers were always negative and backstabbing each other, they would nit pick about every little thing, they complained about management and put them down, they also would tell customers about what was going on at the store level- for instance there was rumors about the store closing down and so the co-workers who had been there a long time would say either yes or no to the rumors and so on. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for a credit cards and getting people to sign up for the Shop Your Way Rewards program, The most enjoyable part of the job was the helping the customers,"
good,"Sears is a calm, quiet working environment. I learned to work on my own and if there was an issue with equipment or customer i learned to remain calm and see if the problem could be handled before insisting assistance. The hardest part of job was trying to keep the customers to remain calm if we need a price check for a missing tag but with a genuine apology and conversation that can make the difference. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers look for gifts and learning to work independently."
good,Computer systems are too outdated for the requirements customers have for this company.
good,"A typical day at work would be, the second you clock in you find out what station or area you are assigned to, check on all your metrics and sales goals, and get to work. I learned customer service is not for everyone. You might slave all day at work, and the compensation you might recieve is hardly enough. Our management team is some what understanding, on the other-hand it's hard to resolve issues especially when most of the management team is either related or close friends. Co-workers are cool people. You get to meet new people, and share stories and sometimes develope friendships outside of work. The most enjoyable part about this job is our customers! Sometimes they can pick your spirits up when you might be feeling down."
good,Gratefull for almost 20yrs of service. It brought me great personal satisfaction repairing a customer's product. Just one thing to help put customer's life back in place.
good,"On a typical day at work, I loaded and unloaded washers, dryers, and other appliances. Additionally, I tested these appliances before delivery. What I learned most on this job were the mechanics of appliances. Management and co-workers were fairly easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was handling the weight of some of the appliances, like the refrigerators. I enjoyed dealing with customers the most."
good,"company is not ran properly by district manager, thats why 5 repair centers closed in our district.otherwise i learned alot about the corperate america"
good,"I loved working at Sears because my co-workers were always so helpful and nice. However, the store was completely falling apart due to lack of organization which created stress for everyone, providing for a less-than-pleasant employment term."
good,Salarios bajos cero oportunidad de crecer empleados tóxico; personal administrativo sin preparación
good,"I got paid minimum wage ($8.46 an hour) and in Miami that’s only enough for someone with no bills to pay and no rent. They pay you $2 dollars for every credit card you do (excluding the first five cards of each month) and that money only comes in on the last paycheck of the month so the first paycheck was very weak. For having to be standing up for hours and having to tolerate being constantly nagged to make more credit, I never felt like the job was worth it or rewarding in any way."
good,"you are expected to sell Sears credit cards to customer,if you don't sell a certain quota of Credit Cards the company will lay you off. they have closed the store in Redding."
good,"Management swept many terrible or even illegal things under the rug. No back lash on employees who could make their credit quotas. They always did whatever they wanted. Often times I had to stop what I was doing to help other managers and employees because they didn't know how to do something. No one cared about anything. The store manager was terrible and rude and condescending to all her employees. Often times people would get signed up for credit cards they already had or didn't qualify for multiple times a week. And the cashier's got away with it because it made goals for our store.  However, I also did have many other Co workers who I cherished and made getting through the day so much easier."
good,You could show up 2 hours late and the day still felt like a week. Slow customer traffic. I would be working as both a service advisor and technician working on cars multiple days a month.
good,Sears used to be a great place to work  the Internet and top management  killed sears sears became Kmart so sad we used to make money it’s too bad it ended the way it did  cooperate greed
good,Job culture was very oppressing and did not give proper recognition to top performers.  Their coaching practices are very negative and consequently the employee moral is very low
good,"Sears was a good place to work until they started downsizing and then closed the store altogether.  I retired, but I am still trying to get ,y retirement money from the,  Therefore, I would not recommend anyone to work for them."
good,"Supervisores sin capacitación en manejo de personal. Gerente de central chismoso  todo de tu vida personal quiere saber. Se adjutica beneficios de la empresa como propios. Tienes que pagar tu propia fiesta navideña,  te cancelan vacaciones y descansos así estén programados. No hay oportunidad de subir de puesto o sueldo. No hay capacitación pero si eres buso aprendes por tu cuenta para que no te vaya mal. Hostigamiento constante para que saques el trabajo, no te vas a tu hora cambios  de horario de un día para otro no hay horas extras. Según te devuelven tu hora que trabajaste de más pero es muy común que 5minutos antes de que hagas la hora te digan que te vayas para que no te la devuelvan. Con 6 minutos de atraso tienes que devolver  una hora."
good,"To many chiefs not enough indians, "
good,Average. Nothing much to say. Maybe it was just the area but it wasn’t the best job I’ve had yet it wasn’t the worst. No benefits. No raises. Not flexible with the schedule.
good,Other than limited hours per week and dealing with customer service issues this job would satisfy anyone who wants something to do with a chance to make more than minimum wage. Job uncertainty looms as stores close. I believe it is impossible to survive on this income alone as the hours vary from 5 to under 15 per week.
good,"The store was always busy, and there would be a mess if you don't stay on top of it every minute. Sometimes it would be hard to get hold of the manager, or someone to help with the customers."
good,No opportunity for job advancement or salary increase. Was not appreciated for being in the top 5 for the department that I supervised. this included high sales and profit margins. There were almost 800 Sears stores.
good,"Enjoyed working with people at Sears but it was very depressing to see poor performance results in spite of hard work by people. "
good,"I worked in the electronics department my entire employment. My manager when I signed on was a great guy who encouraged efficiency and allowed us to be ourselves to close sales. We were a well-performing team but it wasn't enough for corporate. They let go of our manager and replaced him with a bossy know-it-all who couldn't talk to a person for more than 5 seconds before making them angry. His terrible leadership ruined the job for me. My entire department ended up quitting and they gutted the section soon after. I made great friends, learned customer service skills, and even gained a certification in LG TVs. It started great and went down in a ball of fire."
good,"I like my job at Sears but its not the same as the first 7 years working here it does have alot of changes.Sears now is fighting to survive and  its affecting to all regular associate. I learned alot working here: like how to love your job,teamwork,taking care our costumer,Quality,Accuracy,and most of all safety.The work place culture is good and its all for the good of the company.The hardest part of the job is when your doing extra work that your not getting credit for doing it. And  the most enjoyable part is  if I just do my regular job, finish it then go home."
good,"Only full time positions were for management. Pay is minimum wage but expected Fortune 500 employees. Building was always hot air controlled by corporate some where up north, which made no sense."
good,"Poor decisions, Lack of directions, kept employees in the dark, Over worked and stressed warehouse staff to the point of leaving the job.  lack of support from all sale persons and management.  No compensation to stay during liquidation.  employees worked while hurt, safe was no longer high priority ."
good,I have worked with Sears for 10 years; from 2007-2016 although the staff and the management of the location I was working at were fantastic. The overall management of Sears as a whole was unsuccessful. They have laid off thousands of workers without compensation or severance packages. I find this unfair and unjust.
good,This was my first actual job and it was a good introduction to the work force at the time.  I lucked out and had good managers in my department who worked with me to help me learn.
good,"Fun, Fast paced environment with supportive team members. Great job for kids straight out of high school looking to begin building their resumes. Flexible schedules for college student."
good,"Sears was a retail sales position in outside garden. The management focused only on getting customers to get a sears card, not how well you were selling. no help offered for selling techniques or ideas. they expected new charge card applications. did not care how much sales you did. store is in poor business level and may fold. store manager was terrible and does nothing to help employees raise sales."
good,Hardest part was trying to find the enthusiasm to get things done when everyone else lacked initiative nor motivation of their own.Felt like most of the work fell short on their hand.
good,"The most enjoyable about this job, was seeing all the little kids dressed up to get pictures taken.  Selling picture packages to the parents.  The hardest part of this job was getting off the floor with the babies."
good,"Sears can be a good job to have, IF, you are able to hustle to customers in Appliances. Appliance Sales Associates make more than the managers. However, the commission rates have gone down several times over the last few years and locations keep closing for various reasons. You can make good money and quickly, but there are no benefits that are affordable."
good,Management expects that incoming associates already are familiar with sears protocol. You are expected to perform at exceptional high expectations with little to no guidance.
good,This is a nice place to work but no advancement. Nice work environment but there is everyone set in there positions and you work under them no advancement
good,I just wished I was able too learn more . I'm very competitive and wanted to learn fully before project ended . Management there had there favorites which made it hard to get more assistants when needed. Once again it was a great experience and lots to learn.
good,Poorly run shop with large turnover of employees.Almost zero loyalty to long-time hard working employees. Micro management of minute and insignificant details of customer service.
good,"If you maximize your time here and focus on obtaining skills, this can be a fruitful experience. I firmly believe you can succeed anywhere you might go after this experience."
good,"i was only part time here, worked while i was in high school and going to college. i had fun working with my peers and we made it a fun environment to work"
good,"It was only temporary. I hate it so much. Want to do something better. Some people are excited about working so was I, but after a year it wasn't. Done"
good,you have no work/life balance. Management is very poor. Manager and senior Managers have no knowledge of talking-to the vendors. They curse you with bad words.
good,Softlines like clothes is okay. It's fadt paced though. If they ask you if you want to work in hardlines like lawn and garden or appliances RUN!! The hardlines manager is a terrible manager and an evern worse human being. Does nothing but scream and complain to and about you. MPU and softlines are manageable but theres only 30 minute breaks and you're more than likely gonna be miserable because store closing makes everything difficult. If you manage to survive here i salute you.
good,A typical day was waiting for customers to come to the store. Commission has minimum and fighting for sales was common. The management was sub par and non helpful.
good,working at this department store was a good experience on what managers shouldn't do. they wont work with college students with there school schedule .
good,"* Sign-up customers for various programs offered through the store"
good,Sears is a good place to start your life experience working. It not a place where can truly have a career. There was a constant turnover rate. It is a good place to gain experience in the working world at a young age.  If you are looking for  career this is not the place.
good,"Mangement harsh about rewards program and credit cards but don't always prepare you to sell to the public."
good,"Sears has an excellent training program for sales and Tech specialist, "
good,"I applied for a certain position in clothing and they had me with yard work, etc. I didn't like what I was doing, but I made the most of it, The bosses weren't on the same page sometimes and I was usually confused."
good,"day starts with getting your route on the computer, then going to customers homes and finding out the problem with the machine, running to a local parts place to get parts if available. Maintaining good customer relations, good training on older products with experienced techs, newer products learn as your working on them, hard part of the job is not knowing when you will be home if you have a family so its very hard to plan anything. Great job if you enjoy working alone and mostly being your own boss."
good,"I love putting together projects plans to implement apparel placement & operations in the store environment. My team organized, wrote, and published a monthly document showing stores how to execute the new apparel coming in for women's, mens, kids, accessories & costume jewelry.  We participated in 2 or 3 yearly events to train the store regions and districts for the overall in-store experience.  We developed and worked with the field visual team to implement merchandising strategies/concepts to support the buying teams strategies. "
good,"No raises, only performance based incentives that are purposefully hard to attain in smaller markets. Tons of drive time, forced OT , day never ends on time."
good,"Overall, the job was a lot of hard work. Management was terrible. The store manager was there about 5 hours a week when he was supposed to be there 40+. Terrible place overall to work."
good,"Working with my team at sears is great, however do to recent many set backs with with company, has resulted in many hours being cut for associates in varies departments, making the work load increased tremendously for all the associates. It creates more stress and more work with out proper compensation for the employees. I think it can be a great company to wok for again if they are able to get out of their current slump."
good,"the over all job was okay, I loved working with a few of my co-workers. management was very terrible. they wouldn't take real problems into consideration, and didn't give raises that were promised. I  wouldn't want to work there again"
good,"When I began working at Sears Optical, I enjoyed my job very much and the manager seemed eager to help me achieve my potential, but as the years wore on, I saw that there was no chance for advancement, little to no raise in my hour wage and my manager became someone I did not enjoy working with at all."
good,"Sears canada was the starting point of my sales career - it thought me how a sales environment works, teaching you on how to sell the small things the customer needs"
good,I was a cashier at sears and for the most part it was a very easy job. I will say I did not like how management always pressured you to get credits and people to sign up for shop your way rewards. I look at it as if an individual isn't interested then they should nt be pressured into it.
good,"Enjoy stores and people in the stores. Keeping up with over shorts, safety, monthly deliverables, Merchandise protection standards, external and internal investigations."
good,"I worked helping customers and  setting up displays. Merchandise needed to be replaced, updated and changed around to suit the season.  I learned to be able to know layout of the store in order to assist the customers."
good,There benefits and compensations are very poor for the job. Poor communication between management and staff. Very hard to move up. Sears is not what it used to be and its starting to show.
good,"•	Supervised and corrected the revenue reporting mainframe and UNIX batch, online production processing systems, and incident remediation activities and ushered in a new philosophy that was adopted by Sears to improve 20% in revenue at that particular location."
good,"This job was ok, however the air never worked, sent me to the er for heat exhaustion. Management was very clingy to certain employees. Never had enough employees to cover each departments."
good,"The management is horrible. If you do not get enough people to sign up for credit cards, they threaten to fire you. The other employees were great, but the managers, not so much."
good,"My typical day at Sears, was to come in the morning, prepare my register for the daily sales.  Meet with the management meeting for a daily huddle.  Complete daily transactions with customers.  Management was not the greatest.  Very hard to be promoted within."
good,Not a career job but great for young people starting off. Pay isn't that great. Company does not always recognize potential. Job culture could have been better.
good,Salesmen don't get paid an hourly and they expect you to do the jobs other people do get paid hourly for as well. I'm typing this to fill up the remai
good,"Working at Sears, the work experience is not the best. The company doesn't put forth the effort for the employee nor does the company value the employee."
good,"This company does NOT treat all employees equally.  They do not respect their employees.  They expect the women to do the work of a man but their pay schedule is unreal.  Their so called ""reviews"" are"
good,"I made many great friends at Sears. However, management was terrible, and their was an infinite amount of training. As a salesman, you have to not only sell the product, but sell protection agreements, credit cards, and get people to sign up as a rewards member. Even when you are good at these things, management was always on your case. If you are very good, there is a good profit potential. You receive money for credit cards you have people apply for, as well as protection agreements, products you sell, and bonus opportunities."
good,"-Typically my day involved opening a cash register and looking amazing. i sold vacuums the most as more vacuum customers were present than mattress customers. when you sell a mattress you go through a long process and sometimes complicated to handle operating system to order in the mattress and schedule a delivery."
good,the store manager is not a people person and is very unappreciative.we work to hard for very little pay and haven't gotten a raise in 5 years.
good,"management puts down their employees too much instead of building them up and the pay could be better. cowokers are nice people and most customers are nice as well, they could also update they're systems which run slow and are from the 80s"
good,"not a lot of room for advancement, co workers amazing, management was okay but not really helpful. the company in as CEO seems to be helpful. store was damaged roof leaked when it rained, not only on customers but merchandise as well."
good,"I've been here for about two years. What I can definitively say is this, Sears drains your soul. Unless you know for a fact that you 1) love this kind of work, 2) will be here temporarily or 3) have other plans for another job, avoid this place!"
good,"the environment is good. the management is all corporate. corporate allows very little freedom for the store management to do what is needed to stay afloat. corporate office has very little to no contact with management other than emails. the biggest issue, NO RAISES."
good,"Aprendí a darle atención al cliente,cobro de cajas,seguimiento de ventas,"
good,"Sears is a great foot in the door if you want experience with customer service. I have learned a lot of skills in retail and sales that i can take upon me to other jobs. The management was awful, but my coworkers are the reason why i stayed at this company for so long. You make lasting friendships here. The hardest part of my job was when we were low on cashiers and i had to deal with customers left and right while trying to answer phones and solve customer issues while cashing someone out at the register. There was never help when you called for it. My job was sales and i ran on commission and i couldn't make any money being behind the register for over an hour cashing little things out like curtains and clothing. It took away from doing other important duties i had. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a big sales knowing you helped those customers be satisfied with their choice and also being with my coworkers, they made the day go by faster."
good,associates are not always compensated fairly for the amount of work expected of them. In addition the company as a whole does not provide adequate working equipment for employees to complete necessary tasks.
good,A typical day would be stressful because we had deadlines to meet. I Plenty of times we had to send associates home according to the layout / stats.
good,"Not a place I enjoy working at. Constant back stabbing and arguing. No room for advancement, no job security, and no benefits."
good,I learned how to be proactive and be a self starter. It was not ran well at first but when they started make changes with new management the store developed more professionalism.
good,This company doesn't care about anything but getting the job done. you work in thunderstorms and snow. They give the customers to much power over you to insure that you feel like nobodies. 3PD is not your friend they are your slave masters. there is no one in this world who should work 16 hours in a day and get paid 5 dollars an hour and with no overtime pay.  i stayed so long because i felt like i couldn't do  anything better with my life.
good,"Sears is not what it used to be. Their management style is to push their metrics instead of pursuing customer service and satisfaction. Do not know how they stay in business with their ideas. They need to revert back to the way they were, customers would appreciate it and come back to the store."
good,I guess this position would be best suited for someone looking to earn extra money whilst at school. Not someone who is married and trying to save up.
good,I went into this job optimistic but was sorely dissapointed. Management never communicated with each other. I would start a task and then be reprimanded for doing it when another manager told me to do it. There is a reason this company is going bankrupt.
good,"Nobody wants to get yelled at, so when you page for a manager no one really shows up or they all assume someone else is going to get it.  When one person in the backroom gets lazy, it throws everything out of sync."
good,The company is currently going through some financial woes and have been for the past several years; in which case creates a unstable work environment. However Sears is making every effort to  consider the needs of their employees and their futures.
good,Job advancements are hard to come by.   The company seems to focus on certain employees instead of recognizing others for their contributions.
good,One of the most demanding jobs i've had. My supervisor was very picky about the way things were done and co-workers were not helpful or focused on their jobs (always gossiping).
good,jewelry department over all was very slow all the time. management was ok and at times helpful. Always worked alone didnt have more than one person at the jewelry department during one shift. most enjoyable was helping people shop for that special gift.
good,"The managers can not help you if you as an employee ask a manger for help they never know the answer. The store manager is never fully aware of the job's happenings. The customers are not put first, the HR wipes you off of the schedule when you try to discuss your availability, she will also allow you to go three weeks without any hours at all. & last, the store is filthy. Employees quit in less than month after being hired."
good,"Angela Decker runs the store as if it is High School and fuels drama. I loved being in customer service and I was very good at what I did, but the associates are full of drama."
good,I love the people I work with but the company overall seems to feel it is easier and cheaper to hire and train new employees than to simply retain the ones they have.
good,Minimum wage. I wouldn't go back. The managers told me i would get a sales position. They were only stringing me along because they needed some good cashiers.
good,"working for sears youll find great co-workers there but the bottom line sears sucks your pay is next to nothing their management system is set up so you don't know whose truly in charge, and you will hardly get a response atleast at my store.be prepaired for back stabbing so just go there do your work and leave though you can and will form great lasting friendships always watch your back and don't rely on the company for years to come just my opinion"
good,"I provided assistance when needed, management was not well thought out, and it required nights and weekends which is not ideal for having children."
good,A typical day was waiting on customers and listening to their complaints and getting yelled at. I was part of management but low on the pecking list. The best part of my job was working in the baby area and making it nice. Some of the managers would help in problems but some just wanted to stay in the office and be left alone.
good,it typital day at work for me was just keeping busy there was never nothing to do which was a good thing.i constantly hepled customers pulled merchendise  from the back.the hardest part of this job for me was being cashier because i would ge treally nerves when it came to intreacting with people.the most tjat o enjoyed about this job wass to keep busy.i love constantcy i like challanges.
good,I often wanted to quit but couldn't afford to. I tried to transfer to a cashier but was denied the oppurtunity even though I met the requirements and even got the required creditcard applications each week.
good,I did not like the atmosphere or the compensation. One of the worst managed companies I have ever worked at.
good,I was a cashier at the Sweetwater KMart and enjoyed the job and the interaction with the customers. The management team left a lot to be desired. The HR director never followed through on anything that was promised. The manager let others below him run the entire store regardless of what it was.
good,Signs are that Sears isn't doing well... Papers report. The company is old and not up with the times. Pushing customers to sign up for credit and shop your way rewards to the point of harassment. too much pressure not enough one on one customer service.
good,Management is horrible. Coworkers where the reason to work there. There was ever changing rules and policies. Nothing ever got done. Work was never finished in the store. Moving up in positions is hard to get. The best part of the job was the coworkers and the customers.
good,Very flexible environment and casual dress.  Very divided and segmented company with each piece only looking out for themselves.
good,The pay was not all that great but I had nice co workers who made a typical day at work fun
good,"6-8 Hour Days, cash handling, and sales floor pricing. Pretty cool job for a high school and/or college student"
good,A typical day at Sears in the protection agreement department consists of receiving incoming calls from Sears customers that are having problems with appliances purchased. I am in a decision making role where I listen attentively to the customer's complaints then make a decision how I can best assist them. It could be scheduling service and sending a technician to their home and in some cases even replacing the appliance that has failed
good,"The management treats you like property of the company. They aren't understanding to your life outside of work and if you aren't pushing product, you're bottom of the barrel. They'd rather you lie to customers and sell products than be honest and helpful."
good,You start working in the warehouse as soon as you get in and unload trucks.
good,i loved most of the people there i wished that they would pay more they kept adding more work to do but was not paying more money. you can deffiantly move up as long as you do your job. its a job
good,Company was great t work for in the early years but now is tapering off as a company in general. Spent 16 years working there.
good,Moving appliances in and removing old appliances from customers homes...
good,"- A typical day at work included faxing, filing, answering phone calls, reporting to management for miscellaneous duties, helping on the salesfloor, working with cash detail."
good,"I enjoy working with the public, I'm a perfectionist in everything I do, was raised that if you can't do it right don't do it at all. I take pride in my work ethics My co-workers have all commented on how much I'm enjoyable to work with."
good,at a desk with a phone doing customer service for Sears delivery.
good,"Work week was 38.5 hours to a max of 40 per week. A least two opening and closing per week."
good,"A typical day at work was putting new merchandise out, assisting customers always, and keeping the departments clean."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of cleaning the dressing rooms, taking returned items back from the registers, stocking new items, and visual merchandising.  I learned how to fold clothes properly, visual merchandising, and assisting customers.  Management was a bit confusing because they kept changing who the manager was.  Co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with everyone."
good,I enjoyed working for the company it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed shopping there as well. I learned a lot about patience and customer service it was interesting
good,I loves what I was doing.  Management did not want to hear from employees.  and for moving to supervisor there is no advancement in these positions.  hard for company to keep employees.
good,Retail is retail. they want you there and selling. There is no concern with the employee only the company.
good,Definitely would not recommend anyone to work here. Been there too long and now I get irritated everyday when I step in the door.
good,"I liked what I did, but the managment wasn't caring and didn't act like they cared about they're workers."
good,it was my first job i learned alot
good,"Lack of management skills, lack of communications, wages are terrible and overall not a place to work."
good,i unloaded all trucks that came in on a daily basis. I received all merchandise and replenished all merchandise. I dealt with merchandise pick up on a everyday basis as well. The company never offered any room to grow or any advancments in pay. There was no accomadations or incenitives for doing your job.
good,the management was OK. the pay was pretty average for what you do. but there was no team work at all.
good,Not the most efficiently run logistics department but they do get the job done.
good,cultural enviroment. productive activity . i enjoyed my time at sears
good,The good: Helping customers find what they need and the overall interaction with them. My fellow sales associates we're excellent people to work with. Everyone was helpful when I first started. It takes a special person to work retail and I did like it. You stand for your entire shift which didn't bother me. I worked on average 3 days a week due to going to school at the time.
good,"An average day for an In Store Marketing Representive you were required to walk the store floor and approach customers who are shopping and ask if they own their own home and if they did, you get them to tell you about their home owners needs and you set appointments based on their needs you had to use your own cell phone and call customer service department (right there on the floor) and put the customers on your cell phone and have customer service representive talk to your customer to confirm your appointments. Some C.S.R couldn't speak english every well or they took too long to comfirm your appointments and the customers would get fustrated and walk away and you sometimes would loose the appointments which you get bonus money for, because the base money is very small. Working in single standing stores was great you can make some good money. But the Malls stores are horrible very empty and in upper Middle class area all the customers claim that they have their own Construction Business and don't need Sears service, a lot people compliant about not liking Sears products, it was made even more harder by my incompetent Supervisor who didn't know about training and kept lying about what stores I was suppose to go to and giving the stand alone stores to her friends even though I was getting more bonus money and making more appointments than he was. They try to hold you responsible for the Sale Rep. not closing the sale, when all you can do is set appointments only. Take this job with your eyes wide open. They won't refund your cell phone usage or travel expences when you do Expo"
good,"Restock floor before store opens find online orders with time limit, load customers merchandise receive truck restock floor mid day. I've learned to multi task and be efficient, coworkers are best part of the job hardest job is management want's two people to handle whole store and helping customers with in a time limit."
good,"A typical day at work consists of loading and unloading appliances as fast as possible, as well as putting Appliances away the same way. I learned that productivity and saving money mean a ton to Sears as they didn't hire anyone after 12-15 employees were either fired or quit.Instead they just made the current employees work longer hours and expected none of them to be upset about not having a life outside of work.Management tries to motivate employees by observing job tasks to improve employee work habits which is not necessarily a bad thing because it does take time and hard work on the mechanics of the daily tasks to get faster but they continue to do this to employees that have years in at the facility. As for Co-workers about half have a negative attitude due to the way things are run and the way they are treated the other half just deal and try to make the best of what they have. The hardest part of the job is the hours you are required to work because you do not know how long your work day will be until the day of the shift. This could be helped if management actually cared that you may not want to spend your entire day at work and allowed for earlier start times more consistently. The most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself. Driving a lift is not a hard job and handling appliances shipping or receiving is not hard either but the management here make the job stressful and mostly aggravating by the way they view the employees."
good,"As a Merchandiser's Assistant I would come in and look on the board to see what role I will be playing today. On some nights you might be the lucky one to keep the floor,cash register, and fitting rooms clean of clothes left behind by customers. Other nights you will either be cleaning stockrooms, or putting out truck, which is not a hard job at all. The job really teaches you patience, and organization. Folding up the same table 3 times in one hour can be very nerve wrecking at times, especially when you still have other tasks that needs to be done before the day is out. The management at sears is in a recovery stage. With the store manager and assistant managers relatively new, at times there decisions don't coexist with one another. Being an MCA I am affected by this because once I am given directions from one manager, and I execute the task, it is not unusual for a manager to tell you to do it a different way. Meaning take it all down and put it back up a different way because they don't like the other manager's opinion in this project. My co-workers were the best because we treated each other like family. The hardest part about being an MCA would be having to answer a question you don't know the answer to, and the most enjoyable is working together in groups. It brings us together like the family we are."
good,"It's Sears,just a college kid at the time working a dead end job trying to pay my small bills at the time. Plus have some pocket money to have a life outside of class."
good,"A typical day at work would be trying to find an open computer to work on for the day. Management was not helpful and main concern was sales and not employees. I did not talk with other employees during the day. At the end of day discussed sales. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell items to customers who were already irate because their purchase (tractor,washing machine, lawn mower ,etc.) had broken."
good,Management was poor. I worked part time with full time hours except 1 week a month so they did not have to give me benifits. Pay was poor.
good,Answering angry customers all day. most of the kenmore products are horrible. managment is always changing and not for the better. co-worker are fun and just as upset as you. the hardest part is not being able to help the ccustomers properly. the most enjoyable would be the co workers.
good,"Responsible for researching and resolving part order delays. My responsibility is to manage inbound inquires, maintaining part"
good,"Its a ok job. For mechanics, pay is not good. Management doesn't even know about cars."
good,"not working at present time.managed 6 people,priced items,recieved merchandise"
good,I loved being there. It was a very big store an the first department store i ever worked in.
good,"Ok for a seasonal position, can do better on the exact end date."
good,"i loved the people that i worked with, but manager/owner was horrible. If it was just me and him working he would not help out at all. i could have 4-6 couple in the store looking at appliances and he would be on his computer or ipad playing games."
good,"Start with a meeting,check the floor to make sure all merchandises are ready fore the day,stocking,inventory,customer service. I have learned to be patience,and customer always right.Management were ok but my co-workers were excellent in all aspects.The hardest part of the job was making customers satisfied if they didn't like anything in the store.The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that customers are fully satisfied with everything."
good,Able to maintain service fleet. Maintained customer service. Shuttled parts and services.
good,The company is a known named company but has flawed due to its handling customers with 3rd party contractors.
good,"It definitely gave me confidence in running a automotive shop, because there were time when I had the garage to myself and had a lot of work to be done. The jab gave me conditioning, patience, and determination to have vehicles fixed quickly and correctly before leaving the shop. I learned how to open and close the shop, and gain experience to how to handle responsibilities to a greater scale. Most of all it gave me my experience to work on vehicles and machines that we all need and use on a daily bases."
good,"This company isn’t even open anymore, I don’t know why I was asked to write a review. It was a fairly decent place to work. Some of the employees got away with not treating customers fairly. Not cool!"
good,I only worked there for a short time before the company laid everyone off. It was a great experience.  If the company was to rehire and open back up. I would love to go back to work there.
good,Existe maltrato laboral en el departamento de perfumería.
good,"Management was more concerned about meeting quota, and had no concern for their employees.  They did not create a teamwork environment, and would time certain activities, for example : closing the store.  We were given 15 minutes to close, including cleaning, and if not completed, the work was left to the next shift to complete."
good,Doesn’t pay enough and you can’t be off on weekends because usually the managers get weekends off. If you work in jewelry you get paid 6.50 an hour plus commission
good,This is the worst place I've ever worked for. One manager lady didn't like me and always criticized me constantly. She made me feel real u comfortable.
good,"El horario laboral es muy largo, casi no te dan oportunidad de seguir estudiando"
good,At first I was excited but after working there for about a month I was treated poorly. Management talked poorly about employees to other Co workers. The managers the main manager would tell and degrade you in front of customers and other employees.
good,"Was a great place to work for , but over time the culture changed. The leadership became managers. I goaled myself to lead like those who forgot how to."
good,"I work at the sears by 9 month and first only give to the employee 15 hours per week or less, the regular employee absent and the temporaly have to take the task plus your in the same time. Not recomended to anyone because is stressful and the few hours give you one little salary (you work for the minimun) that not fair to the life cost in this days in puerto rico."
good,"Working at Sears was a good experience for me since I had never worked in retail stores before. I had good co-workers and some managers were good. The worst thing about working there was the pay, I spent 3 years earning the minimum wage."
good,"This is an entry level part time position, with amounts, quotas, etc that you need to attain, without reward other than maybe more hours in the future.  Basic retail position, poorly run company that has been going out of business for ten years, and it shows in management, quality and stock.  If you are desperate for a job, go ahead.  If you are looking for reliable hours with a living wage and not get burnt out in months, move past."
good,You only get a few hours a week and they short staff all departments and expect you to do the work that is normally done by 6 people in a 5 or 6 hour day. No shift is longer than 6 hours. I worked every single day for a month and got only the bare essentials paid for. It does not pay well at all. Don't work here. Management is stuck up and always has attitudes.
good,"Explained remodel of home, kitchen or bath and all products - drew up schematics and prices - sold products and contracted remodel through salesmanship."
good,Great company to work for but because of bankruptcy the future of the company is uncertain. Learned a lot from working with sears in a very short time.
good,"Did not want to do review. Worked very hard for company. Excelled in my job. Top performer 5 years in a row. Won many awards and trips. Had to have back surgery. Tried to come back after. Fired because I filed workmans comp. I was told the company did not have a position to accommodate my doctors imposed work restrictions. That was a lie. I was loyal, trained many technicians, instructed my manager how to make money in heating and air, made highest quarterly bonus for in home service tech. Over 6 years after being terminated Sears still will not settle disability case. I gave 6 days a week and an average of 10 + hours a day to be booted to the curb."
good,Vague direction from management. Learned alot about retail working at Sears. It helped me become a better organizer professionally and personally. Enjoyed my time of employment with Sears.
good,"This company salary is really low, and giving laid off to a lot of people so I can  not give a good review. I only work there 1 1/2 many years go so actually dotn know how is it now."
good,I generally liked job but they are in the process of selling to another company because of recent bankruptcy. Any complaints I may have had are not worth mentioning since the company will no longer be in existence soon.
good,"The hardest part of the job is that we are short staffed in my department.  One of the reasons is the pay, they start out with $8.00 and many people that apply for the job cannot make ends meet.  The stay long enough to get that first paycheck and leave because they have found another place of employment."
good,there is not much to say about this job it was ok for my firet job. olny worked a few days a week but worked a full 8 or 10 when i was working. in all it was an ok job
good,Promoted as a leads furnished job but all recent training and emphasis is on self generated leads. Sales position is not as advertised. They keep hiring more sales people when there are not enough leads for those that are already there.
good,"overall Sears Inbound Call Center excellent training, but too many layoffs no increase for 3 years.  Sears helped me with schedule.  Tech Specialist, Home warranty, delivery installation, customer service, constantly moving around, etc."
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone. A minimum wage job and management would expect you to do a job that required two people. Overall just horrible management.
good,"Our schedules were very flexible. Considering that I am student they were accommodating to my schedule. The managers were fair for the most part but I sensed a lack of communication sometimes with the rest of the associates. The environment was laid back for the most part, however, I did not appreciate the pressure we had to get customers to sign up for the credit cards."
good,"I enjoyed working with most of the employees at Sears.  the management team would change up every 6 months, this created a lack of direction for our store."
good,Ok to work at Sears. Not enough hours.  Minimum wage.  Management was nice. Not very busy store.  Close to home. Sometimes free lunch. Boss was flexible.
good,"The managers are always highly stressed. It made it difficult to do your job without them breathing down your neck about credit applications. They need to take some vacation days and do some online courses on management because it was too unprofessional. There was also this one old lady who's worked there for twenty years who was just plain mean, beware."
good,A typical day at work would consist of trimming down the line of customers that seems to never end. After the line of customers ends I would bring up the stock from the stock room which also doesn't ever seem to end.
good,"Not a long term job, never gave enough hours, but if you're busy with school then you should be fine. Do not attempt to work there if you cannot stand on your feet for a long time."
good,"Had a terrible experience, when attempting to get help you would get blamed, and ostracized. even after going to their ethics division little changed, had to go to OSHA to see any actual changes."
good,"I started off liking my job here but after about a year, the jobs demands became more and more but the pay stayed the same.  In the almost 2 years there, I did not get a raise or bonus.  There was no health care (I realize being a part time employee may have limited that) or benefits besides a store discount.  Management was unapproachable."
good,"Its a good working place for student who really want or need the money, offer overtime at that time i was working over there i don't mind to work over there again it will be better if they pay more due to the work over load and stress."
good,"*A typical day involved consulting customers on product benefits and features."
good,Falta de motivación mala paga y no valoran lo que haces por la empresa
good,Not to bad of a place to work if you are wanting to learn how to become a sales person pay was ok but you had to put yourself out there and make sales you can’t really be scared of talking to people of you are then this isn’t a place to work
good,"Sears used to be a fantastic place to work, not any more. The turnover is so high that if you stay longer than 6 months they will put into the manager in training program. Managers are overworked and are given unrealistic goals to achieve and no time to do it. So much so that they can no function on training or help on the floor. Recent cuts have shifted jobs responsibilities to workers who don't have the necessary skills to be successful. Very sad to see how far they have fallen."
good,"A typical day consists excruciating truck labor."
good,"I learned a great deal from many people who I had the pleasure to work with over the years. I enjoyed the clerical associates I was in charged of, they worked hard and was willing to fill in where ever I was short staff. A typical day started with going over any accounts that was not paid investigating why the vendor was not paid and creating a manual payment. I then have to check to make sure all staff was at work on time and if someone called in sick to get a replacement to cover that job."
good,I learned a lot about management in this position not all good but most of it was positive and constructive worked a lot of long hours but learned a lot about time management
good,Days started with staff meetings to discuss issues and what will be the long term and short term sales goals. High turn over of part time staff members not properly informed on product features.
good,I suffered a house fire while working here which ultimately forced me to leave this job. It was a fast pace job and it learned a lot. there is nothing else that i have to say about this job. I been stopped working here.
good,Management was very difficult to work for but overall i enjoyed my job helping customers with their needs. I also enjoyed working in the parts bays maintaining inventory.
good,"The store is very corporate, so they follow very strict rules and guidelines. Being a cashier was more time demanding than what it was set out to be. The other coworkers were great and nice, would recommend working there if you need and want plenty of hours."
good,Bosses walked around like hall monitors watching every move you make. 
good,"There isn't much to say about Sear's.  I only worked there a short time and did not have a chance to evaluate the pros and cons of the business.  I worked as a replacement for someone who was terminated and was a fill in.  As such I had many of the lesser jobs, such and cleaning the compactor (used to crush) boxes and other forms of recyclable material.  I also assembled display and such."
good,"I had a great job but my son passed away a year ago, I needed to work in a job that wasn't so much pressure so I went back to Sears as it was a fun and friendly environment while I was learning how to deal with my grief, I am ready to get back into the work force now."
good,Slow paced environment.  Late night shifts.  Mediocre benefits and salary.  It's a good place for students that need a flexible schedule and only need to support a family with this income.
good,Extremely stressful job and poor management .Summer months you work long hours your computer malfunctions.You are hired as a technician but they try to make you sell all their products.
good,"Ok, workplace."
good,The job was okay to be fair and the pay wasn't very high on top of that there were too many employees in one place so they were reducing hours tremendously
good,No hay un sueldo solo comisiones no tiene buen horario
good,"Sears is a fast paced environment, and it can be a friendly place to work. The managers are a little unorganized and only care about one thing, how many credit applications you sell per shift."
good,"You handle transactions for customers. Working the register was fairly comprehensive. However, you do have to ask too many questions and that usually irritates customers."
good,"A typical day is spent working for 9-10 hours, having maybe 1 customer through the day to make MAYBE $2 when you're a 100% commission salesperson. That's everyday for a 5-6 day work week, sometimes you'll get lucky and get a few customers in a day, but very unlikely where I worked. Management was very hands-off in my department because we did such low volume compared to tools, lawn & garden and appliances. Hardest part was making no money, but doing so much work (ringing random stuff throughout the day that you make no commission on, putting away freight that has no relevance to your department whatsoever). The only thing I enjoyed was my coworkers, other than that, there was nothing else to enjoy."
good,"Management not good to employees, treat you like paid slave laborer,"
good,"Al that is left is the pride of being at Sears. Staff will continue to do the best job they can regardless of the black hole that is the future. remaining staff will be asked to go above and beyond( a common occurrence previously) but there is no reason to ultra-perform..but staff will be professionals and do the best job they can...a statement as to the quality of associates that were ""SEARS""..."
good,Sales and people interaction. Fast pace during the holidays. Ordering purchases and restocking sales floor. Sales quotas and warranty paperwork. Hardest part was you was always on your feet the whole day.
good,"As many people know, there has been Sears stores closing all over. No job security and at call all the time. Management is okay but can get intense if any audits etc are near. Not too professional"
good,Unfortunately our company is restructuring and the outcome is unclear.these problems I can only continue to work hard and serve my customers to the best of my abilities and hope our company can survive.                         Thanks
good,"Had a fantastic few managers as supervisors but had terrible general management and district management. Working long hours all the time, without incentive and without chance at advancing in wage or position."
good,"A typical day was usually solitary. I learned much of my money handling skills through Sears. Management was always changing and the third party cleaners stole money from employees, including myself."
good,Got laid off while on maternity and will get no severance. Terrible people to work for. Made just barely over minimum wage when they cut our commissions
good,"I worked here as a seasonal employee in high school and was treated so unfairly and the older employees were rude to me. I did gain better communication skills assisting customers, but that was the only enjoyable part."
good,"Sears was a stressful work environment with no benefits whatsoever. The turnover rate is horrible, and management doesn't seem to care about anything but credit card application."
good,My store was closed so that is the reason why I am posting my resume.  If anyone is not aware of what is happening at SHLD then I don't know what more to say.
good,The stress that management gets from higher ups trickles easily down to the associates. Becoming increasingly frustrating to work here. Work is either extremely lonely and slow or busy with frustrated customers. It has its good days which we cherish but just be prepared for a lot of changes with no notice.
good,management was very poor  never had a set schedule and was not moving up in job any the owner never would keep store with what we needed  we had to buy it
good,lower level guys in shop did extra and depended more on lower level beginning of 2016 job got a little more interesting after offering incentive made it a little more worth all the hard work
good,As of 2017 sears is in a downward spiral with no end in sight. Deep cuts in budgets creates a stressful work environment. Hourly turnover is a mess. Most people leave before they are terminated.
good,Stressful workplace with un-even customer traffic that affects commissions; Since Sears Holdings Corporate has been having financial issues and closing stores.  Sears' future is in doubt.
good,This company is going under quickly. They do not take care of their employees. Their benefits aren't worth the hassle they put you through. The management was hit or miss. This is not a company you want to work for if you want job security.
good,"Sears was a very good learning opportunity for me. I enjoyed the day to day business that had to be attended to, such as setting goals for associates, and following up with progress throughout the day. The job itself, is very rewarding and enjoyable. What makes it difficult is upper management, your talked down to and treated like dirt. But my main problem is not knowing from day to day when your position will be eliminated. It is a very stressful place to work."
good,"The managers pick favorites, they don't do anything and expect you to do all the work while they take 6+ smoke breaks daily. Don't forget they don't get off their chair or phone."
good,"Arrive at work on a couple cars, mostly doing oil changes and flat repairs Then sit around and do nothing until just before closing then you get a small rush off cars."
good,"This was the Sear in Panama City. The manager I had was not so good. He played favorites a lot. harassment involvement took place with him and several employees. Constantly, felt like I was being watched. Some employees were helpful and nice but most were not."
good,"They care more about the top dollar than the customers, all They want is customers info  and trying to sell them stuff they don't need.  They don't really care for the employees.  The employees are nothing but numbers to them ."
good,Sears is the worst job I have had since moving. The place was always hot with no AC. No opportunity for advancement. The managers talk about the staff.
good,"The hardest part of the job was selling credit cards, there were days that I never made it to my area and was asked how many credit cards I got. "
good,"Sears was a fine place to work as long as you are not looking to advance to far. The environment was stressful and ultimately unfulfilling. I would say it is a good place to work if you are just starting in the workforce and want to get your feet wet however, not a good career"
good,"El plantilla de trabajo no estaba completa y no era posible terminar todas las actividades que se tenían programadas en tiempo y forma."
good,"Working in commission sales was fun, on busy days its nice because you get a lot of sales, slow days are the worst but you get through it................"
good,"hours based supposed to be based on performance, not always the case. slow work day, not generally very busy. easy work, they train you so you know what you are selling"
good,"tiene beneficios, pero no hay sueldo base y hay quincenas que no sacas ni para los camiones"
good,"Job is ok only down side is the pressure to sale which is not told to you until you start, job really does not have a lot of advancement  to grow . But If you like working on appliances it pretty cool."
good,"So many responsibilities, slow, not enough hours, great leads, not enough employees on the job, other employees are rarely helpful, sometimes too strict"
good,"employees where broken up by department. So you would only work in the clothes, shoes, bedding/mattresses, or electronics etc. The clothes employees where always overworked because their job could be a little more hectic."
good,great job be better if they can schedule me more then one day a week and feels they don't value my work ethic. sears is a good company but management need to improve and have better flexible work  scheduling.
good,"Mala administración de recursos humanos y gerencia en la sucursal que labore, discriminación por estado de gravidez."
good,"The managers basically are people who have been there long enough so they just move them up. They really push you to open credit cards, and if you don't you get written up. The hours vary every week so you don't usually get the schedule from the week before"
good,"Handled Cash, open credit accounts, processed returns and open credit accounts also helped customer with whatever questions they had and other customer service inquiries"
good,"I worked for this company for 16 years. I got laid off when the company eliminated my position. They gave the most comparable position to a guy who had been with the company for about a year. I assume he got paid less to do the same job so they went with him. I had to fight for every raise I got and only in the last 6 months of my employment there was I making the amount I should have been making for my tenure with the company. The company is not stable and has been closing stores, I don't see it as good job security anyway."
good,"This job is good for beginners trying to learn how to be in a work environment.  It was a good job to learn how to work register, to stock shelves, and to get experience in customer service."
good,Working at Sears can either be a wonderful place or a horrible place to work. It all depends on you. You have to learn how to remain calm when a customer is upset because that is your department.
good,"This job is about as easy as it gets but I'm surprised this location has not closed yet. Management is bad, there is no advancement, they did away with an employee discount, and the shelves are hardly stocked.. though corporate has a lot to do with this.. hours are not properly advertised so no one comes in passed regular operating hours (which is both a + and -)."
good,"work life balance is good"
good,"Working at Sears seems like it can be Okay for a retail Job, but in reality It feels like us as associates should be scared for their jobs. We to management are just another person who can be replaced. "
good,"Typical day included customer service, answering phones, scheduling deliveries, selling mattresses.  Assisting in other departments as needed.  Stocking shelves (what little belonged to our dept).  Changing signs to reflect current sales."
good,"A typical day at work was always hectic-- do this, do that, why haven't you finished the other yet? I learned that some people are not meant to be managers. Management chased off all of the good help by nagging them about PA's,etc. People didn't like to be treated like that. My co-workers made my job endurable. The hardest part of the job was answering to someone who thought she was perfect. I loved my job though. I loved helping the employees and customers; that was the most rewarding. I think if someone had just left me alone to do my job instead of questioning every move I made, I might have a good review. As it stands, they made me very unhappy in the end."
good,"I loved working with the crew I had at Sears, but due to the financial instability of the company a lot of procedures would change frequently as they would liquidate positions. The need to push 22 metrics was so desperate that most associates resorted to immorally obtaining their numbers. "
good,have not work there long enough to make comments etc. Did not get the chance to learn more about company  layoff occurred too soon very disappointed with short experience
good,"employees are fun to work with, at least the constant ones. management isn't so great. management has had many different people working in the store. some are constant and some are not."
good,Low pay not enough people to work  you get in trouble for not making people get debit cards you can get fire . Customers are rude .
good,"Sears fails to advance both technologically and in the business of 'taking care of their employees'. The benefits are horrendous and the pay does not equal the work done. Sears far well below industry standard on salaries paid. Sears could be great again if they got rid of the CEO, took better care of their employees, and put money in the restructuring and redesign of the stores left."
good,no recognition for a job well done. no continual improvement to staff. not all co-workers knows how to play as a team. very reliable managers.
good,"Making sure that all customers received the perfect service was my daily task. Also, to insure that the techs arrived on time and completed the job correctly each an every time. Made sure the customers was satisfied with the service they received from Sears Techs."
good,"It's an OK work environment, for the most part. However the management is not so good, very unprofessional. The Tech's are a good group to work with, also."
good,"Sears, honestly is one of the places I would say needs balance and too strict. Breaks are too short, and no sitting areas. Everybody complains about everything which is not good."
good,"Always worked with a great group of associates. Company was always over burdening employees with unnecessary tasks and jobs, and less focused on customer care."
good,"Even though I exceeded in every category, You never knew what was about to happen. The store closed 6 months after I got another job."
good,"2016  04  13  At the Outlet, there is no job security, opportunity for advancement, growth, and there is no compensation or benefits, as I am part-time for a year now, and am ready to move forward with my life."
good,The management team is comprised mostly of people who have spent their entire career working for one company.  No room for advancement outside the District Level.  Very little room for advancement within each District.
good,"Disappointed in the environment"
good,Ok place to work if you're just looking for extra cash. No room for advancement. Pay is minimum wage and from what I've been told and after being there for almost a year there are NO raises. People just do whatever they want and there really is no discipline. Basically the people that actually do their job don't get the recognition they deserve. Most of the people are easy to get along with but the management could be a little more strict.
good,Coworkers were fun to work with.  Job was easy and different everyday.  Lots of interaction with customers which was a plus for my personality.
good,"Working at Sears in Sudbury, Ontario was a learning experience for me. I had not had a sales associates position for electronics prior to this position and I had to quickly read all manuals on the variety of brands and  models of products sold in order to give the customers an informed opinion on the products they were considering purchasing.  I enjoyed helping the customers, and working towards their satisfaction."
good,"Dedicated hard working team with a passion for fashion. Many brands and category to manage, no shortage of work. Interface with numerous teams on multiple reduce calendar to complete varies task. "
good,"Worked in the lawn/garden department and if you don't sell, you don't make money, meaning not a happy paycheck.  Only good for part timers."
good,"great place to work but if you leave or take a early retirement & you try to come back,even if they need to hire qualified  technicians badly, They will not consider you at all"
good,"Recibo y chequeo de mercancía, como tratar al cliente, buena presentación personal, platica departamental diaria para platicar metas y retos por cumplir, y vídeos de superación personal."
good,"I used to love this company! I learned so much things, met so many people, advanced to so many different positions to better advance my knowledge. But, this company has changed so much, its no longer enjoyable to work there."
good,"I was a office assistant at sears and the management was horrible. I only stayed at that job until I finished school, just to help pay the bills."
good,"This was a part time job for me during undergrad, so I don't feel as if I'm the end-all-be-all authority reviewer for this job."
good,"Has a great owner but you really cannot advance because it is privately owned. sales, warehouse work, or delivery and installation. those are the only jobs that are available. The work was steady and reliable."
good,"Poor management, old and dangerous fixtures, and unreliable resource. I did have good and supportive co-workers here. That's all we had was each other."
good,Work Sears truck/stock and help out on register and customers. Work at your own pace and rarely given tasks to do by management
good,"typically I was responsible for performing oil and tire changes however, there was room for advancing my career but it never became available due to the store closing."
good,"They promise hours but do not deliver, Business is bad and management yells at you and curses at you in front of customers"
good,There a company who wants you to do more work for minimum pay. Your not promoted based upon experience and being the best for the job your promoted based on who you know.
good,I enjoy working in a fast paced always something to be done and must be able to multi task must have knowledge of computers and pebble
good,"I enjoy my time at Sears, but do not like the continuous push to make each and every customer apply for the Sears charge card."
good,"Dealing with customers with problems with their kitchen appliances and trouble shoot it on phone, if not capable to troubleshoot, I send out a Technician to customer's house. I set up the appointment and time."
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers. Ensuring their happiness and making sure they found what they needed. I learned how to work a cash register, two versions, a touch screen and a key board (9 key). Management is not the best. My co-workers are fun to work with. We always stay on task and we get our job done. The hardest part of the job is getting people to open our credit cards. Its not the getting to people to sign up, its when you don't and management doesn't take it lightly because the store is doing bad."
good,"A typical day at work started with clocking in at 1 a.m. We usually had anywhere between 1 and 3 tractor trailers to unload. After unloading said trailers and putting them in their respective locations throughout the warehouse, we then checked over the placements to ensure accuracy. Then we would assemble/alter appliances/etc before the delivery men arrived. Once they arrived, we would answer any questions and handle any discrepancies from the delivery workers. After they loaded their trucks and headed out for the day, we then did miscellaneous work around the warehouse (organization, inventory, etc) until independent installation workers arrived with old or wrong product from the day prior. "
good,"If you meet your goal for sales, you mainly kept job. Sears has a high turn over rate. So its hard to keep up with demands of corporate."
good,The employees at Sears are a lot of fun to work with. By far the most enjoyable part of the job was when you could really help a customer out.
good,This company had one of the best managers in the electronics department I tried to emulate when I moved on to my management position. now the company in it self well they were horrible there pay grade is 6 dollars an Hour + com  which there rates were good to start then the changed the rates so working there was a displeasure. also had some terrible coworkers who like stealing sales  which made me give up this job couldn't work for the peanuts they were paying
good,"selling and helping customer"
good,"everyday was the same thing over and over again. Horrible work environment as tension build up amongst employees. Eventually this place closed down, and I can definitely see why."
good,This job was amazing when I first started. Then I started doing the work of a manager and was not being paid like the other managers were. I was there for a year and in the time they had such a high turn over rate that it was almost impossible to run the store. The high turn over rate was due to so many other higher paying jobs. It taught me how to manage my time better and how to be a better leader though and how to help people help themselves.
good,It is a good company to work for to get industry/ corerate experience but you always have to keep a look out for other opportunities because there is not enough advancement or security
good,people get fired for no reason its kind of annoying and impractical. the job overall needs better people managing. security really doesnt do their job and you will not get paid enough
good,Working at Sears was a learning experience. I do recommend this time of job for first time workers. The company needs a lot of more experience with relating with their clients.
good,New management and ownership changed the sales culture and thereby limited the ability of experienced sales persons to make a living. The cut commissions in half and forced retirement on senior career sales people. The team morale suffered and sales suffered as a result.
good,"A typical work day is hearing complaining customers about the company. I also do too much work for the pay that I am getting. They also told me I would never get a raise and they don't want me to be full time. Yet, I'm working full time hours."
good,"Job is challenging and fun and working at cutting edge of mobile app dev/tech. A lot of very talented people here, but because of the financial state of the company, hard work is not rewarded"
good,"I enjoyed the work "
good,Sales Associate can make a lot of money in sales. The work environment is fun and the managers are very helpful and supportive.
good,"Good job for the mean time but it lacked any capability of moving up from the job. But as a temporarily, it was great for gaining customer service skills."
good,"This job is more of a sales position. Everyday is something new. But, what I have learned about this job is, you need to have a of of patience. You will get many negative answers from people but your main goal is to keep on going. Management is great but the job is really challenging. Even though I am up for any challenge but patience is something you need the most to survive."
good,"Nearly everyone in the store is two-faced.  The credit card applications kill everyone, because they don't tell you in the beginning that they are the whole part of you job.  And, you will loose it if you don't get a certain number of them every week."
good,"Working with salesmen to accomplish daily sales. It could be stressful meeting so many dead lines, but mulit-tasking and prioritizing you are able to accomplish all that is required to get done for that day."
good,Sears is a cool place.I only worked there seasonal.I wish i ahd more opportunities at this place
good,"Management was way off, schedule was never done in advance, couldn't plan anything for family/friends and after Christmas, only got 4 hours per week or work! Definitely was not worth the time, gas or money..."
good,"The customers and co-workers were mostly friendly. However, Sears seemed to be overly concerned about service plans and credit card applications. They cared more about them than customer satisfaction."
good,I unloaded trailers put together skids brought them up to the departments helped customers when needed. I also shipped packages
good,A typical day of work will start out somewhat disorganized. You can expect a list of tasked to do that is to long for the day and more being thrown at you though the day. The fast you work and try to get jobs accomplished the more you are interrupted and then questioned about unfinished tasks. In the last few years it has become a confusion in the making.
good,"The flavors of the month are more like flavors of the day.  Attention seems to be less and less on driving GREAT Customer Experiences, and more about enrolling Customers into their loyalty program."
good,"Enjoyed working with people.  Unfortunately, not enough hours and it was only seasonal."
good,"Recently i was hired to work for sears call center. All communication was via email, after receiving several different emails with conflicting dates. I tried to contact someone by phone. I was directed to voicemail. Were calls were not returned until one day before 1 st day of work. I reported to work and requested another date to start. Due to all conflicting emails. And i had a prior appointment .    I was told no. Later that day i given permission to arrive late the following day.( too handle prior appointment. ) and when i came in the next day I was terminated for being late.  I feel as the recruiters totally let me down facilitating my schedule. And in the end I lost my job!!!!!"
good,"selling appliances to members, I felt company was more concerned with the bottom line the customer satisfaction."
good,"At this job my fellow co-workers and I would work together to accomplish our tasks. "
good,"Supervisor was an easy going guy, but when work needed to be done he let us know in a stern tone.  For the most part though he made my time at Sears enjoyable."
good,"after 11 years working for company, I can tell you that this company is going down the drain. You don't get any recognition, management is horrible (from corporate level to store)  sales commissions are low, they don't focus on local market."
good,"Management is not the best. Needs a lot of improving when it comes to talking to their associates. Work can be stressing when dealing with management, excelent co-workers."
good,"I ran electronics in this job, you would come in turn all the TVs on, make sure the area was clean. Review orders from customers that you may have sent them out to, prep the area and see what was on the days agenda. Management does not really offer a way to advance and sometimes lacks the key skills needed to be more efficient."
good,"The way management would run the company was not efficient, customer service was not where it needed to be to ensure customer returns. A typical work day consisted of me clocking in and walking around blending in with customers."
good,Laid back work place. I only met me Manager once in passing. Enjoyed recommending products that met the Customer's needs.
good,"Sears a friendlier place than most other places I worked for.  However, it needs to take employee's views into consideration and value retention of good employees."
good,"Nice place &good location"
good,This job was a good beginner job for those that havent experience the work force.
good,"besides the fact that the atmosphere helped me to improve my skills, there was a lot of favoritism going on and not enough room for growth."
good,"Sears, "
good,"I come in check all signs to make sure they are correct, I constantly greet people walking by or as they come up to the counter, I learned about a lot of different metals, diamonds , carat weights etc. the hardest part of my job is selling because we don't get many customers, but I still keep a smile on my face! the enjoyable part of my job is finding the right piece of jewelry for the customers taste."
good,"Sears employees are overworked, underpaid and under-appreciated. There was no recognition or reward for accomplishments, providing little incentive to do better, less the fear of losing your job. The work was easy, at least."
good,"Hours were crazy week to week... anywhere from 6 to 36 hours. It was a bit much to work here while in school. The management was mediocre at best, the store management worked in fear of the store manager who worked in fear of the district manager who was a fire breathing tyrant. All of my coworkers were inexperienced due to the high turnover rates and minimum wage pay. A typical day at work consisted of a CONSTANT and overwhelming push for metrics, and of course Sears Credit Card sign ups... the hardest part of the job was the backhanded praise. We would be praised for achieving one metric, but that praise was great leverage to coach us (in a demeaning and public manor at the morning meetings) on our less ""superstar"" metrics. The best part of the job was learning the skills I did in selling and ""asking for the sale"" but it was demeaning to be making hardly over minimum wage."
good,"Sears was a very slow paced place to work, and I did not like that at all. It was not very organized, and entirely too crowded. There were days I would come to work and even the managers couldn't agree which section for me to work in that day."
good,"A typical day at work includes a lot of bending, cleaning, condensing, lifting, moving stuff around, helping customers, and standing at the cashier. I've learned to not let negativity affect my work and professionalism. The management at Sears could use some help because they aren't very organized. My co-workers are alright. Some people need to mind their own business and focus on what they have to get done, instead of focusing on what other people are doing and speaking negatively about others behind their backs. The hardest part about this job is having to constantly clean up after customers, especially when the area was cleaned up not too long ago. The most enjoyable part about this job is helping customers out, being able to give advice to customers about what looks good on them, what matches with what, and to just simply have great friendly conversations with the customers. The breaks are also wonderful too!"
good,for type of work that i do in store not being paid for what it.Do many different jobs that no once dose.
good,"•Troubleshoot Household Refrigerators/Freezers"
good,"When I started working at Sears, it was a fun place to work but then they changed management and it became hell.  Salaries were frozen, position responsibilities were changed, people were not given options of what they wanted and so there were frustrations all around.  Then stores were closed and although jobs were guaranteed when trasfers were initiated people were sent to stores the management kne would be losing and after two months of trasfer we were out in the cold again this time no guaranteed jobs.  Packages won't be satisfactory considering that salaries have been frozen for seven years.  "
good,"Answering calls. Listening to customers concerns. Bringing solutions. Problem solving"
good,"As a company in transition, you will be tested and and tried daily at Sears. However, you will be given multiple chances to prove yourself day in and out. "
good,Learning and knowledgeable with full training with hands on experience for customer service and customer support.
good,"While I was employed at this location, the store was under new management.  He mistreated employees so badly that I witnessed people who had been with the company 15+ years retire early just to be away from him. There were no clear cut job descriptions.  At times I was sent to departments where I had not received any training and expected to perform duties of which I had no knowledge.  My coworkers were very pleasant,competent, and hard working. The only benefit of working for Marion Sears was the merchandise discounts."
good,"This was my first job. I took pictures of couples, children and families. I always felt very confident about my work because I had customers tell me that I took some of the best pictures of their children. My co workers were great friends and I enjoyed working with them. My management was out through the time I was working there because she had just had a baby. Assistant management was the one in charge and my hours weren't enough and she played favoritism to her daughters friends who worked there with me. I actually was very happy when the season was up."
good,Sears is a good place to start but not a place to build a career. Day starts 7:00 until finished. I learned how to diagnose and repair laundry equipment . The pressure of the job caused management to be more finger pointers than managers you are on your own. Coworkers were like family. The hardest part was doing two men jobs by yourself . The best part of the job was everyday was different.
good,not only are you challenged every day but if you do not meet your outrageous goals set expect to get your hrs cut your over worked criticized and not even trained properly its a popularity contest good work isnt appreciated yet first mistake managers will be in your face only good thing is that they work with your schedule kinda
good,"This company lacks great people, and the managment is awful."
good,its a ok job. if I had to chose between sears and somewhere else I would leave.
good,"This was a part time position while at school. It taught me customer service and a sales perspective. However, it was not my area of interest"
good,A typical day at work consist of working on the register and assisting the sales floor team with maintaing the store's cleaniness.Also fixing the signing and placement of our promotions and deals while pushing freight onto the floor.
good,"A typical day of work usually started with clocking in anywhere, going to my register serving cutomers. Sears does provide great discounts and rewards programs for both employees and customers. Managment was friendly and non-descriminant as well as the coworkers. The hardest part for me was reaching credit account sign up quotas. I did not have enough hours to gain enough exposure to gather the required amount to exceed probation. As always helping people find what they are looking for is very self rewarding."
good,Fast paced environment with challenges which test your abilities.  Turnover and morale affect ones ability to work without handling pressure and stress. Good exposure to being noticed.
good,"Typically there were only a  few customers a day in electronics, which made it difficult to work off of commission."
good,"a typical day at work for me was getting there being on time, I learned how hard it is behind closed doors that a csr works. I learned how to keep my cool in desperate times. my coworkers was fun to be around sometimes but I rather just get my work done and communicate later. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers attitude. and the most enjoyable part was meeting nice teammates and customers"
good,Sears was a very enjoyable place to work but held many challenges in management. There was a constant power struggle in managers and employees were forced to choose sides over petty drama. I believe it is very unprofessional to have such drama in management relationships with each other in several incidents.
good,"Good job if you need something to get through high school. Turn over rate is high, pay is low."
good,"I learned how to:"
good,"Not sure what to say... I was very hard to find order in the mist of chaos.  Understaffed, underpaid, and usually a mess.  But before the new management took over we all seemed to figure out how to make it work."
good,not the best place to work and management could have been better
good,I enjoy working for Sears but I  want to go farther and I don't think I will be able to advance here.
good,"Typical work day was cashing out customers, learned that pretty much all Sears was worried about was getting people to sign up for credit cards. They based your hours off how many credit cards you got people to sign up for. Management was ok but they honestly did not care that much about YOU in general. Hardest part of the job was trying to get people to sign up for credit cards. Most enjoyable I honestly don't even know."
good,"Compensation and benefits not great, some very nice intellegent co workers others are not kind at all. Expectations are alot with no compensation for exceding the required work. I take an average of 40 extra calls beyond the daily requirement as do others with no reward or compensation. Company has a hugh turn over rate."
good,"typical day consists of returns, dressing rooms, unloading the truck, freight, pick lists, price checks, jewelry dept., cashier, planograms/resets, assisting customers"
good,"good place to work, i was only seasonal but i enjoyed myself."
good,"The days at work were usually from 12pm to 9pm with very little traffic. I worked in electronics but usually got called to other departments to translate for other associates and didn't get paid anything extra for my time. Even though it was hourly plus commission based pay, every time I asked for a raise managements response was to sell more which was very difficult considering that there were very few customers. Management only cared about their numbers and was always great at pointing out negatives and not doing much to boost employee moral. Worked for 7 years without a raise and hours were dropped to a mere 5 hours a week when ""the numbers"" were low. Spent most of the time doing the restocking putting out signs and reorganizing because management wouldn't hire someone to fill that job position which was open for quite some time. "
good,"work long hours, no raises- company has not given raises in 6 years-"
good,I am a in-home tech so we are pretty much on or own. We work from are homes and need to be self motivated. 
good,It's a tough place to work if you like your weekends off.  Still I would hard pressed to find a better lead person to work for.  Too bad the general manager turned out to be less than desirable.
good,"Always ranked the highest in sales in the Electronics department but it was retail and never could plan anything because schedule changed every week."
good,Customer satisfactions was and is always a main concern of the store manager. He would go out of his way to insure the satisfaction of a customer every time. 
good,Company has lost its way.  Its sad as they were once a great company.  Too much focus on metrics and not enough on customer service.
good,A typical day at work consists mostly of assisting customers and maintaining the sales floor to be kept clean and presentable at all times. The environment among my co-workers is kept light and fun with banter and occasional jokes. From this job i have learned time-management skills and how to effectively multi-task. 
good,Sears is a wonderful way to try and work your way up in a business they give the tools to do so.
good,"I somewhat enjoyed my time at Sears. it was pretty routine, simple and easy. pay was awful and every week your schedule was different which didn't work out for me."
good,"Very repetitive job, learned to follow corporate strategy, you do not have any input in terms of changing to adapt to new ways. Most everyone working at Sears are great people. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make appropriate changes to the way bussiness is conducted today. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to make a difference in sales by motivating staff and coaching them to be more effective"
good,"On any given day I work with anywhere from two to ten different customers who come in looking to purchase a new appliance. My job is to assist each customer in finding the right appliance to fit their needs. While in this position I have learned how to ask customer general discovery questions and use those answers to lead them to the right product. I have learned how to handle all types of customers and how to have a good time while doing my job. The hardest part of the job is when customers have complaints or problems with their appliances and I have to find the best way to help them while staying within my guidelines. The most enjoyabe part of the job is when I have a satisfied customer. When a person leaves my store with a smile on their face and are genuinely excited about their purchase, I know I've done my job correctly and it feels great to have happy customers."
good,"i feel that i had a lot of fun at this job, the only thing i would change is a lot of managers there played favorites and did not follow all the rules correctly for every associate."
good,"The usual day consist of keeping warehouse clean and organized, every item located, garbage free environment. Spend most of the time assisting customers with their needs of trying to return or pick up merchandise. Twice a week, receiving and unloading a truck, to clean up afterwards by unpacking new items and locating them to proper area."
good,"Working there has definitely taught me more then what i know and im thankful for it, but as for management it was absolutely horrible. The manager didn't know a thing about automotive and was struggling to balance everything he had to. As for the co-workers some were eager to work as for others didn't really want to do anything."
good,"answering phone customer service, the hardes was selling roducts that some of the clients didnt really need, manager was great , work enviroment good"
good,"A typical day, was working with very impatient, demanding customers."
good,Its ok for seasonal only u never have just 1 register u may w ork on every1 in the store within two days
good,"You had to get an ipad before you can get on the sales floor but managers were suppose to give them out but it was always a pain for them to get one for an associate. I learned alot about our products like matresses, vacuums, microwaves,etc. Management was a hassle every time you page a manager for an approval or something they would take forever and the customers would get impatient. My co workers were ok as workers but they would always make me cover for them but when it came down to me it was a problem. The job was easy though what I hated is that the commission is terrible. I enjoyed working with other people and interacting and finding their needs"
good,I really enjoyed my job at Sears Holdings. I worked for the automotive department handling customer service and sales by phone and Internet. I think it's a great place to work however the management is lacking experience and work ethics.
good,"i worked at sears holdings for 5 years and was recently fired for doing what a manager told me to do. which included marking down the price of merchandise to cover for a merchandise protection agreement. a typical day at sears was very boring there with little to no selling activity. being on commision was great when it was busy but rarely it was busy. management was terrible the store manager came across as disingenuous. if you did something wrong he rarely said anything to you, but attacked your department manager. the department manager often used fear tactics and unethical tricks to make you achieve your monthly and yearly selling metrics. the hardest part of the day was clocking in, i hardly ever wanted to be there and the only reason i stayed so long is b/c it was close to where i live. the best part of the day was talking to the other hourly co-workers in my department. and the wonderful customers"
good,Sears used to be a fun place to work at until New managment came in but the lack of raises was very discouraging.
good,"Its what you expect out of part time retail, not much. This job in particular was under waged for the conditions you had to undergo. Management was lacking but tried hard."
good,scheduling was not recived at proper times.over worked underpaid
good,Good place to work if your coming right out of highschool or if your currently in highschool
good,"I enjoyed work at Nabob Cafe in sears...I learned about food site. How to deal with castomer and co workers. My supervisor was really very nice & helpful. Hardest part of the job, really nothing to mentioned."
good,"When the economy was rough, sears was there to give me a job and i am grateful for that."
good,the owners were my ex in laws but it was a good job i had a lot of fun and really like the job i learned a lot to
good,"A typical work day consist of setting up your cash wrap for the days activities which include making sure you have enough change in your register, enough bags to put clothes in, and making sure there wasn't a mess left form the night before."
good,If you are looking for a part time or a job just for pocket change then this is the place
good,Loyalty not recognized. Job threatened daily. Degraded always. Neveer any praise. Used and dumped. We just waited to see who didn't show up for a few days. No communication.
good,I learned quickly and contributed alot but was not really rewarded for the good work. Store shortly closed down.
good,"When I first started working at Sears I was promised that I could change my hours at any time and they would be approved, I was lied to. The management at Sears in Fox Valley is poor. They dont treat their employees very well and that is a big part of why I decided to leave. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with my co workers"
good,"Sears is a place for ""starters"", individuals that want a job to start out life or a young individual. The management team are great and my co workers are excellent. I dont think there is nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers."
good,I first started working there as a MCA (merchandise customer assistant)....I had fun because of my coworkers they were great.
good,"In at 6;30am Check your inventory and equipment. Review your daily work order's and their location's. Get fueled up and be ready for first call. Learned a great deal about Managing Inventory, Punctuality and Customer service. Lead Technician, would sometimes review and report about a qualified assitant performance daily. Following procedures and be punctual. Co-worker's is fair because there is no time Socialize. Most enjoyable part of the Job is when your name is up on the board for Most sales for the day and/or Month."
good,"Typical day at work unloading trucks, i learned how to manage time while unloding trucks, management wasn't so good, co-workers helped out alot, hardest part was first starting."
good,"As far as you reach your quotas, you are rolling. But there is no path to success, you just work everyday."
good,"A typical shift is not bad just go in and do your job. i learned how to work with customers and a rush of customers on a busy day. management was ok. the hardest of the job was to keep up your numbers in memberships and credit card sales. the most enjoyable part of the job was having awesome customers, when you had the chance."
good,"Be prepared to work SWING SHIFTS... some managers are cool. Just a typical work environment, follow the rules though so they won't have to explain them over and over."
good,"When Eddie Lampert bought Sears in 2007, his vision was to make Sears a great place to shop, customers should not be unattended. In the appliance arena, these customers were assailed with salespeople, but in clothing, they were ignored. He bought K-Mart, further dissolving the property."
good,this was a good place to work (1st 2 years) then there was management changes and policy changes (3rd year) that were questionable nor effective
good,Due to layoffs at the time and the supervisor I had. It was a learning experience. It was a good place to work.
good,Worked in a team setting to ensure presentation of the store was maintained. Assisted with moves to re-merchandise different areas. Met a lot of interesting people.
good,"I filled many roles from cashiers to merchandiser to floor associate. It kept working there exciting and I did enjoy my fellow associates, Workplace culture could have been better as the attitude of management works it way down to associates."
good,"Because the company is heading underwater, it feels like there is more of a push to sell. You could be the best tech in the world, but unless you’re selling, your not gonna get any pats on the back. The pay is above average tho, making it somewhat worthwhile"
good,"Depending on which team you were on, some of the team leads were a bit headstrong and made the workload more difficult than it needed to be.Original manager was great at overseeing all departments. Then another person was brought in to co-manage and she was very cold, unkind and stayed in her offive all day."
good,El compañerismo y la unidad dentro del ámbito laboral se diferencia porque solo algunos demuestran su verdadero apoyo y honestidad.
good,Sears use to be a good place to work. Working for the company taught me alot about giving great customer service. The culture of the company was pleasant.
good,"Retail service center, typical as far as scheduling and goal setting, managing automotive mechanics and sales staff. Open 7 days a week, friendly environment."
good,"Merchandising isn't very difficult. Just put things where they go. Talking to customers was fun, there were a lot of different kinds of people. I felt kind of out of place because most of the customers, management and staff spoke Spanish."
good,"Nice people that I worked with. The manager of the store was difficult for me to work with, I didn't complete a job when I first started and he kinda made me feel like I was a looser."
good,This job was very stressful. They made me do tons of stuff that wasn't in my job description and never gave a raise. They also never had enough staff around.
good,"The above statement is a bit of an exaggeration, you can grow within the company however most of the staff that gets promoted are the ones who are friends with management"
good,This is a good job to work just starting out in the workforce or during high school I could not see myself extending a career here. The crew was super nice and friendly.
good,"The job was fairly easy I must say, having experience already in the position. Felt unsafe though while working in the backroom lot of exposed wiring, hanging from the ceiling. My time there was ok the commute was just a pain in the butt. I had to drive from home a hour early."
good,"My typical shift at Sears would begin either from 11am to 4pm or from 5pm to 9pm, with the latter shift being the more common one.  During my time at Sears I learned to close a cash register, how to sell merchandise, and work more efficiently in a team fashion. The hardest part of the job was getting the credit card applications to meet the quota, the most enjoyable part of the job was processing merchandise, stocking shelves and interacting with my coworkers."
good,An average day consisted of just working with customers and helping people around you. The management depends on who you are talking to. The person who made the schedule gave me to many hours for a part time position. Otherwise everything else was ok.
good,Sears have taught me a lot in the years I've served there. I use the word serve'd because it very much felt like the military. They work they're employees very hard with very little respect. The management at the workplace would ask us to perform dangerous tasks that could easily get us injured and many did get injured including myself in the attempt to fulfill their requirements. While the employees I got to work with were amazing I can't say the same for management. I am very much so a worker bee but when it comes to sears I can't say I felt safe or appreciated in the numerous years I have worked there.
good,The people that work with me they where good but the people in charged they was not reliable they did not have good communication with employees they always had a problem with the workers..
good,"The job itself was very simple at first, and as time moved on it became much more hectic. All associates wouldn’t just do one thing. You must know everything. While metrics are primarily drive in all retail stores. It was either hit metrics or the store will close down. In reality there is no hope for this brand any longer."
good,If you are a cashier for softlines they could have you doing truck putting truck away and doing cashier. Sometimes they even have you put signs up for hardlines when you have no clue where anything goes. They will sit there and yell at you for not doing this or that correct and will start taking your hours away if you don't get people to sign up for credit cards. All around if your bored this is a job for you.
good,"not worth the effort, SEARS has everything it needs to succeed unfortunately its management both middle and higher have taken it under because of their own shortsighted greed"
good,The hardest part of the job was getting sales.  I would help the people who wanted an appliance agreement but for those who did not want one or couldn't afford one it was difficult to sell one.
good,"Usually they hire part time employees, no benefits if you are. No work security, their stores are slowly closing. It’s good if it’s a transitional job."
good,Enjoyed my job at times. It paid the bills. When I was relocated to warehouse I enjoyed my duties. I worked in different departments. I think my favorite position was in the parts department
good,"Job pools were overbooked, had to drive all over town, didn't get home till 1 AM at times from repairs, got put on jobs that were severely broken without  competent help."
good,"High Volume of inbound calls"
good,"My employment at sears was disappointing. The main problem with this job was having to use out dated equipment. The company did not invest as much as they needed to for the store I worked at. Most of the equipment was broken or needed to be repaired. Also, management kept making unusual decisions. Other than that it was a relaxing work environment with friendly and helpful team members."
good,"It is a outdoor sales position, you must enjoy sales and prepare to work long hours. Great income for those who does well. You will work from your home."
good,I gained lot of inter personal skills and experiences needed for my career growth. I had fun interacting with my co workers. I loved the work environment.
good,"I started as cashier then when the holidays had gone, I was moved to the floor as Merchandise Assistant. It is ok for now as long as I am still in college. There is a good chance to get a second job out of Sears. Issues about working under Sears is the fact of the Citibank credits and store credit cards provided by Sears. It is a round business and the corporate relies on credits. It is not that bad if there are persuasive associates. There is a small commission by each credit. Then, the second issue is the so called members ( customers/ consumers), most all of them come from Tijuana, so bilingual is a requirement. Around the 80 percent of Sears members are rude people who want everything free. Specially the Tj's. The good part is that it is the only way to keep business. Being nice, polite and reliable is a good chance to succeed. Managers have lack of communication despite they are carrying ratios on their waist. They are ok and  sometimes nice. As every company, there are pro and cons."
good,Unfortunately Sears has now closed all of the Retail Sears Parts Direct Stores within The United States.  A great place to learn how to work with many different types of customers.  Requires computer skills to assist the customers.
good,"Typical day at Sears was taking calls and making sales for customers, troubleshooting items that were already owned by the customer. I learned different system. Workplace  culture was positive."
good,When I worked for sears it was really stressful. Management never cared about how hard you worked they just see you as a money sign. All they want you to do is pitch for credit and if you don't they lower your hours even though its clear they you've been working hard to get credit. Hours were horrible and I've witnessed at least 5 store managers come and go.
good,With a bunch of locations closing it's not desirable to work there. Plus they will not relocate you. And there is no help finding a new job no matter how long you've been there
good,"If you could not make their required amount of credit card app. they would start to cut back your hours and not tell you why. The mangers there were not willing to help if the store started to get busy. They would also keep you past store closing time to clean up, even if it wasn't your section."
good,"Loved working in the jewelry loved the customers. I finally had to leave because of the pay i was a manager and was only making 8"
good,"Sears basically sucks , everyone is way to overly competitive over credit applications, management is lazy and rude to their employees. Some employees do absolutely NOTHING while other employees have to do all THEIR assigned work when theyre only supposed to be doing one thing."
good,era un ambiente de trabajo estresante ya que hacia falta mas administracion y control en los procesos
good,"A typical day at work was long and rough. The management did not help and did not give any guidance. The only training received was from other employees, the management and higher staffing did not give any assistance.  All the rough work was put off for the evening staff to do and the management never did anything about it."
good,"Sears is a starter job.  The company is on verge of bankruptcy, so employment here should not be considered a career path, but more of a starter job to get into the workforce."
good,"Slow days, horrible attitudes by surrounding experiences associates. The managers are always on the go, so most of your job is self taught, unless you meet a nice associate."
good,"Sears was not a good place to work. It was probably due mostly due to the management at that store. Other stores may have had a better management, I can only comment on the store I worked at."
good,Aucun avis n'a été donné pour cet emploi. Merci...
good,"Loved my job.   Wanted more hours.   Loved assisted customers, but wanted more training on products.    Commission gave you a great incentive, and helping customers as well."
good,Pushed to sell sears credit cards. I was good at that which was by luck because they didnt teach well. Meetings were often but didnt say too much. certain people were favored way more than others.
good,"The company and location that I am in, was hard."
good,"Not an organized place to work, just look at the outcome (closed)."
good,"When I worked with Sears off and on from 1964 until 1969, I enjoyed working there. "
good,"Sears offered me at the most 6 hours a week and they pay was low. I haven’t seen a check more than $70, so what was the point of wasting my time there when other opportunities are out there."
good,I loved the type of job I was doing but was very unhappy with some of the staff I had to work with. They used very bad language around customers which was embarrassing to me and I reported to management but nothing done so I quit
good,I loved the job but the managers were to demanding. I worked from home. Too much work for the pay. Too many conference calls in one day and not allowing enough time to get the work done.
good,I left the company because sales were slow. The constant announcements of stores closing really effected our store and customers were not coming in. Management was always hassling us to call our leads and when we did people said they bought online or they did not like our prices.
good,"No comment wasn't my best experienced, too many managers, each manager had a different m.O. And had different expectations, and this caused confusion."
good,"No room for advancement, management does not care about their employees. The only positive is that you'll make friends with your fellow coworkers, only because you're all fed up with your bosses and the failing company."
good,"The most important (my most enjoyable) part of the job was meeting new customers every day interacting with them and being able to attend to their needs. At times the store may become extremely busy but its important to remain focused. As a Merchandising & pricing Associate, my job was mostly on the floor. I had to ensure the merchandises are on the floor as soon as they arrive, I had to ensure they are neatly organized and in place and accessible to customers."
good,The shifts and work weeks were very inconsistent. I couldn't advance in that work place. The management hardly paid attention. They were not flexible with my schooling.
good,It was difficult to advance at sears. low pay and low hours. great temporary part time job for extra cash. would not recommend sears for a career field
good,I feel Sears was a poorly managed company. The managers were not engaged with their staff and therefore caused high turn over in staffing. It was very challenging environment.
good,"Pleasant people to work with , I knew my job very well and learned many new things over the years . I must admit there was no raises for many years , and no room to move forward ."
good,"I was employed for a short time not there long enough to get the joust of things. People were great to work with, however the company had went into receivership"
good,Buena empresa para tener experiencia y contratacion inmediata
good,"Very fast paced environment, extremely cut-throat, manager will micro-manage you until you've earned at least 6 months of work experience at Sears. If you like extremely long hours with alot of travel time, this job is for you."
good,"depending on who you're working with its either torture or just bearable, but all decent competent co workers quickly move on to better carrers leaving you in the lurches mostly working with the dregs, that is when they even bother to show up for their shifts"
good,Sears has the ability to change your schedule whenever they want to. They are going bankrupt so you will only get a day or two a week. Wouldn't recommend working here
good,"when I first got hired I was trained for about 20 mins  total on how to use the register . No knowledge of doing any online shopping with the customers on the store computers , no knowledge on how to sign customers up for sears rewards , no knowledge on how to do returns and exchanges ,all I knew was cash register basics and how to fold clothes properly .  It’s a great short term job. I wouldn’t consider making it a long run career though."
good,Wonderful people arranging the deck chairs as the music plays. A once great company slowly slipping into oblivion.  Had the potential for recovery.. Hopefully it will rise from its' ashes.
good,"I learned a lot here, they use a laptop that connects to a support center and downloads service updates and manuals for the Technician to be able to work on any appliance that Sears services, Technical and mechanical.  As a Service Tech you have to you have to watch your driving habits because to the management at Sears this is more important than your work experience. If you get 3 call ins to the number on your van in an 18 month period, whether you think you are innocent or not, you will be fired just because you had 3 call ins"
good,"fun environment but managers would not help trained or help when you needed family time, would not recommend working their unless you needed little less than 20 hours!"
good,Une journée toujours bien remplie car au début de journée ont reçoit une remorque de 53' à vider toujours dans un temps records car tant que là marchandises n'est pas sur le plancher elle n'est pas vendues.La vitesse et le bon travail précis mais toujours avec sécurité .Le froid l'hiver était un peu irritant à la réception .Un travail d'équipe avec notre groupe qui était devenue une petite famille pour chaque personne nous étions à l'écoute.
good,"I was a cashier. Responsible for ringing up items, put clothing back where it belongs, cashiering, customer service. You have to be very patient and productive."
good,didnt really like the job it wasnt really what I wanted to do and I didnt really get paid alot for the amount of work we did it was also temporary though
good,"Worked in Lawn and Garden/Fitness/Tools on commission, commission rates are poor, management disconnected and corporate culture as a whole uncaring about entry level positions."
good,"It was definitely a job that you must love what you do, it is rewarding to see the out come of your work, see the smile on your clients face.To know that your work is going to be in someone's family for many years, is the best feeling."
good,Always something new to do daily and always ensuring that tasks where done in a daily basis. Enjoyed working with a team and always coming up with new ideas to help sales and ensure that we makes our store look the best.
good,It a good pay but it alot heavy lift with your ✋ and fast moving warehouse and great people to with some great manager to work for and fun place to great pay
good,"No advancement, no job security, little pay, no compensation. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. It's too much stress since they're always looking for sales."
good,No opportunity for career advancement or raises. Sears is closing several stores across the country and I feel it is just a matter of time for the Muncie location to be added to that list.
good,"I like the work at sears, but there is no enough hours or discount for associate. "
good,I liked working there during the summer months because of the additional training you received to promote new lawn and garden products. The store I worked at is closing so there is no need to comment anything else at this point.
good,"Between holidays, there is a lot of standing around to do. You get employee discounts, but there are special stipulations surrounding discounts. More of a minimum wage job. You're on your feet close to the entire length your shift. Good customer service and patience are required."
good,"I enjoyed my job however I was not receiving the pay, hours or benefits I needed as an adult with full time bills and household needs. The only actual aspect of the daily job requirements I did not like was the demand to ""push"" the credit cards"
good,"Very fast paced environment, training vs hands on performance were not totally relatable. High demands and expectations from management every moment to meet company standards and customer's needs."
good,"they want you to sell as many credit cards as possible. no consideration for customers or their credit score whatsoever. "
good,There was often only a couple customers per night.I wasn't allowed to read or leave my post and rarely got my breaks. And there wasn't very much to clean so i would dust everything I possibly could.
good,The work was easy and the hours were good for the most part. I needed a part-time job after I got out of surgery and it was a good place to work to get back on my feet.
good,Learned a lot from some great people. The company needs to tend to their assets and experienced senior staff. I received invaluable work experience and skills.
good,if you need money I mean its nice but not something id do forever. the pay isn't to great and they can give you crazy hours . its a good starter job for people that just need something under their belt .
good,"•	Meet quotas by creating plans and utilizing strategies that always lead to achievement and growth of business goals in sales and service. "
good,Enjoyed my specific job. I worked early mornings or very late nights into mornings taking care of the visual and pricing needs of the store. I had a great group of people working with me.
good,Dealing with some of the employees was sometimes difficult because there was not much supervision in the office which made your job much harder. The job itself was too much for one person.
good,It is Sears and there really is no other explanation unless you work there. Every ones opinion of the company is their own. There are some good people and few good management.
good,"It was a interesting job, it was fun for the most part but there was not very many areas for growth within the sears store I was at, they knew who they wanted to promote or they would always hire somebody else from the outside."
good,Upper management is the worst imaginable. Outlandish goals for making people sign up for the credit cards and you get punished if you don’t meet them.
good,"Great hard working associates dedicated to a company. Learned about various aspects of running a business. "
good,"Company, was once a great company.  The company could not keep up with modern day times and internet sales and unfortunetely the company is closing.  The companies CEO was not familair with retail business and did not have the right people in the right places."
good,working for sears call center was boring and no one hardly did their job because you were calling people trying to sell stuff to them that they more often then none don't need.
good,"Nice people to work with but the hours per week were terrible, barely paying for anything and because it was commission you can't make any sales either."
good,"A typical day at sears was busy and a fast place to work. I learned how to become a supervisor and direct the cashiers on what to do. Management was not always on the same page,  a lot of back and forth. Sears was great  with diversity. They gave any and everyone a chance. The most hardest part of being a supervisor at sears was managing people other than I am. The most enjoyable part of sears was the front in were always on one page."
good,"they took away our discounts, reduced hours, merged positions together to the point where if one person calls out. The whole store would be behind. The stress load is not worth staying for."
good,"I worked at Sears-Holdings and really enjoyed it, but my department was transferred to India, so I was forced to do customer support work, involving taking inbound calls all day and I didn't want to do that.  So I left my job and drew unemployment for a while.  Now doing part-time work through AARP Senior Employment Agency and am assigned to work at Habitat for Humanity on East Euclid, Des Moines.  It is a part-time job and work no more than 18 hours a week. I clean customer donations like light fixtures and ceiling fans and get them ready for Restore, where these clean, like new donations are sold."
good,Working for sears was ok and all however they are slowly closing down. I worked in a store that was laid back and not much would go on during the day. Night time was a little more busy then your day time. All and all it wad a relaxed place.
good,"The employees were very, bland when it came to the curtesy. They were really nice people if you talked to them 1 on 1 but they could get somewhat mean, when it came to a group."
good,"I love the people I worked with. The job was a little challenging at times, with upset customers. But I did love setting up service calls and ordering parts."
good,"A typical day at work is ringing customers out, making sure they find what they need. I learned if your numbers are low you're not useful, laid back environment, the management was laid-back, there was no hard part of the job."
good,"Not enough associates scheduled to realistically perform job"
good,Honestly you're going to love working there at first. But then once you see the job for what it really is you're gonna wanna run. The employees are lazy they don't want to work they don't come to work theyre not driven they're messy. It's just a hot mess working for this company.
good,Sears is all about the business.  Do not care about their employees unless you are in upper management.  No room for growth unless you are like by upper management.
good,I will begin with saying I remember very little of this job. I unloaded truck and loaded merchandise into member's vehicles. I couldn't name my manager - but I remember him having very little presence in my area.
good,"i did not enjoy working there, i could never advance there, never received any benefits or annual raises. honestly, i enjoyed my fellow employees but the company did not care about the employees so much."
good,The position I was offered had no ability to become full-time. The training was good but needed to be longer. The Managment were great people to work for and very helpful.
good,I never received a raise and then the company took away our discounts. They also took away my ability to make more money by restructuring the Credit Card rewards.  I requested time to go to a Funeral and was denied. I needed time off to take care of my Father so instead of doing a family leave act I asked for my vacation. They denied it! So I quit. Family comes first!
good,"I worked for Sears for nearly four years.  The pay is absolutely awful and their pay raise system is one of the worst I've ever seen.  In the nearly four years I worked for them I received one raise that brought my pay from 7.25(the minimum wage) to 7.58.  This wasn't because of poor performance - they simply didn't hand out raises.  I was one of two other people in the whole front half of the store that received raises during this period.  They're not very picky about who they hire so it was common to have people who were prone to drama and laziness/theft working there - although many didn't work there for long.  In fact, with both regular associates and management there was a lot of turnover (I had a large number of managers come and go while I worked there).  I enjoyed the people I worked with for the first couple of years, but overall the company is very corporate in spirit and showed very little care for the average worker.  I carried out the workload of several people yet received poor pay and no benefits for it."
good,Sales and compensation do not go hand in hand.  Of all the hardwork put in for this position went un-noticed and had to make decision of seeking other employment.
good,Good job for recent high school grads. Not really a job you need if you are trying to pay the bills. Nice people that work there. Sometimes crazy metrics that you have to meet. I hated begging people to fill out the credit card app.
good,"Typical call center environment  - future  of company uncertain, observed that management  is jumping ship. You have seen all of the news articles  about store closings."
good,Never no help at all nobody never came to work an no hours...but they people friendly nice store and the fact that it's basics on  Commission so u get paid minimum wage..
good,"Sears was a great learning experience as it was one of my first retail jobs. I started working there in the beginning of holiday season and it was very demanding and received many hours. I quit because it was interfering with my high school exams at the time. I felt that some of the management were rude to student employees. The one thing i would change is i would update how they post weekly schedules as it was on a bulletin board in the staff room and not online so if you did not have any weekend shifts or anybodys number you would not know if you were scheduled to work the following monday. Also, they do not answer their phones at all"
good,"I was given the opportunity to show what I had as a salesperson, more here than any other place I've worked for. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers were a delight"
good,Not a positve experience. Sears has lost a lot of ground as a manager you would do the work of 5 people and there is no compassion from the regional team
good,Everyday was a challenge making sure customers received the right parts for their DIY products. Like Christmas when new merchandise arrived. Would have stayed if company were stronger financially.
good,"slow workplace due to mall shutting down, sales were minimal so salary was low. to advance you had to leave the store and go to another one, frustrating."
good,"A company that is struggling and too many top heavy executives that are over compensated, the largest drain of cashflow.  The cuts over the years has put the DC in peril and no investment in new technology that now is too late to recover in the competitive environment of the online retailer."
good,Overall good job just wish I had gotten More hours. The managers are there to help you and will pull you aside to speak with you if needed. Good environment
good,"Honestly despite it being a good place to work, I'd have to say that the management team is very unprofessional. Several times I called for cash or needing a drop and no one came for thirty minutes even though I called every department. Managers wouldn't show up for interviews, etc. Very unprofessional company. No wonders they're going out of business. "
good,"•	Protected company assets through activities in safety, inventory recovery and internal/external theft."
good,"Sears is a great store to shop. However the  overall management leaves a lot to be desired especially concerning how the workers are treated. I had a great time because my boss was fun, however the same could not be said for everyone."
good,"I love working some of the people there, they have a great staff but lack of leadership. Every time I asked a question I got different answers from different Team Leaders."
good,"A normal day was on PTZ cameras finding and stopping theft. "
good,"Minimum pay for maximum effort, little in the way of future job prospects.  Being forced through this survey is aggravating.  I am trying to find work, not answer a bunch of silly questions."
good,"With the consistent org changes over the last few years, it is a very unsure and unstable environment for many employees. No more associate discount unless you want points back on a Shop you way credit card purchase.  The overall employee excitement and moral is missing.  The work load for everyone is double with triple the descrease in headcount."
good,While working at Sears a lot of the managers were never available to assist employees or customers. The pay is horrible for the work that is asked to do.
good,job was fun relaxed place to work it was easy to do your job management could have been better customers were fun to work with nice having regulars who came back to you for there needs
good,"-A typical work day requires you to sign up at least three people for credit cards,your hours are dependent on the amount of people you signed up for credit cards.. "
good,Solamente comision no hay sueldo base .2hrs comida
good,"Great people to work with but due to a lack or managerial skills it was a nightmare to work there. Schedules were never consistent, lack of training on everything."
good,Ienjoyed working at sears I loved working with people I learn how to be a cashier the only thing I didn't like was that they couldn't give me more hours
good,Good place for individuals that wish to expand their retail skills in all forms wether it be a cashier or taking care of the floor and making sure it's in good condition.
good,"working for Sears was good.  Able to learn quite a bit, but compensation was not.  wage increase hadn't ocurred in 10 years.  Most enjoyable was the co workers."
good,Having been employed by this corporation has been an experience as well as a learning hurtle. Being able to grow as a leader with each promotion I obtained. While having to go through hurtles with little to no support from upper management.
good,This was a good place to work and get started in learning how to sell. However it was a terribly run organization that is somehow holding on to the few stores that it has left
good,Sears provides a place where you can meet people all over the state. You are called to fix a problem at a customer's home. The customers show great appreciation for the work you do. There is a lot of driving.
good,"Lots of turn over due to low wage offers to employees"
good,This is a bad company to work for. they do not pay well at all. You have room to grow but the pay sucks. Now its a great company to work for if you wanna buy stuff you like for your discounts.
good,Para que una empresa funcione al 100% tiene que a ver mucha preparación para los empleados empezando por directivos y la gente que le sigue hacia  abajo tener mejor en cuenta que es liderazgo plantación negación análisis autogestión y sobre todo en una empresa ho hay jefes son líderes.
good,"Consult w customers regarding home appliances. schedule delivery, installation, and service. "
good,"While working there, I enjoyed the team I was employed with but the management could have been a lot better. Yelling at associates in front of customers, cussing at them, etc. was definitely not the best environment. However, they taught well with their computers as well as hands on training."
good,I would not work for Sears again. Sears seems to be a company that is on the decline. Most employees seem unhappy. They work you just enough so they don't have to give you benefits. I had to supplement my income by working two other part time jobs.
good,"Good experience in retail management. Flexibility in using several management skills and learning new ways to market and manage the business. Work closely with sales team and customer to provide stellar service. Corporation can be difficult to work with at times and affects customer service provided by store associates. Overall, a good stepping stone position."
good,"Overall my experience at Sear was subpar. I liked the team that I was on and what I was doing but  I personally did not agree with how thing were run. "
good,Very overworked an unappreciated. Very little on the job training. Tools to complete the job successfully aren't provided. Morale progressively is worse year over year.
good,"The people you work with become your best friends, and some of the Managers are great people and very helpful. Overall the business is dying and there is no room for advancing in the company. Their equipment is outdated and the company is failing."
good,Retail is always difficult but all the employees were fun and optimistic during the work day. Job was demanding and stressful at times.
good,"The managers are really good with working around everyone's schedule and it's a fun place to work at. Sears does care about its customers but needs to update the equipments to make the job easier for employees. In overall, Sears is a good place to work."
good,"My first day of work was on Black Friday, boy was it hectic! People all over the place, that's when I knew it would be like that all throughout the holidays since that's what I initially got hired for. Holidays past and I was offered a regular position, which I accepted but ultimately ended up leaving because of personal reasons. Overall, it is a good place to work if you DON'T have children and DON'T plan to work here forever."
good,Managers often cut hours and would give four hours a week and that was when i was making credit. We couldn't check how many applications were going through. Shady company
good,"Only worked there for about 5 months but,overall not a place i would want to work for  very long , didn't like it the boss would always leave for coffee or whatever at the busiest time of the day leaving you swamped"
good,"Management is very slow at posting the next week's schedule....it's usually posted the day before it's to start.   "
good,"Management was poor at the Sears I worked for. We had two Managers at the time I had put in my two weeks. The entire time I worked there, 3 managers were hired and they also quit. I was given the opportunity to move up to a management position, but it was given away to someone else right in front of me. I was very over qualified for every management position in the store, but they made poor choices that made the store look bad to corporate, which Management put it off on the employees, not themselves. Sears in Paris TX can be a great place to work, if the management is dealt with."
good,"Sears is in deep financial trouble.  Knowing this puts pressure on all employees.  Lower management is very particular about very specific numbers in Sear's' reward programs and master cards.  If you are unable to be persuasive to customers to enroll in rewards or credit cards, this is not the job for you.  Overall Sears is not a creative or fun environment and I have personally not seen advancement opportunities within the company."
good,Sears was one of the worst places I have ever worked from management to scheduling. A lot of extra work off the clock. Spent more time having meetings about the union vote and things such as belt color and shoe colors.
good,"Typical day involved attending training on product architecture,doing environment setup,understanding business concepts and requirements ,convert them to technical designs and doing coding and unit testing."
good,"This was a great company to work with for the most part.  Typical retail work schedule, long hours, weekends and holidays.  Management is key to a successful run store, morale, and overall environment."
good,"Depending on where you work; cashier, softlines (clothing and shoes), hardlines (appliances, tools, kitchen hardware), or in the back pulling orders and unloading truck it can be a job that requires A Lot of energy."
good,"low pay"
good,Easy to switch positions. But you don't necessarily get the training you'd need for it. Managers had attitudes. I was left to do a lot of my managers job when she decided she didn't want to finish. And often got scolded when I didn't know what to do. Store managers changed often. More than sales associates. If there was no one to do a job in a different department you were expected to do it. Even if you had no idea. I was often told to be a cashier when I worked in mattresses because someone who worked in clothes would have called in. They want you to do a lot of work for minimum wage.
good,My time at sears was not a pleasant one. Bad management and team memebers made it hard to do almost anything while on the job.
good,Sears retail and appliances family friendly atmosphere selling anything from clothes to washing machines. We unload trucks process merchandise locate stockroom and retrieve online orders
good,"I was with Sears for 3 years, I had fun and not fun at the same time. The only great thing about this place were my coworkers. They were the only ones that kept me going to work. The management changes every few months, although the holidays can be fun and hectic at the same time. If you want to start a job, I can say retail is the place to go, but not to start a career."
good,"Long hours, alot of driving, most of the customers were nice. The job was very challenging, but I liked that. However I was a technician and they were more focused on me selling than they were about the job I was doing as a tech. Which is why I no longer work there."
good,"Typical day is either managing communications at the desk or touring stores for compliance. Many contacts thru email, voice mail, land line or mobile. Crisp and upbeat with lots of energy to keep things moving. New contracts or amendments always on the burner. Fast paced and always in touch with my vendors, outreach affiliations or media partners."
good,Days as a cashier was okay when i first started i have a supervisor that would push us in an a good way to get people to join our rewards program but after a while the upper management would put too much pressure on the regular management it became really hard to want to show up to work everyday i had to. the hardest part was to push people to apply for credit cards.
good,They push so many different metrics into the Managers & if they can't make their team perform every month above company goal then you will be finding a new job real quick like. Your always stressed out about al the different metrics your trying to keep up & then on top of that you always gotta remember you could be their today & gone tomorrow with out a blink doesn't matter how good you are at your job!
good,"The company is going through a tough time and there is a very limited number of opportunities. "
good,"Maintain, repalir, overhaul, adjust install and check a variety of equipment; read and understand electrical schematics, manuals and other information."
good,"I worked for over 25 years in Management"
good,"Opening cash registers and preparing for opening. Making sure I am stocked with bags and other items needed for the day."
good,"Once the merger with Kmart happened, the overall quality of merchandise went down. "
good,"Push credit cards...that's all they wanted you to do.  2-4 dollars an application. "
good,If you don't have too many bills or outside obligations this is great for a start or extra money. But with the low hours it is difficult to navigate life with this particular job.
good,"sears is a great company to work for however its mostly for college students. Management sucks they go by preferences of who they like and give them more hours than other workers who are really putting in hard work. Apart from this,  i had a great experience there with customers and other co workers."
good,Was a fun place to work with great people. Management changed and was overly strict and didn't do things with the associates. The store manager is fake would tell you one thing then tell someone else something different behind your back. The store manager has poor customer service skills as well
good,"Management Team,  worked cohesively together. Definitive and consistent direction/communication with the GM at that time was lacking. Employee survey of satisfaction for whole store 43% out of 100%."
good,Sears is a dinosaur in Today's age. They are unable to compete with the cheaper alternatives and the management does not seem to care. The owner only cares about his bottom line thus making working for them a terrible decision.
good,"My day is always different; never boring and never the same.  I always enjoy working at Sears.  The people are great, the employees are even better."
good,"Normal work day was having shift meetings and opening up store doors and giving the day before recap of how we did on sales,and what our goal was for the day."
good,"Its a good company. Enjoyed working there. But still few employees because they have few hours to give. Make sure you work hard, if you do, you will love working there, when you do your best, they give you longer hours."
good,For starters it's a good place to work at if your just looking for a part time. It's very complicated to work and communicate with coworkers. management is not so good..
good,"mon avis pour cette  compagnie "
good,"I was always on time. Really enjoyed receiving all the store associates in the morning. As well as saying goodbye at closing time.  Every day was different as customers and associates made your day. Had a lot of work to be done and I prioritized. Every coaching and observation was done on time.  Schedules and goals were mentioned every day. Presentation standards was done daily."
good,"I worked at Sears for about eight months. During that time, I was trained to do several different jobs and expected to be multiple people all the time."
good,"I was there for five months and all the other employees were great people. Most of them walked out though because of the management, who for the most part stayed in the office while all the workload was put onto the employees."
good,Good company to work for it's just some of the leadership is hard to work with when they do not support you and talk ugly to you in public nobody should be treated like that. I have always had great work experiences until lately for about the past 5 years under this district manager that has absolutely no work ethic manners.
good,not a bad place to work to start your first job.  But the pay is not worth it and you have no chance for a raise unless you move up which is hard to do.  The co workers you work with are great.  it makes the day go by faster.  it is a typical retail job where they push you to meet numbers.
good,This job had its ups and downs. I started as a seasonal employee and within a year was the manager. I enjoyed the photography and the energy needed during the seasonal peaks. The district management was regrettably not what I would consider a bonus to the company. I would've stayed with Sears portrait studio if the benefits and raises were better.
good,"I have worked for this company on two separate occasions and was paid more for the first four years than when they asked me to come back to work.  We had moved to Maryland because of my wife's job."
good,A typical day at  work varied. There are times when there were not very many customers. Cleaning and maintaining safe environment was easy.  There were days where we were extremely busy those were the most enjoyable. We were assisting customers in making the shopping experience as satisfactory as possible while meeting their individual needs.
good,The management stressed the cashiers out way too much to get the numbers they feel is good enough. The management cant get good numbers but expects the employees to.
good,"In a business where sales are what should drive a company, Sears is more worried about mad up metrics and items that do not matter. You can have great sales for the day but if you don't log how many people you talked to that day you are ridiculed. For a company with the name and time in the business it is pretty sad to see just how bad the company has taken a dive and it is only a matter of time until it has to close its doors."
good,"Day shift left night shift with all the cleaning. "
good,Sears has a reputation of viewing others as leaders and they're trying to catch up. They consider Walmart and Amazon as the retail front runners and fail to facilitate out of the box thinking.
good,"this place is okay to work, as far as not to much work to do with low pay. hours are good as well as work type but no advancement opportunity."
good,Sears is a good place to work but they don't give raises unless you manage to get a Lead position. Great family environment and generally awesome people to work with.
good,"Hard to move up in the company when they will only interview those that they already intend to give the promotion to.  I understand that most companies already have an idea of who they want when they start looking for a new manager.  But, I feel they should still conduct interviews for those wishing to advance so those individuals have a chance to show others what they bring to the company."
good,"As a student in school, Sears was a good job to work at because it accommodated your school schedule. The place needs more management skills and more growth opportunities."
good,"Pendulum  swings more to sales of contracts more than service.  Your life is consumed in the job operations. Your home becomes a warehouse. "
good,Clock in check fitting room. return item back to the sales floor. ensure that the sales floor is clean. Assist members in locating items. Cashing out members. Everyday is a learning experience. I enjoy meeting new people. I get along with all co-workers. There's really no hard part. The most enjoyable part is customer satisfaction.Knowing I provided them with there needs.
good,"The ONLY thing that kept me at sears for as long as I was.. THE other associates and some of the management staff. the associates are always wiling to help each other although  the company set them up to  be overly competive. also if sears makes an error often the sales person takes the ""ding"" in the way of lost commission even if its the fault of the call center or the delivery or installation team,"
good,"come in at 8:45 and count cash "
good,My day consists of working with clients and representatives to make appointments for home improvements such as a kitchen remodel.  I learned a lot about a lot of products for the home.  I learned to qualify my customers.  Management changed all the time.  There was little consistency with leadership.  The hardest part was to just do your job and not get involved with the drama around you.  The most enjoyable part was getting paid to talk on the phone.
good,"I enjoyed working for Sear, how ever they were unpredictable when it came to keeping there employees at 40 hours a week. Unfortunately those conditions are not exceptable when you are supporting a family."
good,"Se esta trabajando por una cultura laboral donde los empleados tienen actividades de inclusion donde se promueven valores como la familia, el deporte, el compañerismo."
good,"The company needs a great deal of connection to the real world.  The salary scale is out dated.  They have chosen to stop providing pay increases period.  The company has lost touch with working members of the company.  They are extremely top heavy so there is no room for advancement with the company.  The turn over rate for the company is out of control, due to the pay rate and no raises."
good,A typical work day was stressful. Management didn't care about customers or employees. Customers were always upset about the quality of service. Extremely difficult to make career advances.
good,"Sears is a dying company teetering on the brink of closure. Having already announced the closure of 128 stores in the country with more to follow, the CEO of Sears Holdings Corporation is desperately trying to turn a profit, something that hasn't happened in nearly 15 years. Like most Sears stores across the country management changes hands often, pay is low, raises are non-existent, hours are minimal, and employees spend more time dealing with disgruntled customers than providing a positively memorable customer experience."
good,"great learning opportunity, great place to work. great products and associates. managers were not as nice as they should be."
good,"Stressful"
good,"always busy Hardly have time for lunch, buy I love most of my coworkers.  My co-workers are the main reason I come to work.  Turn over rate is terrible"
good,"Worked there when it was K-mart and was wonderful with all the managers I worked with before they switched things over to Sears Grand, different managers that didn't know what they were doing or wouldn't allow schedule change as they give the new person the schedule you were wanting, so glad I got out of there when I did and I wasn't surprised when it shut down do to lack of customers since they changed the name and product."
good,"Sears, is worried about one thing, money. They fail at customer service, and maintaining technicians. Some of the programs in which they use are rubbish and fail to provide efficient routes."
good,Worked from electronics then moved to Appliances. Learned how to handle people who aren't to happy a lot. Learned to keep them from going crazy
good,To be understanding as a team  work within guidelines.looking for a suiteable position hard work no good pay . very long hours to be done with 1 employee
good,The people who I worked with were by far the greatest part of the job. 99% of them were super awesome and enjoyable to be around.
good,"Go into work, clock in, resolve customer issues from other employee screw ups, try to meet ridiculous daily sales goals, all while getting harped at by management to clean designated areas shortly before their bosses come in for a visit."
good,"General work environment that is in need of a refreshing. Something new and fresh to liven things. Open minds from the management would really help. Also more effort to find out just what hidden treasures lie within the employees who are right under your nose. Great apparel selections and home goods. Its not so bad. However, don't be afraid to shine and demand that your great ideas and your wonderful potential is recognized and acknowledged."
good,"Very customer centric work environment"
good,"Responsible for maintaining the cash register. I would provide excellent customer service, while simultaneously trying to convince customers to open a credit card with us."
good,I would work trying to get sales. I learned to be proactive. Management was at times unorganized but tried to make it seem that they are. Some co-workers was very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping my sales when outside forces beyond my control affects them. Example being the delivery services not shipping the item on time and customer wants to change their mind about it. The most enjoyable part of the job was finalizing a sale for a customer and seeing how happy they are to get the product that they want.
good,"I was with this company for 22 years and started off making $5.65 and ended a salary of $45,000. Fast paste and productive place to work. I worked at this job for 22 years."
good,Tough place to work. Not alot of time outside of work given the retail hours (nights and weekends.) Very little feedback from upper mgmt on the direction the company was going.
good,"Skewed values, Far too much focus on their metrics (Credit applications per month, reward program enrollment, base to bonus conversion)."
good,"Sears was by far the worst employment experience i have ever had. Working in the backroom i understand there are certain requirements to full fill on a daily basis, but sometimes the work that was asked was way over my pay grade."
good,"Was in the company for roughly 2 and a half years. Really impatient management, taxing hours and little compensation benefits. Promotion based solely on personal preference instead of merits, gossip hub and a major issue with management who have lost belief in the company itself. All employees shared a sense of ""Doom"" that is soon approaching viewpoint on Sears as a whole."
good,There is not much room for growth however this is a great place to work as a first job to gain experience. A few of the top departments have dissolved and many people were demoted.
good,"Distributed and picked scanned assignments according to a production, performed general warehouse duties in other departments when needed."
good,"Sears is a very stressful company to work for because it values metrics over people (includes employees and members).  As a consultative sales associate, you are expected to meet unrealistic metrics goals (BOT) with ipads and SNCs that are unreliable; acquire emails for Loyalty metric with an increasing paranoid population of people who do not want to give it out; and get people to sign up for Sears credit cards, in a world that is watching its credit score.  Sears does not want to hear that its members have the right to say ""no"" and that that should be respected.  Additionally, its managers need either more training (and be able to better train its employees working at the cashier/MCA level) or Sears just needs to be selective about who it hires as managers.  Too many associates at Sears are expected to know things they were never trained about, creating a very chaotic and stressful work environment for its associates and members!"
good,"Decent for a minimum wage job, not   a lot of opportunity for advancement. employer is flexible with scheduling, great for students to balance work and school."
good,"Schedules were flexible, they didn't care about the hours you worked as long as you got your job done. It was very common to be taken off one project and put on another, causing you to re-prioritize your schedule and turn on a dime. I learned a lot about content design and development. I have made great friendships in my time. The most difficult part of the job was the constant change of direction, your priorities could change from day to day. I was also a member of the planning team for our yearly convention. I enjoyed that the most."
good,Sears wants you to give customer service  but they don't want you to save the customer money.?! better shopping there than working there. Sears is  always abought the dfsssssssss
good,"Sears in not a bad company to work for if you need money. The benefits and 401 options are terrible or I should say the lack there of. There is no paid vacation and no one gets raises, maybe the CEO. Hard to move up in the company because the stores are afraid of change. Don't even get me started on the bathrooms! The people.. well lets not talk about the people. Your coworkers will most likely be barbaric cave dwellers. You might be able to find one or two cool people to call friends. Its all about the dental chicks!"
good,"Each day consisted of contacting member's in regards to a bounced check or because another company sent them to collections. I would work to contact as many members as I could each day and set them on payments plans. Some of the days were more difficult than others because a lot of the time members would not call back. Or, they would just advise they have no money and to let it go on their credit. Each day we tried to maintain a goal to meet. Management was very friendly and helped as much as needed."
good,Typical retail position with low staff. The hours are flexible if you need a part time. Employees are very nice and easy to get a long with.
good,"For the little time that I was there it was an overall good experience and learned from peers new skills to add to my list.  Very few employees, which made for a totally different experience from the corporate world."
good,Moved through 5 locations and 8 DMs and improved each location that I managed - but still never had much/any opportunity for advancement
good,"My colleagues from specialty fitness were wonderful, we spanned across the states from a total of 62 Sears Specialty Fitness stores. The culture of Sears however has decreased in quality resulting in many mid-level managers to move on in the search of job security."
good,"A typical day at work I would come in make sure everything's in order, and wait for customers to serve if I  found everything to be in order. I learned how to be a cashier. I had issues with management as I was hired as a part time employee, I was informed that i would be full-time for the first week of employment and part-time afterwards  however my manager continued to schedule me for full time hours despite this. Another issue I had was that a largely determining factor on whether I would be continue to be employed was based on sears credit card sales, a factor largely out of the control of a cashier   there was no acknowledgement of whether you had someone who desired a sears credit card, but was not approved, nor was there acknowledgement when 90% of your customers already had sears card and therefore you could not sell to them, this I would say was the hardest/most stressful part of the job."
good,well i just couldnt work there it seemed like they didnt know what they were doing i stayed as long i could they would always write the wrong thing down and we would have to go back over it and fix it
good,the business of this store was that they did not really care too much f what was going on with employees or customers. with the employee they let some of them do whatever they want and not say anything to them. but with the customers they did not pay any attention to them some of the time. management stinked and very unprofessional when it came to hiring new people.
good,The work was monotonous and not what I expected. I folded clothes all day long and soon found out it was not the place for me.
good,Managing a multi million dollar store. Following all of the company initiatives and ensuring maximum probability.
good,All I have to say about work life in Sears is that it's a good company but they need to screen their management candidates better. The decisions they've made over the past few years have brought the company to its knees. I have worked as a customer service/sales associate for almost 10 years and instead of growing as a profesional I have been getting pay cuts. I honestly don't know what the future holds for Sears Holding in Puerto Rico but if they keep making bad decisions it's gonna cost them in the long run. A typical day at work is stressful to say the least.
good,"Working at SEARS is a fast paced high pressure environment. During my time with this business I have learned the importance of people skills and how they affect retention and success of a department. Management of my team is a school of learning in social psychology patience and improvement. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the level of recruitment necessary to meet requirements of the business. I enjoy the ability to speak to many different people all the time, and solving problems."
good,"I worked here for a good amount of time as a Hardlines Merchandiser in Electronics at Kmart (Sears Holdings Inc). The work area was very clean and items were organized well at my station. Co-workers were always friendly as it seems the company hires quite a few teenage girls, I fit right in! Training was thorough and co-workers helped one another out all the time. I worked in electronics as their only electronics associate up to 7 hours a day, while maintaining inventory, conducting audits on Mondays and Wednesdays, performing replenishment in the evenings and re-stocking on receiving days. I processed online orders and kept inventory, managing the automotive, housewares, stationary and appliances department. It's a lot for one person to handle in addition to carrying out typical customer purchases, so I learned to always be on my feet! Muscle is also required to carry televisions ranging up to 60"". Management was, however, a problem. The Assistant Managers were wonderful, but the store manager was not. He was unprofessional, would use profanities towards the employees and has had formal complaints filed against him. Many schedules were changed last minute on multiple occasions, causing employees to come in for work when they were not scheduled, and others to miss work. I think the most difficult aspect of the job was the store manager, as he put a great deal of strain on the employees. But, he also instilled me with some needed discipline and better time-management skills."
good,Its just the nature of the business.  The pay is low and the hours are few after the holiday season.
good,"Work goes by fast at time, but sometimes it takes a while till your day is over."
good,Management is horrible; it's a power struggle over dominance rather than them working together to build a better dynamic throughout the store. The employees are awesome people though but everyone is scared of making the simplest mistake because they feel they'll get fired over anything.
good,"A typical day at Sears would be to check the various warehouse departments and make a plan to transport all the appliances quickly and efficiently throughout the day. I have a team leader who instructs me but for the most part my work is straightforward."
good,not a known name brand now a days. bad pay. if you dont need money then a good place to work. other than pay it has decent benefits.
good,Great job to work as many hours as you needed. Management and coworkers were very nice. Customers very rude and and abusive to agents. Nice environment to work in and company had very nice picnics and company dinners.
good,"Pacific Cross Dock - Hire people as permanent part time but actually are only hiring for seasonal. When they are busy you are expected to be available Mon-Fri full time, but when they aren't you may go from full time hours to 4 hours a week. There is no guarantee past 4 hours per week. "
good,"Meeting the needs of our customers and excelling in our work was a continuous daily journey. When you have the right people in the right jobs, then the right ways with pride are performed. That creates a great environment and friendly place to work and enjoy. We all wanted to achieve goals and make work cooperative by cross training in as many areas to help when needed."
good,Management easy to get along with. Will get alot of training before you start the actual job
good,"Typical day at work consisted of trying to fined appropriate equipment that will allow me to fulfill my daily duties on time. What i learned was that in order to strive in a work environment communication, guidance and organization is essential for optimal performance."
good,"This was a fun job, I liked getting to know different people and being able to assist others"
good,"You do what your job title is. Sometimes you have to do more whenever they need you. You have no life outside of work, according to the way they schedule. You have to have an OPEN schedule. It wasn't the worst but i definitely wouldnt recommend."
good,"I worked the night shift, from 5:15 PM to 9:00 PM. On weekends I worked from open to 5:15 PM."
good,"malgré tous les année de dépassement au seins de l'entreprise"
good,Sears is alright but I just don't like a lot of things that go on there.
good,Learned a lot but didn't have enough work time in schedule. They would let me work fulltime like I wanted I worked two days a week.
good,Enjoyed my time with the company but they are losing money and downsizing with job eliminations.
good,Sears gave me the flexibility to get back to a working role. It was good to get back to working a regular job.
good,"A typical day we are short staffed.  Often times as little as three cashiers to handle entire store.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get customers to sign up for credit cards, give us their email, and ask for a positive review.  We are expected to obtain a certain percentage of credit card applications based on our sales."
good,"Sounds like a decent career when starting but as time goes by you start to see that everyday will be the same, not much interaction with other co-workers, no room for growth at all, which is upsetting because upon hire management tells you there is. ABSOLUTELY no raises so whatever your pay rate that you are hired at, that what it stays for however long you work there for, nothing really good about the job, my personal opinion is that they set you up for failure when hired, only give you a few weeks of training and whatever you didn't learn, you have to learn on your own, at a customers home trying your best not to make a mistake. "
good,"store clerk, cashier, telemarketing, handling escalated issues from other representatives"
good,This was a very different form of employment for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the customer interaction and sales. Assisting the seniors  who came into the store was something I enjoyed immensely.Working in the cosmetic department as a beauty consultant was my position and I had minimal training and relied on my own personal experience for product information and assistance to the customer. Most co-workers were great to work with the exception of a couple of young girls who preferred to check their phones all day rather than assist customers. All in all it was a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work starts when I put on the red vest. The supervisor can have me walk the store or stand in front of the exits. I learned how to check bags and reciepts before customers leave the store. The management was understanding, friendly, and professional. The co-workers were nice and they helped me out when I needed to learn the store lay-out. The hardest part of the job is to see some customers seal merchandise and not being able to do anything. The stores policies and guidelines are strict on making apprehensions. I enjoyed working with nice people and being able to gain experience in Loss Prevention."
good,Nice place to work learn a lot about the people you work with. Management cannot seem to keep up with promises or their end of the bargain.
good,"laspect difficile cest de pouvoir fixer un RDV avec des cleints tous le temp occupes"
good,My position was seasonal but that's more than enough time to deal with the job. Plenty of customer interaction but alot of young and employees.
good,"I learned how to assemble snowblowers and lawnmowers, I efficiently handled cash."
good,"Each day brought new challenges, both with merchandising and customer service but it was rewarding."
good,Sears was a good place for my first job. It gave me my first look at the working world and customer service. I learned to work with people at Sears.
good,"If you like working weekend, holidays and nights this job is for you. The only thing they really care about was sell their warranty's/agreements. That and signing people up for credit cards. Met a lot of great people there!"
good,I had great co-workers; I learned a lot about retail store warehousing procedures; management was nice to me and appreciated my hard work.  The hardest part of the job was stocking low shelves on my knees.  The most enjoyable part of the job interaction among my co-workers.
good,Sears is a good job for college students. I had fun working there. Very flexible with school schedules.
good,"I would not work there again. They treated people like they were kids."
good,"Working in Customer service, and Cashiering. Very high paced and demand. Hardest part of job was keeping up with some of the managers demands, Store manager was not on the same page as some of the managers under her. Co workers were fun and nice to work with. What I learned was to make sure communication was key to make my job a lot easier and not having to do the same task twice by the advice of two different managers."
good,The Sears Auto Center i worked at was not good. Its equipment was always messing up and the store manager wouldn't do anything about it while i worked there. On a scale of 1-10 it gets a 3.5 and thats being generous.
good,"I was in charge of appliances and electronics. I loved all the co-workers and some of the managers. You talk to a lot of people, so it's good to stay current on your product knowledge."
good,"I look forward to working to see all my coworkers who are like family to me. I have learned so much from sears, from advice all the way to having retail experience. There's not much to say about sears, it's pretty much a basic place to work. I've been here 3 years almost and not really much has changed. I just want to advance my life with hopefully a security job."
good,the location of the establishment was not enough for business and management consistently changed
good,Working with the co-workers and learning the how tos for the tools.  Taking payments for the customers and making sure the account numbers were correct.
good,"This position is ok for a student, not a very stable career path for a person with family/looking for a career."
good,"Even though I was not happy with the pay or lack of hours, I will admit that the environment was pleasant.  The workers there are more like family and always helpful.  I usually came in and started my day by immediately taking over on the handheld ancient tablet that was used to keep up with the inventory and to alert us of customer order pickups.  When we weren't doing customer pickup, we were helping keep the stockroom organized and clean, and taking care of customer orders place that we had to find throughout the store.  We didn't always find the orders but we had procedures for that as well.  We often dealt with customers in many matters such as customer dissatisfaction, missing orders, retrieval of orders, or returns.  I personally found out that even though I am not comfortable being around people it was getting easier to find my confidence in helping the customers have a positive experience when they left the store.  To me, customer satisfaction was priority even though I wasn't a salesman and didn't get commission from sales. Management was always helpful and usually prompt if they weren't busy helping another customer, even the store manager was a great boss to work for.  My coworkers were more like close friends than just coworkers.  You could talk to them on a one to one basis about problems in life in the off time and they would listen and give advice.  Probably the best part of the job was where I could apply my mechanical skills to the building and maintenance of various pieces of equipment such as exercise equipment, charcoal and gas grills, push lawn mower and"
good,"An average day at Sears is fraught with worry: "
good,"Being careful not to miss out on getting services with every sale was an understatement, the constant threat of losing my position due to performance was a huge distraction and motivated me to do whatever i could but at times it still wasn't enough."
good,Hostile work environment because of management. I was not trained correctly and was bullied during employment.
good,There's very little professionalism and work ethics implementation. Don't have the opportunity to grow because the job positions are for family or friends of the lead or supervisor. Almost all of the time the regular employee knows more about processes than the lead.
good,Decent place to work. Nice people. Just to inconvenient to lifestyle.
good,"Check area for empty space on shelves and refill."
good,Simply very disappointed; after nearly 10 years with the company felt betrayed; pay rate increases are only given to selected employees which I think is completely unacceptable.....
good,"Pas de compassion pour les employés,manque de formation , horaire lourd"
good,"I was a backroom associate ok job if you like a light work out, the employess are friendly and will offer to help you if you don't undestand"
good,"No fun, management is basically burned out, cultrue is not good"
good,"I am a recent graduate who would like my opportunity, not once do I feel this desire could be met."
good,"The store is a great place to work. The store managers are the ones that push people to their limits. Some times the store is basically alone, just a few customers and they demand for you to sell more, to get more applications for credit cards when the few people that do attend the store are already have the credit card. As a cashier, we would have to handle customers at the register as well as on the floor. I like to work but when you have a long line of customers to pay and not receive any help with the customers that are looking for things to buy you get frustrated. People get mad at the cashier because he/she is not able to step out and help them out. Then we would find out that the person that could have helped the customer on the floor, they were just talking to another associate and ignoring the call for help."
good,Prepare fro the day and sale as much as I could. How to talk to a customer and understand his needs and wants. the management team wasn't the best but ok. they were young but were hard works sometimes. when you would have to work alone and you have customers in each department and you would try to get to ever customer fast as you could. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the challenge of the job. It was the first job that I had to learn different skills and understand how to use them.
good,Company has forward thinking initiatives in place but not completely integrated in the direction of technological advances.
good,"Co-Workers turned into a work family, giving you someone to turn to. Some department managers rude and nit-picky, store management out of touch with employees. Positive feedback was rarely given, and favorites were chosen often."
good,"my typical day at work starts with a smile"
good,"- didn't have a manager for 7 months that I've work"
good,"-answered calls about parts/service needed for all sears appliances/yard equipment "
good,"As a sales associate, you can only work part-time hours in minimum wage. You don't receive benefits and you don't have a union to back you up. There is no job security as you can be laid off as quick as you've been hired."
good,"I will say that I like my current job due to me needing it. I have a son of 3 years and have been married for 4. I am the one the carries the insurance for us. I have to have my job. But I do not really like my job. I used to when I work for Sears.com but it's office moved to IA. I take the highest escalated calls that we have in Sears. When you get Sears Corporate office number' its really mine. I do well at my job because I like to think outside of the box (grey area) to find inventive ways to solve our members problems and situations. I love my co-workers. We are what make our jobs fun! We have each other. Sears used to be a great company and can be again. But at this time I have  literally bleed for this company with no thank you at the end of the day; We have been on a pay freeze for over 4 years, we do not get bonus, our bosses due because we make the numbers look good but  we the case managers do not.Like I said, I really like my peers and co-workers, If it wasn't for my son and my husband I would have left a few years ago."
good,This was a relatively small SNF which made it more like a home for the residents.
good,"Long hours, no holidays or weekends off."
good,Not made for everyone. If you have a family this is not the place for you
good,A place to work if your starting of your career or looking for extra money. Discounts for being an employee.
good,A lot of quotas to meet. Fun and friendly associates. Management is not where it should be. A typical day would entail creating customers and ensuring that you meet quota's some unrealistic by corporate.
good,"Though the management is lacking tremendously, it is a great place to work. This job has given me confidence as well as product and selling knowledge to last me a lifetime. Before I started working here, I had no idea what my potential was and now I am confident that I can do anything!"
good,A typical day at Sears.. will have to decline..  I can say the job I held made me a strong leader with customers and co-works.. honestly really not a hard part in the job.. challenging at times. But still Left a good name for myself making people feel good. if it was just them coming to work. or  our customers Shopping in our stores.
good,This was a typical retail job which all the standard pros and cons.
good,"Worked directly with customers in person, learned more about the big business."
good,"Working for sears co. was a learning experience. The managers were wonderful people. However, I live about 20 miles away and was getting less than 25 hours a week in general. After gas and lunch, was only left with maybe 125 every 2 weeks. Its enjoyable working with the customers. The most stressful part was trying to convince the customers to apply for sears credit cards or rewards cards so you won't get written up by a manager for not convincing the customers that they need a sears card. "
good,"management was always unorganized. No one new how to communicate well. There were times that the job was productive and kept you busy. but they wanted us to force credit applications upon customers. If we would have issues and call for help, took for ever to respond or show up. always got the run around. pay sucks, never enough hours."
good,good experience to learn to communicate with people. It had it's lows like warranty pushing but it had it's highs too. The people were good and it gave me good life experiences.
good,"must know your business to be successful , coach and training is a constant attitude one most have , drive sales every day"
good,"i love selling and meeting new people, management was not so good"
good,"A typical day at work was to sell and push items for the corperate members."
good,"warehouse working environment"
good,"The day my manager announces the store closing was one of the most stressful time of my life. I didn't know what to do. I tried filling out job applications from different employers as I was already employed, but the more I try; the less accomplishment I make. My manager didn't stated when the store will be closing because the holiday season is a few months ahead and they want to start preparing for the upcoming season. My goal is to focus on getting prepare for upcoming season and to focus on getting a better career before or after this season is over."
good,you get paid like almost nothing and they want you to drop everything around you just for them.
good,Management is horrid and don't know what they're doing. You practically have to beg for hours sometimes.
good,"At sears we had goals, 75% Shop your way rewards, we had to get credit as well.  "
good,Never can keep anyone working here for long because management sucks and low compensation
good,Good job while attending school or summer time for extra money you may need. 
good,"The days at this job can be long and boring."
good,My co-workers were very nice. Alot of pressure to get credit cards for Sears. Too many questions to have to ask customers. Slow computer system. Not alot of room for advancement.
good,I make sure items are stocked on the floor and clean shelves. I work and submit reports. I work with customers and management as well as on my own. Sometimes thing got done three time because no one communicates.
good,i worked there and i personally think it was ok but not the best my assistant manager was very rude to me and only me coworkers could do anything they wanted and not get in trouble wih the assistant manager and supervisor knowin about it i got hurt at work and they refused workers compensation so yeah it kinda sucks
good,"Ive worked for Sears for 5 years. ive learned so much throughout my years. A typical day at Sears is very fast paced, you have to be able to mulitask. Ive learned how to use my creative mind when merchandising. Theres a lot of teamwork which, i love everyone is helpful. I love creating displays and coming up with new ideas for the floor."
good,"As a cashier, your hours are based on a credit applications:sales ratio. I worked with very lazy employees who would go on hour long breaks on the clock, called in all the time, showed up hungover to work, and treated customers rudely, but still got 35+ hours per week because they could push credit. It doesn't matter if you are an excellent employee or give great customer service, if you don't have the credit stats at a certain point, you don't work. If you can sell the apps, it's just a job - no raises, and no promotions. Also, be prepared to never have time off because if you get the hours, you will work 6 days a week. The job itself otherwise is pretty easy, especially since this is a mostly dead store. Management is always will to help, but again, if you don't have the stats as a cashier, you don't have a job."
good,the SCH kmart division is a good starting point for lets say a student in school or a job between jobs but for a full career consisting of more than 180 or more it becomes unrewarding unless you have been with the company for may years. minimum wage is all you can expect from the company and at the end of the day there isn't any room for any kind of advancement unless you know someone or your have a salaried job with access to the internal job postings. overall i rate my time with the SHC a 3 out of 5 stars due to the rewarding hours with the lingering stain of little advancement as well as minimum wage that does not foster a excitement for working.
good,Some room to improve. The company goes thou a lot of changes. Room to advance though.
good,"customer service, make sure the registers are clean and the shoes are stocked and the jewlery and clothes are where they are supposed to be."
good,"A typical day started with photographing toddlers who were camera shy. Playing with them to gain trust and ease their fears and overall ending with capturing loving, cute memories on film. The hardest part of the job was dealing with downed equipment and keeping your customer happy."
good,typical day at work would be just to clock in clean up the fitting rooms and put out any new merchandise we recieved for Lands End. If customers come in I greet them ask them if they need any help and let them know about our promotions or new items we have recieved. The hardest part of work is when you are by yourslef and you get swamped with customers but i can imanage because I got used to working under pressure. 
good,"taking care of costumers, dealing with the register, and making sure i did good on the sales floor."
good,this position had me covering unpredicable shift and lots of paper work . coustomers in the area usually expect the free one so you have to force sales. management doesnt seem to have it together but will call you in the slightest manner something is wrong but never for good.
good,"Some long hours, Working in a hot warehouse and dealing with angry customers alot it seemed, overall not bad but not what you want if you need to pay bills and live on your own"
good,"I am thankful for my time I've spent at years. 5 years just about. That's five years without a raise and at least three years of being passed over for lead positions. The company had/has a freeze on raises that justify by doing yearly performance reviews, where only the very top are finally eligible to even be considered for one. I haven't seen it happen. I've worked very hard for a long time with little incentive. I've had some great coworkers, some amazing bosses, but it's clear to me that the big guys, the corporate guys, don't care."
good,the hardest part of working at sears was management. i think they were very unorganized and poor leading/training skill and therefore it kept a lot of short coverage in every department.
good,Friendly staff but computer system is outdated.
good,"I worked with a marvelous hardworking team at the store. The pace was hectic and I found myself doing alot at home, but would do what was necesarry to protect my team. I love interacting with customer and it was the favorite part of my day. The seniors were a delight. I learned a great deal about inventory, stock management, schedules and customer service."
good,The people I work with are in general fantastic poeple. Most very smart and have integrity. The lands end department is separate and is a lot of work to set all displays and keep the area neat and welcoming for our guests. But our repeat guests are wonderful - warm and dedicated to lands ends' products. Always great fun to see old friends.
good,"I spent a lot of time just standing around waiting for customers. A lot of the other associates were very vulgar and crass on the sales floor, which I deem as highly unprofessional. The management was very lacking in this detail. The hardest part of the job was trying to catch up with learning all of the policies and procedures as there were no real training program. The most enjoyable part of the job were the occasional relationship I built with some customers."
good,Tiene buen ambiente laboral pero quede con mala impresión en cuanto a las oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"A typical day included sales of appliances and electronics to multiple customers. Explaining the functions of all products and keeping the products showroom clean and organized. I learned to be patient and understanding of peoples issues and wants. the most difficult part of the job was the lack of organization. Yet, I absolutely loved my coworkers and meeting new people."
good,clock in sit down and can't get back up unless your going to the bathroom.
good,"Constantly at work so great work ethic is always involved, also great team support from co-workers and managers. Healthy environment to work in and id say the most enjoyable part of working for sears was the people you were able to meet everyday."
good,a typical day is slammed on the phones with customers calling stating how they a dissatistified with the company
good,Management was okay. Directions were always clear and concise.. Co-workers were not to great. Job was fun for the most part. I enjoyed meeting the people I did. It was a great experience.
good,- Helping customers find what they needed mainly womens apparel
good,Most of my managers were friendly. I enjoyed working at Sear but they didn't pay me enough to stay with them.
good,"While many of my co-workers were an absolute joy to work with the management wasn't so great. No type of understanding, and the pay wasn't very good. I was a part time employee however with the way they worked the schedule it was as if I lived there and had no time for my family."
good,talk to many people each day and improve sales skills. Met many nice people on phone and learned a lot about process of cleaning both carpets and air ducts.
good,"Fun people, talking to customers. Easy going place to work"
good,was my first job. managers were not nice. very slow job. worked there for over two years and never got a raise.
good,Lots of interactions with customers face to face. The hardest part of this job was educating each customer in order to help them better find the best solution for their personal needs.
good,"Company was taking over, too many changes, new company did not have regard for employees."
good,"Hard to grow within the company, need more advancement. Using very old techology."
good,It is a good working environment where good team spirit and team work is practiced
good,"I would say that I thought I would have still had my job after I gave birth to my son but in the end I was left high and dry without a job. People at the company asked when I was coming back and I set up with HR to let them know when I was leaving and when I was expected to come back and when I was ready to come back I get the run around to find out that I no longer had my job. That was very heart wrenching to find out that right after giving birth, but i had to deal with it and move on."
good,If you are looking for a part time job then Sears is definitely the place to work.
good,"Perform out of stocks 2 or 3 days out of the week. Unable to order enough stock to keep all locations of product filled. Coworkers are great, most get along great and help each other when needed. The hardest part is trying to explain to the customer that we do not carry a lot of replacement parts for the products they buy in the store. The best part is talking to customers about what they want, knowing what they are talking about, giving them ideas they didn't think about and having them leave the store with what they needed."
good,"A typical day at sears consist of persuading customers to buy consumer electronics. Since I have been working there I have learned many sales tactics. Some managers are ok, others seem to be not so good at what they do. I do not have a problem with any of my coworkers. The hardest part of my job would be having to deal with the returns on merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the sales and also making money."
good,Come in early hrs before the store opens to get things going.
good,Good place to work. What I've was how to work with different people. Management was great. The Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours and the best part was the customers.
good,I enjoyed the social interaction with a variety of ages. The customers were fun to work with.
good,micro managing is horrible! A lot of back stabbing. Home office does not really care about it's staff in the stores.
good,busy
good,"no family time, its all about profit and numbers at sears, need a day off forget it, they wont give it to you, and they dont seem to care about trade licensing either, i was pushed out for guys with no experience, cheaper and just cam out of a trade school"
good,Nice place to work when there is work. Management is a joke. They think 10 hrs a week is enough to live on.
good,on a typical work day we would do nothing but clean until a car would come in and just work as hard as we could
good,Very busy place to workI went to george brown college and studied electrical systems and air conditioning
good,if you do not meet your merits you do not get hours. you have to sign costomers up for credit card .
good,"I first worked at Sears in Lakewood, CO as a seasonal cashier in 2005. It was my third job ever and I liked it well enough except as a cashier you have to push the Sears credit card which I don't believe in because it's a rip off. I was professional and still said my script to every customer. The head cashier really pushed the credit card; she'd even trick people into getting it. Even though the customers liked me and I got recognition, I was passed over to stay on as a regular after the holidays. The girl who got chosen over me was rude and even cursed at management, but she was chosen because she got more credit cards. One day a customer was saying how great I was and she would look for me every time she came in. I told her I didn't think I would be here any more because I wasn't on the schedule so I thought I was being let go. This lady went straight to management and berated them for firing me. Management ended up keeping me on, but put me on in a different department. I know they only did it because of that lady because the manager of the department I was moved to had gone on vacation that week and was gone until after I started my new position. My schedule was changed to 6am, a time I already told them was not possible for me. I pulled strings to make it to work only to find no one else there. I called and called until the first morning bus came and then I went home. One day the girl who got the cashier position over me was very late so I was asked to cover for her. When she finally showed up, forty-five minutes after I was suppose to be off work, she wouldn't take over"
good,"Great Sales Training, not so great management, or competitive nature."
good,Not too much to do around store. Easy to lose interest. Management was very poor. Fired me because I was going to the military soon.
good,"My day at work was always great, I always had good times helping and supporting customer in a fast pace retail environment."
good,"Prior to the take over of Sears by KMart and the business decision to open up the exclusive sales of Kenmore and Craftman tools Sears offered a historical conversation that all customers could share. The history of ""Satisfaction Guaranted or your money back"" and the quality of the staple product lines added to the power of the sale. The group of Sears homes built south of interstate 70 in southern Illinois adds the history of Sears investment in bringing quality home improvements to market."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to interact with the public.
good,"The company is sound in it's policies and procedures, follow those and you should be set. Training could be a little more in depth. Typical day is going over paperwork from the day before, checking the over/short report to ensure all tils balanced. Complete audits done on the weekly basis. Hardest part of the job honestly is all the unnecessary paperwork that must be printed off daily. When system allows you to search back to whatever you just so happen to be looking for."
good,Company is an older version of Walmart. Company has maintained quality standards in consumer relations.
good,Sears doesn't advertise and expects employees to bring in there own customers.  Makes it difficult with so much other competition that does advertise.
good,"Ambiente laboral mal, pero si vendes mucho te puede ir bien en tu paga"
good,"Sears was good company to work for the season. Working during the fall season the store was busy with product coming in and out of the warehouse. My task included unloading trucks and separating products based on category. Warehouse staff was responsible for inputting any products entering or leaving the warehouse into the computer inventory list. Warehouse staff was responsible to retrieving online orders and loading them into customer vehicles. The hardest part of the job was having to do the work of two people due to shortages, although hard the shortages allow for overtime pay. Management was semi-supportive when it came to assist with task, most managers saw seasonal employees as expendable. The overall warehouse staff was positive and fun, the position was good for a season or part-time work. Sears was supportive of any employee pursuing a higher education and if hired full time was willing to work staff and schedules."
good,"Typical day’s at work would organizing each product that had been on our truck from washers & dryer’s, to clothing both men women teens and kids clothes.  What I learned was new procedures indicators of how they wanted there products put."
good,I loved the thought of working at sears. Because I was strictly just a cashier. I didn’t get enough training and the registers were so slow. If I needed help it was so hard to contact a manager.
good,The store has actually closed now.  It was a part time job for me as I was a full time student.  Management was very accommodating.  It was a very collaborative environment.
good,"I worked in the call-center for almost 6 years. Poor management, ultra micro-management of your work (calls monitored and recorded and rated), no pay raises (they used to give nickel and dime raises a few years ago - seriously!), no bonuses (the yearly Xmas bonus was a cookie and a cup of hot cocoa - no lie!), non-stop angry calls. Lots of the departments were closed and transferred to call centers in India and the Philippines!"
good,Working at sears was stressful at tomes it didn’t offer anything for its employees very strict rules and no room for growth no discount for the employees hours was few and lots of favoritism.
good,They would work you as many hours as possible without going over the amount that would qualify you for benefits. Then you wouldn’t get many hrs. til there was no possibility for advancement.
good,"Grateful for the opportunity, people met, knowledge and able to growth faster. Customer was awesome and sometimes corporate fail in recognize that and make business decision to retain the customers. Corporate also let go too many great colleagues because of the bad business decision."
good,This is a good place to start at to gain experience to be able to move forward somewhere else. The structure has changed. so its different now But the pay needs to be raised for amount of work done
good,Sears is closing more and more stores every year. Not a great job for security I always had this worry that any moment we could be shut down and lose our jobs.
good,Never found things out that we needed to know being on the front lines in people's homes that limit us from doing our jobs. Also when the company changed they failed to pay us properly
good,"Working for sears canada was great."
good,"Management didn't know what they were doing yet acted like they were on some kind of pedestal. Wouldn't be much hope of career advancement even if they stayed open. Employees were very nice but management always had a problem with us talking/establishing friendships even while working. Not a toxic workplace or the worst I've been in, but there were obvious problems."
good,I worked in tools which I actually enjoyed they just weren't very flexible with the hours. Several times I got scheduled for days I explicitly told them I was in school and then had my hours cut for not showing up.
good,"came on time for work relaxed atmosphere, although lack of hours and organization team play is good , more hours and high rate of payment will be adecuate"
good,Pretty relaxed day depending on sales and promotions for online ordering. Sometimes forced to leave to save on labor. No room for advancement and not paid enough to accommodate cost of living.
good,always pushing for more . sold out in the end by company . Sears did give me good training as to how to sale . how to show value and over come members objections .
good,"I was in retail, mostly in the background, so my job varied. The backroom aspect was very interesting. People don't realize what work goes into making merchandise ready for sale. I found that aspect very interesting. Depending on the managers, you can have a good time at your job or one that can be very miserable. Everyone was very friendly. My co-workers were great!, That was the most enjoyable part of the job. Hardest part of the job was standing all day and also cleaning after the customers. It always looked like a tornado through."
good,"Take the good with the bad on a daily basis. Don't let one person in Management ruin it for others that are good Management. If you question your role, understand it fully before being negative as a whole."
good,Not a career. The pay wasn't very good. The management was OK. The scheduling was bad. The hours weren't the greatest. We had to rent a uhaul for deliveries. I was once asked to pay for gas lol. I said no
good,"Sears was a good place to work, somewhat stressful due to retail sales and returns was a common occurrence and customers were often unhappy. "
good,The entire last 3 years I worked for the company was a total feeling of doom and gloom with no bonuses based on store performance and poor reviews to avoid having to pay higher salaries
good,"Sears has closed down, it is no longer in business. It was a close and small group of individuals working to ensure the safety of the technicians and completion for customers."
good,"Great interaction with customers, having good relationships with associates making it a fun environment,  seems like Management never gave you the knowledge or tools to succeed."
good,"Bad Management, worst CEO. Company needs to modernize buildings and get professional management. Too old fashioned structure. Too many innecessary changes at floor presentation and a lot of wasted paper and time."
good,"working at Sears was an amazing experience, everyday your day consisted of talking to new people, having full control of your schedule and being able to complete the tasks you need to for the day, it's a shame that Sears fell into the hands of the current CEO."
good,I really enjoy the freedom of being out of the store on my own and visiting the different locations in my district. Very little supervision and free to do most of my work from my home office!
good,"The events leading up to the bankruptcy for this company, took away the pleasure of being a sales person.  Commissions were cut, benefits were stripped."
good,My fondest memories of Sears are my coworkers. They were good people who I always felt comfortable being myself when around them. Management was OK to poor at certain times. Pay was very low.
good,"Shorthanded, busy and overworked was my typical day, where  I learned to be patient and to do more than one thing at a time. The hardest part of my day was having to keep things organized and "
good,"Sears is a big company all associates,are able to work either on the floor, to help the costumers to find the best product they are looking for or at the register."
good,"A day at Sears"
good,"empresa con sueldos bajos, horarios extensos, buenos procedimientos de trabajo, organizada."
good,Demasiadas actividades a realizar de manera frustrante con paga muy baja
good,"culture is one that is competitive in upper management. the staff at the stores are very helpful internally and is willing to assist, it was management that would not compromise and assist the employees who were bending over backward to help."
good,It was a great place to work with plenty of friendly people. I learned a lot about the job from the supervisors and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to finish every task
good,go to your designated area start to clean and size area and if a customer needs to check out help them check out and once the transactions is complete go back to sizing and cleaning area
good,"- Every day was different because got different trucks in on different days."
good,"After 20 years with a company it's hard to say anything adverse about what I learned and the friends I made along the way. I worked in the field as a rep for 15 years, made a lot of money and enjoyed the autonomy. Sales and General management positions offered me a path to create the culture of the office. I enjoy training and helping others succeed in their roles while creating an atmosphere of fun; motivating and incentivizing reps to be their best! This was the most enjoyable part of my job. The most difficult area of responsibility was assuring customers we could fulfill their needs as a dying brand. Sears Home Improvements ultimately disappointed many of it's customers as it closed locations nationwide, leaving them with jobs half done or never started. I appreciate all the people I worked with, hired, trained and mentored over the years and will always have fond memories of SHIP!"
good,Maintain floor and assist customers. Count register down at closing and report fraud to IP department. Offering to help in other departments to stay busy.
good,"It's ok for your first job. Expect unrealistic selling expectations. Depending on your situation, your manager may be difficult to deal with. My manager was quite abusive."
good,"if the manager is a woman, RUNNN! women are too emotional and theyll treat you like a subhuman if theyre under stress, especially if you can tell that they hate their life (aka theyre fat and rly old) other than that the rest of the co workers were cool, most of them were pretty content despite how bad of a job this was, i learned how to handle the freight in the backroom and wouldnt mind doing it for longer, gg"
good,"Plenty of needed hours were provided, work environment was very friendly, mangers were very friendly and open. but store was not very organized. that was due to fear of being closed down."
good,"Most of the managers talked down to employees, lack of hours, extremely rude customers, always kept after scheduled hours regardless if you were finished with your responsibilities, and associates did not receive discounts."
good,"the proper tools were not provided for work to have been completed on time.  Managers had to improvise most of the times, because of the lack of needed support."
good,Sears is a good place to develop basic communication and performance skills. Management is consistent in the ways they encourage performance. Training is provided for relatively every aspect of the job.
good,know that sears in chapter 11 hurts the employees and how we have to deal with the news. Everyone askes if we are closing at our store our response is no
good,Most staff members were great to work with. Training and instructing employees of their duties could have been done better. Some employees also dressed inappropriately for the job which is unprofessional.
good,"Fast pace environment, challenging customer issues, knowledgeable sales reps. The key is to make sure that you are on process and pretty much everything falls in place."
good,"There is a loss of confidence stemming from store closings and rumors of store closings, mass firing of management and district managers. The associates were fantastic to work with, but the moral was terrible toward the end of my employment."
good,"Not recommended for anyone who's looking for startup job, management barely recognizes hard work and reward lazy workers who are under they're wing. Not recommended at all."
good,"Working as a Hardlines Merchandiser, I was very productive stocking merchandise from shipments received and maintaining the stockroom inventory. I had very little supervision and enjoyed what I did."
good,"They were felxaible with my schedule, and all way offering extra hours."
good,"Malas comisiones, el sueldo base es muy malo, los jefes inmediatos están muy atrasados. Básicamente es como si esa tienda aún estuviera en 1980."
good,Working with all sorts of people from families of 16 to dogs and new borns. The job was always fun. Getting creative with shots and frames. Coworkers were always the best to be around.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers with their transactions as well as their Shop Your Way account. "
good,"Ok place to work, if you are trying to get through school. Management was under qualified and didnt foster a learning environment. Had a great group of team members."
good,"There will be some busy days, anbd there will be some not so busy days. A normal work day can be filled with all types of task from the department managers and roudy custmers."
good,"They need a better insentive program they had a lot of employees who would ride the clock, I love to sell so it was like shooting fish in a barrel for me, I averaged 100,000.00 dollars worth of retail sales per month"
good,"I can not speak for all locations around the world. But, as for the location I worked at. It was stressful. working hard with no recognition. Having to take photos of the work I did to prove that I finished the task handed to me."
good,I loved my job but not the people that managed the company. They didn't have proper training for anyone. They unrealistic expectations. The customers for the most part where great and that's why I loved working there besides loving working with my hands.
good,"The pay should be weekly for how much they want from you. I wouldn't recommend it as a first time job. They want you to pitch credit cards to customers and if you dont meet their quotas you're suddenly fighting to keep your job. The hours are really good but not many people work much so the people that actually come into work dont have much time for a regular life. Odds are if you're willing to come in, they'll shedule you as much as they legally can. Good if you need money. Bad if you want time for anything other than working all day. Besides feeling on edge about being fired any second for not getting enough credit cards to customers, its an alright place to work. I think the pay is fair but should be weekly in order for a person to live off of it. 2 paychecks a month is unfair. There are no benefits unless you've worked with them a certain amount of years. Be aware they really could and will fire you at any moment if you dont meet the credit card quotas."
good,Too many salesmen on duty at a time. Job was further complicated by having to retrieve display items from the back and then setting them up. Moving all display items to wax the floors was very burdensome.
good,A typical workday would be opening and closing the fine jewelry department making sure everyone is on task making signs for the liquidation sale prices and attaching them to all jewelry and answering all questions and finalizing sales and answering calls
good,The management looks for active workers. It's great but it effects those who aren't so fast paced because they end up being thrown to the back burner. It encourages self learning and self advancement.
good,"Very little chance for advancement and for three years there was no raises. Was always told that to make more money you need to sell, sell, sell. Would put merchandise on your truck to sell to customers and the store would have it at a much lower price causing customers to think you were making up the price"
good,"If my location would have been in a high volume store, this would have been ideal for my attributes.  The job was challenging and possibly lucrative at one time.  I derived satisfaction providing excellent customer and receiving referrals as a dividend.  Self motivation, goal setting and good followup were keys to my success which can translate to any discipline."
good,working at sears was just a short term thing until i had my son. the pay was low an it wasn't very busy only around the holidays. staff was very nice an welcoming.
good,This company is descent to work for to gain customer service and tech support experience and knowledge. I was there when there was a over haul of changes being made so my view of the company at that time isn't all peaches and cream
good,"Fast paced."
good,All they care about is getting customers to process credit applications when you are a cashier. Management team value numbers over customer service by giving more hours to associates that perform better at processing more credit applications and getting customers to sign up for rewards
good,Kept busy. Just cleaned up displays. Helped customers find merchandise. Put out merchandise on the displays. It was fine working there. It was a job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the other associates.
good,"The company stated upon hire that they promote within, however I never saw the company promote anyone. The raises were an average of $0.05 per year. Management was terrible."
good,the costumers always come with some sort of bad manners so if you work here be prepared. the job was easy it was just the people who we gave service to.
good,"I am comfortable at Sears. We all get along and even though we are understaffed we make it work effectively. At times it gets overwhelming but,we do well under the circumstances. Management could be better if the higher ups could communicate more efficiently. The hardest part of the job is getting people to purchase our services because of their previous encounters."
good,The management wasn't that great and the place was just incredibly stressful. But the associates made it almost worth it. The customers were a handful at times
good,Everybody was very friendly. Although it was very hard to get any type of advancement in this place if you weren't already close to someone in management. However management always tried to do fun activities with their employees.
good,"My store was closed down. I would not recommend any one working there, as they're not financially sound. The pay was low but I enjoyed working with my team. Our store wasn't in a great location for mattress sales - and the air conditioning was always out. My manager was decent and I think I worked hard for him."
good,This company really need to improve their management and who is in charge of the store while employed at Sears a lot of things were out of order. This company also needs to stick to the policies that are set for them.
good,"Long Days, some good people to work with, mangenent needs lots of improvement. Never enough tools provided, do get to keep a van at home. to much papaerwork"
good,i started with  loss prevention and i loved it i wish i could have stayed there i was transferred to sales with electronics and that was awesome as well i am very good at that i enjoyed the people i directly worked with they were great
good,Working at sears was very fun but usually is very slow so all of your work in one day will stay the same for days which leaves you with nothing to do.
good,"The work and environment are okay but there are no chances for advancement. Did not really learn anything new, but there were lots of computer learning sessions. Management was okay for the most part but a lot of the management looks down on regular workers as if they are better than you."
good,The pay is what really sucks if you’re a regular softlines associate because they only pay you $8.25 per hour. Other departments like tools pay $10.  The pay & the hours is what really bothered me about that place. They either gave you too little hours or too much.
good,"Sears Canada closed all stores and went out of business as of Dec,2017. Company has not payed employees severance pay and miss managed employees pensions."
good,Typical day at work was fun and a upbeat environment and extremely fast pace.  I managed two departments and I loved the challenge of the job.  Great customer service is the key in this position.
good,"not enough time in the day to build a re pore with so many firms i need to deal with. "
good,Working in retail is always a bit stressful.  I worked part time and when I was working on something if I stopped for just one second managers right away wanted to know why you were not doing something.  Very stressful
good,"The work environment on a social or coworker level is great. Very friendly. But the training could be called minimal at best, and the store is often under staffed."
good,"beaucoup de travail a effectuer, mauvais management,manque de communication entre les boss."
good,"The managerial staff was very wishy washy and they had issues about being up front with you. So, it was difficult to identify problems and work them out."
good,Typical day at work is working the sales floor assisting customers in your respective area. The manager will give tasks to complete and you are expected to have those tasks completed by end of your shift. Very slow paced place to work. Not a lot of foot traffic.
good,"No wonder why Sears is closing down. The management in this store was ridiculous,When I first started I loved the management team. It went down hill as soon as they got a new store manager."
good,"Emploi étudiant agréable"
good,"I was doing my job and ended up doing other people’s jobs too , cuz management wouldnt do anything about the problems . The trucks had to be loaded so we had no choice.. they let some of the employees goof off when us good people worked our butts off.."
good,Most associates perform their duties with a positive attitude regardless of current retail climate and declining promotion opportunities with Sears Holdings.
good,"Sears is a company going down and away eventually- "
good,Our coperate lied about closing apc everyone was let go except leads and we got moved to ordc and the gm over there yells and calls employees names. Trash all over place said it's not a pority. Has females moving heavy appliances while guys are standing watching. Employees have to complete someone else task to get theres done.
good,"Well in the beginning it was a great place, untill they talked about closing, then it became a night mare.  when it was time to transfer, or try to move up, nothing was avaible."
good,Management was unresponsive and would not take action where required. The office administrators would have to take escalated calls because management would not.
good,"As a Salaried Manager I would start the day by reviewing routes and communicate with techs about priorities for the day. Ensuring they are all set for success. "
good,"When I worked there it was fun, and made decent money.  As I was deciding to leave the commissions were being cut more and more to the point that it was getting harder and harder to make decent money for doing more work and getting less pay.  95% of everyone including management is now gone from when I worked there just a few years ago."
good,"I had some good times times working at Sears.  I made some great friends and had some laughs.  Sometimes though, I had to wait an unbearably long time to get a break.  And the management was always breathing down my neck about signing people up fo the rewards club and Sears cards.  And in the 3 years I worked there they never once gave me a raise.  I made $8.00/hr. that whole time and it wasn't even that long ago.  It wasn't until I told them I was going to take another job offer that they offered me a raise and by that time I told them it was too late.  Since then the store I worked at went out of businisess, so you be the judge of how good a company they really are."
good,"This was a job, until i had enough money to put myself through school.  Work day consisted of stock items and making sure everything was priced correctly, along with billing and receiving."
good,"I helped take items out to customers.I worked in the back room organizing clothes according to size; and I also helped unload trucks.The hardest part of the job was looking for items that were no longer for sale,because workers didn't input it in the system.The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,It was a ok place tork at. Customers are friendly and they love shopping there. I feel like sales associates did their best to take care of customers.
good,it used to be a fun and awesome to work but the company change alot so if you are looking for a job dont apply for here they want you to work 3 departments and expected that you can finish your job asap. working in 3 departments for only minimum wage is not a good idea to start a work experience here although people who is working here is nice but this new system management  i dont recommend to anyone who is looking for..
good,Poor working conditions old equipment and out dated most of the equipment did not work half of the time made it hard to do your job and take care of the customers needs customers would ask about their online order we could not  excess any online orders  very frustrating
good,"There's no benefits, there no assurance of hours unless its the holidays and the pay is very low compared to all the work you have to do. They hardly ever hire full time employees so they don't have to give them benefits."
good,Unless you like working retail and are good at sales don't apply. Hours are based on how many sales you make by selling credit cards. Also system was very unorganized and its slow all the time.
good,"This would have been and Ideal work place. There was a power struggle of management and the new employees training took the toll. Everything happened during Christmas  so the company didn't really do anything about it, they seen everyone as seasonal at that point and no one knew who's job was safe."
good,Sears has hours that bounce around. The manager I worked for didn't believe in family time so you devoted yourself to store or leave. It is easy if you have no children or spouse.
good,"Unable to give much information as store is closing and liquidators have taken over.  Legally NA"
good,Great warehouse enviromment less management involvement. Salary could have been better. Hours were long and often 7 day work weeks. Fast paced and the work flow was never slow.
good,When I was there it was an ok place to work. The management didn't care about employees. It was always slow in the store. They needed to pay their employees more.
good,It needs to improve overall. Was difficult at times to accomplish those tasks that were beneficial. Extremely difficult to retain talent in an environment that is constantly changing and has little to offer in compensation incentives in comparison to other companies. Mid level management is great. Can really build long lasting relationships but senior management changes frequently and that holds the teams back overall.
good,I worked in the back room where I would do merchandise pick-up and load customers vehicles also delt with assembly of treadmills and stuff like that helped where needed
good,A company that appears to be in a downward spiral with poor management who make decisions that don't make sense. Work can be very slow from the middle of December to the middle of September where you can't expect to make your 40 hours every week. They do offer a lot of overtime during the holiday busy season so you can try to make up for lost wages.
good,"Customers basicaly come to you, but perfer purchasing familiar faces, I was new seller on floor. I had a strong start but fell fast after the summer. Good job if you need flexible hours and arent hurting for cash"
good,no advancement. ccareer opportunities were given outside the company.  poor management.  no overtime.  hours were not guarenteed to part time employees.
good,the summary says it all...but Sears in the news gives you all that you need to know. Company is barely surviving; if they don't make money you can't make money.
good,Good People but the company is going no where and or will not be long before they file bankruptcy and have to close their doors. It's a shame but reality
good,This job is truly for those who need a first job or something in between jobs. The pay is minimal and managment is not the best. It is worth a shot if you need a job.
good,"J'y ai été engagé dans les derniers moments, certains magasins fermait leurs portes. Nous travaillons sans savoir se qu'il adviendrait."
good,"Top level management says the ""ship is fine and seaworthy"" but everyone can see it is sinking slowly. A once great company dying off because of past failures and a now poor reputation. Some stores look good, others suffer from a lack of care. Online side of Sears is apparently in direct competition with the physical ones. "
good,This job is great for a student looking for part time. This really isn't a full time job if you apply for full time. Their full time is 30 hours a week.
good,Going out of business. They had lots of time to fix things but they didn't. I can not recommend this company to work for because they don't know where their going.
good,"interacting with customers and helping find merchandise or resolve issues they may of had. Busy retail store, stock and organize merchandise, you need to have great customer service and knowledge of inventory in the store."
good,Es una buena empresa en que se puede laborar sin problemas siempre y cuando se tenga disponibilidad de tiempo
good,"It is a decent job.  Managers and employees work well together. They work with employees who have any type of personal issues.  I think its just like any part time job, but its lacking a higher starting pay."
good,I don't feel that it would be fair to say in so many words how i could care less to write a review for a place that is lucky to be standing after all you are closing right?
good,"no review given Rate this company"
good,"The typical day at Sears, was getting to the job early, and filling out catalogue and online orders, that customers and purchased. And to have the merchandise shipped out on time."
good,Very unorganized and constantly losing upper management. Most employees talk about when the store will close and not if it will. It seems to be a forgone conclusion. Very depressing environment.
good,"Went in for my first day and they didn't even know I was scheduled so I spent the first half of my shift sitting in the Admin Office and by the time I was on the floor, they left me to my own devices after maybe a half hour of training."
good,"While some of the job had its perks, the daily abuse from the customers/clients was otherworldly. I've never been treated so rudely by people who wanted to have their home rebuilt and sent in a request. Not to mention that the system that they use do no take people out even if they've been calling them six times a day every single day for the past ten years.(Yes, I have personally seen this on one of the files.)"
good,Treat the job like everything you do is critical to save the years of poor execution and poor decisions. Have enjoyed the time there as the rich history of the company is pretty nostalgic.
good,This job was only a part time job. I enjoyed working with people. We had our regulars that would come in and ask for certain salespeople. The only reason I left was because I found a full time job.
good,Can be a very busy environment. You will need to meet a monthly quota (sell store credit cards). All employees (from all status/rank) are wiling to help out in any work area.
good,"Good Place to work but unstable.It is now in liquidation so none of these comments are valid. "
good,I have worked for Sears for nearly 8 years. I have learned lots and made many friendships. It is disappointing that Sears is now in the in the liquidation stages. I will always remember my time working there.
good,"Liked working during the day. Liked talking to people. cashier, selling credit apps, Customer service used to wait on people face to face. Ok for seasonal but not regular."
good,"Most of the staff members were fun and kind, and created a work-place type of family group together. But the management staff were not very friendly or helpful."
good,You get paid by the job so if you are fast and efficient than you can make a little bit of money here. They will send you to a SEARS class to teach you how to use the tire machine and the different lifts.
good,"Great learning place with good and brilliant teammates. "
good,I was a cahier and I would have to put back clothes that people didn't want . I would have to restock the shelves and I also had to get people to apply for a credit card . I had a mandatory applications to fill out . I had to count out the drawer the beginning and in the end of our shift . I ended up leaving because I had a 14 fever and one of the managers made me clean before I left for the hospital . She told me that if I left I would get fired .
good,"Sears was a great place to work.  I worked there for over 10 years.  I had the opportunity to work with talented artist and designers.  My boss was a fantastic communicator and teacher. "
good,"My overall short tenure in Sears holdings India gave me an opportunity to learn various nuances of the business. From establishing positive work relationship with stakeholders to managing the team of writers and editors, I was able to take up most of the tasks efficiently."
good,"Great place to work in larger markets. Several Full Commission positions available, always looking to hire great sales people. Questionable job security at smaller stores."
good,"you learn a lot about different brands, appliances, warranty's and the importance of protecting your investments of your home . it is a very competitive place so you definitely have to work for your sales"
good,Enjoyed the work I did.. Very stressful work place with supervisors.. Always talking about each other and causing problems. My job was good enjoyed working in the office.
good,"The manager was nice, and the workplace was fun! It was a great experience."
good,Job is ok it's locally owned store there is always room for improvement need to have better equipment to work with more training for employees would be great
good,"inappropriate  Manager, if you want to work extra hard with low pay , deal with rude, snappy, disrespectful, loud customers that get in your face, and not have management stick up for you. if you want to get threaten to lose your job if you don't do something right than this is the place for you. "
good,"can make some money there, but it is too slow paced."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo bueno, buena organización y administración."
good,"My first job.  I started on receiving dock helping customer pickups. Went to unloading trucks and pricing merchandise. Decent place to work, only certain ares where given a chance for full time employment."
good,we sat on our butts a lot till someone would actually come into the store. delivery day were the best days we would have a lot of fun on the rides to and from the customers homes
good,"This job made me want to better myself because of the little pay, and lack of hours. So I went to school to get my pharm tech license. The great experience about this job is my co-workers they were great people."
good,Calling; receiving calls from members who had issues with appliances for repair and by giving the best services at that time. I have to provided the best customer service quality to each callers.
good,"After working for Sears, I will never buy anything from them ever again.  The only reason I would buy from Sears is because no one else had the item I am looking for."
good,Just love working with them  but need more  help in every department  need new cashiers and have the right tags on stuff make it more easy for you to do your jobs
good,Retail side suffering; commercial side appears to be hanging in there. The future at this time does not appear to be bright with Amazon out there. Great employees.
good,I enjoyed working as sears however the customer flow became slow and as a commission employee this reduced my income drastically. Sears treats their employees well however their customer base has declined.  I would not recommend it for a commission employee
good,Sears is a family place to work at least oakbrook the appliance manager in my department was the greatest He treated each employees like family which made each one of us want to give him all we have to give
good,This corp. was demanding & unreasonable. I worked here a long while for low pay & no rewards. Managers showed low appreciaTion for a Job well done. They were unreasonable.
good,My work experience with Sears Holdings was working at Kmart. Commence as part-time employee at the cashier position. In my beginnings everything was good because in that the company was stable achieving its sales day after day. I worked 30-37 hours a week but in the low season I work 2 to 3 days a week for 4 hours. Despite being a regular part-time employee I do not work almost all year except in summer and Christmas. No matter how much effort you had they evaluated you poorly so you did not have to raise your salary and continue to pay the federal minimum with the excuse that the company has no money.
good,"it was a summer job. Didn't get the full sears experience, but the time i did work there it was pretty slow paced. sears has seen better days. Most of my time during the week consisted of stocking shelves. Pretty much only busy on the weekends, sometimes."
good,"Clean, comfortable environment, contests, lot of training and uptraining, diversity of positions, 401k, Benefits, Health Insurance, Opportunities for Advancement"
good,"Typical day is slow"
good,"I didn't stay long because there were no benefits.  The management and employees were friendly.  Mostly worked for commission."
good,I worked at Sears many years ago and have heard that is has just gotten worse over the years. No one seems to know what anyone else is doing. The company as a whole has some real financial issues and needs to realize its core values again or it will be out of business soon.
good,"Fast paced repair facility that was great and fun place to work originally. But changed to bad when new management came in."
good,I liked going to work and interacting with the people & learning new tasks. My Store manager was the worst! He was very disrespectful and evil to his entire staff foe no apparent reason.
good,"Starting straight out of HS, it was decent for someone with zero skills. But the support positions such as Data Entry, Cust Service, Parts, Shipping & Receiving were the lowest paid in the plant. Data entry got zero respect for putting up with a lot of hateful attitude both from supervisors and smug technicians."
good,Overall good place to work. However can be saddening as the company continues to slide into its demise. Big stores keeping the non profiting stores open to save market share.
good,I was there for a few years but the culture has been withering for awhile now. It shifted from inspiring  motivation with an encouraging atmosphere to motivating through fear tactics.
good,Management was nice . Hours were based on credit sales and was not informed of that before i started the job .very slow paced and a little short staffed .
good,"Like every job in retail there are good days and bad days. On some days people are really nice and on other days they can be a bit cold. Same with management, if you get credit card applications they love you but if you don't the see you as less than those who do get them."
good,typical retail job.. wages very depending on department.. built great relationships with co-workers and a few managers.. hours aren't the greatest but manageable
good,"Management was so-so, not very understanding whatsoever. Co-workers either were kind and enjoyable to work with, or completely rude and draining; no in between. Overall, it was a good learning experience as different situations came up daily, and we were taught very well how to handle certain situations should they arise."
good,"The working environment at Sears is good, management are friendly and very helpful, you can link up well with other associates. However Job security is not guaranteed as the brand seems to be going down"
good,"The store I worked at closed. So I'm not sure what I am really writing a review about. It was a decent place to work. The people made it fun, but the corporate goals were ridiculous and it isn't a surprise Sears is failing."
good,The company was great when I first started working in 2014 once 2016 hit it all went downhill. They changed store manager to someone who was racist towards hispanics maybe even african americans. He never cared about his employees only cared about the company. Hardest part would have to have someone constantly behind you while checking a customer out. Most enjoyable thing would have to be my co workers they are the ones that made my days at work much better. They also expected you to do either a managers or different departments job for such $9???.
good,"I learned to know more options for a better jobs in a future, Here I learned how is the business in this country and more about the relationship between costumes and sellers"
good,"very stressful, never a set work schedule, went from working around your living area, to working all over town, cover everyone else job, with no credit nor co workers being held accountable"
good,"start from home run route, go to customer homes and fix washer, dryers, ranges, ovens, microwaves, dishwashers, and disposals. its a tough job sometimes driving 150 miles and fixing appliances in very bad neighborhoods."
good,was working here for 4 years & not once was offered a raise nor higher position. not cuz i wasnt good enough but because they just simply didnt promote anyone. very busy unorganized store.
good,"Workplace security was not an option, as everyones jobs became void, once Sears outsourced to the Philippines unfortunatly.  The job itself was satisfactory. Stressful at times but manageable, and the co workers all got along and had good morale."
good,Management was constantly changing but if you were good at your job than there were small perks. It was easy work if you knew how to count and collect money. You also have to learn how to get around the loyalty program percentages.
good,"The job was easy and great for work/life balancing. Very flexible with work hours. Coworkers ready to guide one another. Management always helpful.Overall, many different customs come in and out, never a dull moment."
good,"Decent Entry Job For A college stupid or Someone looking to Make some side Cash."
good,I worked there. I still work there. I have had to reapply for new positions more than once because my old position was eliminated. I need a job but I feel I will lose it any day.
good,Depending on the time of the year it was a nice place to work.  Co-workers were generally friendly.  Most of the managers were pleasant but did not like that schedules were never the same.
good,No es muy agradable el lugar de trabajo ni el ambiente laboral
good,"The place was good but alot of drama, and the management was played favorites. Overall the pay was well when you sold Sears credit Cards which was hard to do at times."
good,Was great to work at during college days. I could ride the bike and get there in no time flat. and save money and be inspiring as well. would work there again if there was money
good,working for sears is a good job not very demanding. salary is minimum and don't expect to get many hour 20 to 26 at the most. a bad thing is that during holly days if you call in sick and don't have a doctors note you can get fire
good,"Management didn't provide leadership, the company was very un-organized. The technician received the complaints from customers for the entire company causing stress toward the technician."
good,A company truly trying to do the right thing by way of employees and customers.  Looking at strategic avenues to return back to a cash generating business.
good,It was a fun company to work for at the time until they got rid of the union and started closing down repair centers. They just didn't care that people had families depending on them.
good,"This is a struggling company that could do better. The management team is very busy, and is very hard to keep up. The flexibility of the job is not very good, and you feel stressed most of the time."
good,Coming into work is not what it used to be.  Businesses slowly trickling away online has definitely taken over. Working in a commission based department  is no longer cutting it for my lifestyle being on my own I need to have a job I can rely on and pay the bills .
good,As of now Sears as a company is going through alot of changes that do not benefit the employees as it should. Overall it is a fast past company who needs employees that do not mind change.
good,This is a great job for young adults that are entering the workforce. The hours are reasonable and flexible if you require certain hours to work. The hardest part of the job is finding the manager on duty. They rarely answer the phones even though it's right in their pockets. You work more hours during the Christmas season but soon as it's over you're down to less hours than what you had prior to the start of the season unless you are a full time employee. As a cashier your hours are based on how many credit applications you can process during your shifts. I've learned not to get injured on the job. One of the employees was terminated after being injured while working.
good,It is a good job. Love my co workers just the managers that are there. don't really respect you as you wanted to be respected... Even though you bust your butt to get stuff done. They don't appreciate it.
good,"The job seems like its mainly meant for young kids. The management is sort of a joke and take 0 input from employees, unless about another employees performance."
good,"I joined as a Fresher and currently working as C++ Developer."
good,Not a great place to work - always cutting back on everything - many people quit so they would pile on more work for those who stayed. Management worked more like the mafia than real management. They would hire younger staff over older staff and promote them to the best departments - older staff were treated badly.
good,sears is a good company but would be better if it treated the associates with in the store with more respect and give them raises as well. I love the company but hate how I am treated but it is hard to find a job willing to train or give you a chance so until then a lot of us including myself are stuck.
good,love having a variety of duties and the interesting people that I encounter daily. I enjoy the people I work with and the work that I do daily. I have learned many good Customer service skills through this position at Sears.
good,I worked for a contractor that wasn't paying on time and went under. gave  me experience with delivery and install. It helped me give a lot attention to detail on the job
good,"Keeping employees employed in my dept. was extremely hard. I worked the majority of my time with sears by myself or with 1 other co-worker.  If associates were paid higher wages, they would be more apt to keep their employment within the company.  Also, training for product knowledge was minimal.  If there was more training and better pay, employees would be more likely to stay longer."
good,I learned the retail side of management and marketing. I learned how to manage KPI metrics for retail. I was able to become very proficient with working registers and selling and processing credit cards and protection plans.
good,This was an ok job.  It was retail.  If you have done it once it's kind of the same everywhere else.  There is no way to move up.  This Sears also got rid of many managers after I left.  I left because I got a better job.
good,"Ambiente agradable, capacitacion continua,excelentes compañeros, excelente aprendizaje de todos los departamentos que estuve"
good,"Not a great place to work for. Under staffed, which makes you miss breaks and not get a breathe on busy days. They also can't keep up with technology. The technology they have now is breaking and doesnt work well. Customers get very impatient and walk away and complain. Which is not good for the company."
good,You kind of have to learn quickly if want to make money or the sharks will get you.  Hours are a little shaky and it can go up or down quite easily.  No sales means less hours.
good,"Not a good culture and full of people that barely care. Corners are cut at the expense of customer service. They use old terminals and software that should have been replaced long ago. I worked in the large appliance dept as a sales consultant. Deliveries were botched up too often because Sears contracts out the deliveries. Set up of the appliances in the customer home were also often done poorly and at times with poor customer service. It is no secret that Sears is on its last legs because they are no longer competitive. That translates into employees feeling uncertain about their future and customer service suffering.  On the bright side, Sears is one of the few retailers that pay good commissions in the appliance dept"
good,"A typical day at sears was greeting costumers and completing sales. As well as other tasks such as assembling patio."
good,Buena empresa con horario completo de 9:00am a 9:00pm con salio minimo y no mas de 1% de comisión o 3% sin sueldo base
good,"A normal day at work would be putting freight out or cleaning up the store. Some of the people that work their are great and really make coming to work enjoyable. "
good,"Not a bad place to work for minimum wage, boring job, flexible scheduling when i was there. the management was alright, everything else was fine i guess."
good,I worked here a while ago and it was an ok place to work.  Very friendly staff members and that made working here fun.  I worked at the Outlet store and right now its not a good place to work as they are closing in April.
good,"Was fine at first but scheduling became very shifty and eventually fell to I was getting almost no hours."
good,Sears is large department store catering to the needs of almost any individual. The workplace consisted of mostly students or older adults looking for a steady job.
good,"The biggest issue has always been the corporate office and the decisions that they make in leading the company.  At the store level, you work as a team, with everyone pulling together to accomplish tasks that get harder each year due to lack of payroll."
good,"no raise no bonus for 11 years for non-management and non-salaried employees.  Team members were great to work,  Hard workers were not appreciated by management."
good,"work with great people but keep taking away $ and discounts for employees, and want us to be happy about it, not enough hour to make a living or to follow up with our customer"
good,"I don't know how but they manage to pay me bellow minimum wage at the time. the place and workers are ok. no benefits, no overtime, is definitely not recommended for a grown up adult this is ok as part time."
good,Good start off to feel the commission sales experience. There are busy times and slow times. slow times hurt your pocket!
good,Management is really poor. Poor communication between department. As my department we keep a really good communication. The hardest part of my job is seen the store close little by little.
good,"Did not like working there at all, lots of red tape and a mountain of paperwork for everything. No one wants to take responsibility for there actions. No surprise that they are going under."
good,Ambiente de trabajo no muy bueno con salario muy poco y trabajo todo el dia
good,"Overall, the job is mainly self-taught and you learn as you go.  Sears was a good learning experience on how to deal with issues that customers had with the product and the necessary steps required to solve them."
good,"Employees always brought one another down. Calm work day, many times too much work was put on to a single employee at a time."
good,"The job makes little to no investment in their behind-the-scenes employees, and that was reflected in the way most treated their customers (and the job itself.)"
good,"To unload trucks and receive merchandise and distribute to store departments. I learned to be a team player so that the system works"
good,Do not recommend working here. Managers are unorganized and all the company cares about is you getting credit and they will cut your hours very low if not up to their high standards.
good,no accountability    lackluster performance by associates    call outs   no effort put forth   management invisible except to push those who did show up for work
good,"The place wasn't fun to work on and the managers weren't good. The payment wasn't good."
good,Entry level work place with vast amount of options for growth. Good starting point for a new sales associate. Management is fair and helps out when needed and in a timely manner.
good,The culture breeds a feeling of being trapped in the position that you are in. There is no incentive to develop your job skills.There was no sense of a common goal and the complete lack of a dress code seemed to invite a certain type of employee.
good,I  open boxes  for fashion at sears.  For 10yrs. Not very good company to work for . I  treated very bad  as an employee .  It is not very good company to work for .  They treat there worker like  dirt
good,Not a bad place to work but management lacks in maturity and professionalism. Feels as if Im working for teenagers who are the ages of 35+.
good,This company used to be a great place to work but it has been very hard to progress in the company. Most of the managers have no idea what they are doing and they don't offer raises or incentives for work.
good,Typical work day includes processing of orders and a fair share of interaction with customers. Employees kept a positive attitude mostly throughout the work day.
good,Management Very inappropriate. Clean work area. Co-workers very friendly. 30 minute lunches. Sometimes did not get a 15 minute break. Very crucial on credit care applications
good,"Au cours de ma décennie chez Sears, j'ai côtoyé beaucoup de personnes de qualité. C'est un travail que j'ai bien aimé. J'ai appris à travailler avec différents type de personne et le management m'a permis de grandir et acquérir beaucoup d'expérience. Par contre, la vision et l'état d'urgence de l'entreprise rend le travail très pénible. Beaucoup d'heures supplémentaires non payés (on te fait sentir coupable de pas rester plus longtemps, ou encore que t'es pas assez rapide), beaucoup de coupure de poste, ce qui t'ajoute toujours plus de travail, peu d'encouragement, peu d'investissement au niveau du personnel, aucune augmentation de salaire depuis plusieurs années. "
good,"cool people working with but terrible management, couldnt do training due to not having enough people which means not enough money for me as i could potentially be getting."
good,"Dealing with many different HR issues. Hiring, Payroll, Schedules and personnel issues. Engaging with co-workers and other Managers. Love to work with others and help out where I can."
good,"boring seasonal job with no chance of January extension."
good,"Retail Company with approximately 100 locations or more."
good,Employees tend to assume roles not trained or paid for. No growth within the company is also a turn off. A lack of a proper web system caused me to never receive a proper schedule.
good,This was fun working environment people of friendly customer a very friendly co-workers a friendly fun clean environment and I do recommend people to go there
good,"No work so 40 hour week not guaranteed -  "
good,"In my time with Sears I was able to sharpen my customer service skills and learn a new part of the sales business. I was the second point of contact for the guest, as the first was in a brick and mortar store.  The room for advancement and lack of coaching was very hard for me. I need a job where this is hope to advance and managers who want to see you succeed. I was successful in bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars in warranties for the company. Again, I loved getting the privileged of building a relationship with paying customers."
good,"I cannot speak for all Sears, as ive only worked in one, but it was very run down and even the staff seemed to be feeling those effects.They all seemed to be rather sluggish, but they were still trying to be helpful and productive. There seemed to only be a handful of us, and those of us that were attempting to work were always bothered by the higher ups gathering in circles to chat on their phones. They are a very understanding group of people and very playful, and that made work fun but the major problem i had was our break room- which was located in the Attic of the store.."
good,"Working for sears outlet is a very challenging experience. Dealing with ""scratch & dent"" appliances can be trying in itself, here is always a level of uncertainty."
good,"I would organize clothes department, assist customers with shopping if needed, clean dressing room, checkout customers, In store returns on items from internet. I learned to be a great customer service provider. me and my co workers worked as a team to keep our store clean and customers happy. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the elderly customers shop."
good,"We learned to quickly and effectively cash people out. We always had to be asking open ended questions, trying to make sure that the clients shopping experience was very good, that if need they could find an associate to help them, that they were a valued credit card holder and any other things that they needed."
good,I have realized that patience and understanding are great  qualities when it comes to the customer service aspect. Showing customers empathy is also a great customer service characteristic and helps deesacalate a lot of customer service scenarios
good,"Fast-Paced job unloading trucks & loading customer's products, looking for web orders, to sending off customer's damaged products to get fixed."
good,"A typical day at work is traveling up to 200 miles a day and visiting customers homes to repair appliances. The appliances I work on are ranges, washers, dryers, dishwashers, microwaves, and HVAC (including PTAC units)."
good,Job is easy and was fun to work someone people are really nice. However cashier manager got mad when received second job all because no longer had open schedule. Stated only reason hired if for open schedule. After that hours where cut until finally quit.
good,This job was convenient for my needs as an artist and animator but currently the company seems to be struggling to hold things together and have been getting less hours. The management here are nice people but they dont seem to be able to do the insane amount of work that is required for the small staff.
good,"Good Org with many different portfolios, however duw to recent leadership chnages and vision moving to Project based org No JOb security"
good,"work days were always busy. you would come in open registers, check sales pricing.  Check stock and clean area.  Wait on customers and make sure they found what they were looking for.  Management was good for the most part.  co-workers were great, everyone got along well!!  The hardest part of the job was for me was selling extended warranties.  The fun part was helping and talking to customers."
good,2 stars don't work here if u are a single parent or a parent at all for that matter.  Show up go to work station price things to ship out load trucks make big orders to prep to ship
good,"The managers at lake Grove don't give a cohorts for their employees.they expect for employees to know their tasks and don't offer any advice or help when it comes to the job.believe me don't work there it just so disappointing.Whenever you need a snick to do inventory, they offer no help in getting a good workable snick. All the snicks sometimes don't work and the managers don't do anything to remedy this."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen sueldo(por comisión)  y mi departamento perfecto simplemente que son muy especiales realmente no se que buscan ahí."
good,"I have worked at Sears for a little over a year, and just recently got a raise. Over the summer I became the top in the store for selling credit applications, worked 30-40 hours a week, and was able to connect with the customers who shopped with us. I was under appreciated, and criticized when I did not get enough credits in a day. I learned that the customer is always right, and that you need to be kind to everyone no matter how they treat you."
good,Solid place to work with a great environment and great coworkers. Increasing emphasis on in store credit cards ultimately took away from customer service.
good,"no job security, the stability is unknown, could close at anytime.  More stores are closing every month.  I was good place to work, mostly positive workers but management is very unstable and appear to bee a little unorganized."
good,"aprendí la tecnología nueva en pantallas de todas las marcas, las gamas de cada una de las marcas, hay buena organización y buena dirección general, buen ambiente de trabajo con mis compañeros"
good,This was a salary commissioned based job. It was a very competitive work place. You had to really be engaged with the customer in order to be a good salesmen.
good,"Ok atmosphere"
good,A typical day at work would start by printing signs and set up new signs and take down old signs. Also customer service focus.
good,"on dirait une entreprise qui aurait dû fermer, mais qu'on tente de garder en vie, en mettant à la porte ceux qui ont été fidèles depuis des dizaines d'années, pour y réengager des jeunes sans expériences, à salaire moindre..."
good,Co worker were exceptional always had Customer's best interest in mind. District team micro-managed store staff causing morale problems.
good,"A decent and stable place to work usually with good co-workers. The only downside is sometimes you get managers who where promoted to departments that they have never worked in. (Example: Stock Room employee who only ever unloads trucks and moves stock around in the back gets promoted and becomes manager of a sales department even though they've never done sales.) As with the sometimes you get managers who seem to have issues (Racist, Sexist, Overly Hostile, ect) and the company takes way too long to deal with them. My department manager was all of the above and threatened to fire everyone in his department on a weekly basis. It took 3 months of hounding the store manager to get him to step in and do something about the firing threats and it took 1 year of going over the store manager's head to get the manager removed for his behavior. We lost a LOT of sales and customers because of him in that time."
good,There is a lot of down time. I love my coworkers but the management team is very unorganized. I did learn a lot about sales because I was in the mattress department. The most enjoyable part is probably the amount of money I make. Hard work pays off. The least favorite part is a lot of workers aren't rewarded for what they do for the store.
good,The systems that Sears/Kmart uses are too difficult for the user to comprehend or enter.The compensation that Sears/Kmart gives to hourly employees is underpaid due to department quota.
good,"As with many work places, good people to share the work with gets the job done well.  Scheduling is challenging, as it changes week to week. Solving the problems of customers is the best part of the job which includes listening carefully, analyzing the problem, knowing our products and services and providing a solution."
good,"Sears was a decent job in that it helped me gain work experience and pay for college. A typical day  would have included assisting customers, heavy lifting, and delivery of large objects such as washers or dryers. I learned good customer service. Also, it made me realize that I wanted to work hard to earn a degree so I could enjoy my future career. The original manager I worker for was a fair and kind man. However, the new management has few relate-able qualities. Most of my co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was the physical toll. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,Entreprise qui essaie de se renouveler  constamment pour rester en vie dans un marché concurrentiel.
good,"this is a very easy HVAC job once you have the knowledge to repair and maintain all aspects of refrigeration equipment good support from techs and tech assistance, recent changes in management have made hours eradicate and the job feel less secure."
good,This was my first job involving customer service and I learned a lot in the 5 years I've worked their. I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them with what they needed. The only difficult part of the job was dealing with irate customers who refused to listen to the reasoning I gave them. I worked with  a very friendly staff but at times I did feel like management was lackluster.
good,"Fortune 100 company but benefits are not good and management is disorganized. Management is not on the same accord, the company is behind technology wise."
good,Sears Repair Center in Chattanooga is full of really great people. They all try to help each other and look out for each other. There is just no room for advancement. And as soon as you get used to and good at your job they will change it.
good,"While I enjoyed my work and my direct supervisors were top notch in providing training and directions forward for our business unit, the leadership at the corporate level was less than stellar in providing a clear path to grow the business"
good,I like the job. I just couldn't come to see eye to eye with my boss. She just didn't like me for what ever reason but it didn't stop me from doing my work.
good,"There was little chance for job advancement, and there was not job security at all. The rent was raised in the Mall and they just closed their doors."
good,"I found Sears to be a typical entry level job. I did manage to move from cashiering to Sales, which improved my lot significantly. It all come down to the people you work with, but sometime in in 3rd or 4th year there, there was a merger, and people began losing their jobs. Store closures soon followed."
good,This job is mediocre at best. I rather work for a company that would accurately work toward achieving a goal that is attainable.
good,"The Job it self was a normal job, you receive calls for people saying they were interested in the product or not, Setting appointments for the customer who were interested and getting a sale"
good,"Sears does not respect its employees, they are merely numbers and  there is nno respect for the,.  Sears folded  2 departments together removing a stable pay system for a system revolving arounf the draw,  Making it no choice but to take the draw position even though i was not hired on and did not want a position as a purely comisioned sales  person"
good,"Working here gave me the skills to successfully run a department and lead teams to accomplish general tasks."
good,"the people that shopped at the store was warm and always nice beauce i went above and beyond to help them, but the managers did all they could to fire me"
good,"good,experience with customers and problem solving."
good,A day at Sears Operation Center was like riding on a roller coaster you never know what type of person you would be speaking with on the phone. You would always have that smile in your voice no matter what. You never know when someone would swear at you. I loved helping people.
good,Sears was a good place to work. That being said they hired me during the slow part of the season and being in commission sales. It was a little difficult to keep my paychecks strong. I liked the job but they could have given me a little more training. When I needed help with customers management was rare to find.
good,I learned it was good job for college students or high schools but I learn it was a career because I could not advance. I learn how to connect with people more because it was a sales position.
good,Making sure all cashiers arrived for work.  Restocking of supplies and training cashiers on the duties that should be performed on a daily basis.  I learned what retail sales truly was.  Demanding results from management as well as the consumer.  There were different levels of management.  Lower level managers were understanding and spent time with you to ensure you had the knowledge and training needed to complete your job.  As with any job you had the good and bad employees.  A lot of the staff were teenagers and did not have the sense of urgency when it comes to getting the job done.  Meeting certain goals no matter how hard you tried.  Great learning experience in retail sales.
good,Working at Sears allowed me to meet new people and develop better communication skills while multi tasking. The people were great to work with.
good,"In reality at sears most associates are never recognized. I would see coworkers try really hard to meet their sales goal and not achieve it that day and they would get a ""talk"" from the manager, I understand that the manager must train their people effectively although a few times I would hear associates mention that they would tell you what you are doing wrong but now suggest anything. and basically at that specific store their is a 3 mark rule so each time you do not meet the sales goal you have a risk at getting fired."
good,Not a very productive company. The manager likes favoritism and harasses employees. I don't like how they run the OHandS department and there are so many hazzards in the store that never got improved.
good,Smile and wave.sales not for me i am hands on person.Not a bad job.                                                                   dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
good,Was an okay place to work but there is little room for advancement unless you make sure to sell their credit cards and the warranties on all products.
good,Sears is a good place to work if you are just starting out. The pay was not good and it is only part time making it hard to pay your bills and get by.
good,"Every worker is doing something, everybody stays in there in department, do not really talk to each other, lack of positivism."
good,"Having three different official positions at Sears allowed me to learn skills or obtain additional help with many skills for the work place like processing, inventory, cashiering, customer service, organization, facing, and  multitasking. Management was interesting because the quality of it varied. Some people were excellent at it and others couldn't quite grasp logical solutions to problems. I had many fantastic relationships with coworkers because of my upbeat, funny yet caring attitude. The hardest part of the job was fulfilling the wishes of many customers when the store got very busy, since the store generally was understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the processing job was the organizational aspect."
good,This job was somewhat hard. My co-workers were very nice and helpful all the time. What was hard was the pay. You would get commission for your sells but if costumers returned items it was deducted from your next check.
good,"Sears is a good company to work for in the customers they serve and the co-workers.  Sales is what you make it.  I was the top salesman in my dept.  I was the top opener of credit at 500 year, the next person being at 275 year."
good,it was fun because of my coworkers but they started at $7.25 an hour with no raises i worked. there 4 years. management was unprofessional and shared everyones business with everyone else
good,Fun Place to work with good experienced employees. A lot of metrics  that are driven daily that have to exceed standards. Sears has a great culture in Place but needs to invest in their managers more.
good,"Definitely a great place to work as a teenager or college student, but would never go full time there. The pay is not good for what you do there. The benefits are not good either. The managers are great but when corporate does not know what they are doing. My coworkers were amazing but most of them were full time and were treated poorly. They were the most enjoyable part of working there. I hope that the company can turn around but i dont think it will with the upper management that they currently have."
good,If your a hard worker determined to make money then you will do great here but if your looking for a job to sit around this isn't it. In order to make commission you have to work or you will get paid minimum wage
good,"Never a stable management team & not really a place for you to grow within the company if you aren't already on the ""inside."" No opportunities for a person to get a raise."
good,"I enjoyed selling all the different products, but black Friday was a 20hr day. The friends and family nights were also long days and they had way too many of them."
good,Work days at Sears can short because there is no hours for the loss prevention position. I learned about shrink control which is good for my loss prevention associate resume that I am trying to expand.
good,"Working at sears as a normal employee should only be for high school students. Does not pay enough or give enough hours to live on. High management turn around as well as employees. LP was so paranoid, they watched your every move and would search your stuff as you left your shift. Might be different at other stores but the one at Ingram Mall in San Antonio was like this."
good,"en un dia de trabajo se acomodaba la mercancía,si había algo q limpiar se limpiaba ,se recibía mercancía , conteo de prendas de alto valor."
good,"Sears paid for my school basically.  I had  a great opportunity to work in a department where I got a good salary to help with school, but just that.  My supervisor was very flexible and understood my need for education so I was never stopped when I had to work extra time to get my time in at the end of the week."
good,It was a productive workplace but a little up tight. Co workers were very nice to work with and we worked as a team. There was a lot of metrics to meet which was a lot of pressure and got to you after a while and was extremely impressed upon on a daily basis.
good,"Great starter job, but retail has its draw backs. Low pay and benefits were outrageously priced. Overall a good place to work but the separation between higher corporate officials and employees is very disheartening. Not even a nod or how are you from ""higher ups"""
good,"you can almost asure yourself that you're going to be over worked and under paid for it. management suck. because of the constant change of managers either coming in from a different sears or a different store in general, they try to change everything in one department without even knowing the department or its product knowledge."
good,"customer service in seasonal, hardware, tools and"
good,"There is a lot of pressure to sign people up for Sears' rewards program and get  Sears' credit applications from members.   If you do not achieve their goals the management cuts your hours.  "
good,Good for a little extra cash. Work load doesn't match the pay. Not much if any room to advance in the company. The management is very lazy and often push their work onto the employees. Minimal respect is given to you as a worker.
good,"While the company seemed to have a fairly straight forward nondiscrimination policy, my peers and superiors made comments and expressed opinions that regularly made me feel unsafe. I wasn't able to make connections with my fellow employees because I felt too afraid to talk about my personal life; I felt that talking about my partner and my gender identity might put my job at risk. It was also made clear to me that my concerns were not of interest to the store manager. "
good,"Go into work ready to be busy the entire time, plan what I have to do, and get it done in a timely manner."
good,"never had set hours, could be scheduled any day any shift. there were a lot of younger workers and it felt like I was back in high school. not the most enjoyable job or work enviroment."
good,"Sear's was fun to work at till the Manager made it a competition against him. I loved the incentives, but manager became intimidated as soon as I made it know that I wanted to move to management, then I got fired."
good,Management needs more traditional training on development of a teeam. Love to work with publc and a diversity every changing careers.
good,Sears would be a great company to work for with better pay and benefits. I learned about customer service in the workforce.
good,"I am a cashier and I am in a department that gets hardly any traffic flow. I love the people i work there with but I basically stand all day with noting to do and go crazy, ask for work and get nothing.the most enjoyable part of my work is when i actualyl get to intract with customers"
good,"I enjoyed working the many people I meet at Sears, if the pay was better many people would care more about their job. Their are really great people working there."
good,"A typical day at Sears was chaotic. Working logistics you have certain tasks that must be performed throughout the day which isn't the issue. The problem was the random requests from other departments that was irrational, unrelated to the job description, and rather time consuming."
good,It is where I got my experience for customer service. I learned how to react with angry customers. I got to answer phones and work with the mechanics.
good,co-workers were great taught me all i know about the job. Store owners were never around. Great Job just not for me. Enjoyed the clients.
good,"There is a lot of retail knowledge to be learned in a large company such as Sears. On a daily basis you see the many different types of struggles of a complex supply chain going through new changes on a weekly basis. The work force is a mix of employees who were there before the merger (of Sears and Kmart) and a much younger workforce from colleges and other companies in the area. This is one of the largest causes of the issues within the management. There is definitely an environment of nepotism. There are upper management at the company who have not adopted modern ways of people management and play favorites in the open. Regardless of the environment of the management, there are many essential skills to be learned and as an initial jump start to any career this has many benefits to be gained."
good,"loading trailers all day, how to run forklift get along with others, had good management, hardest part of job loading trailers by hand, enjoyed co workers"
good,The most enjoyable part of working with Sears are the coworkers. The customers can be great and they can also be pretty irritable. The one thing I learned while working with Sears is patience and a great sense of understanding from the customers perspective.
good,Alot of people have gone to sears optical for years because they know the sales and promotions are always good. Its really a great feeling to help somebody on a budget to get a great deal!
good,At Sears Holdings Company I learned many on the job skills that will prove to be extremely valuable.  I learned to better operate different technological items as well as truly honing my customer service skills.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with some of my coworkers in the Home Improvement Department.
good,"At first, Sears was a great company to work for, butt with so many different managers on different pages its hard to know what to expect."
good,"You don't get paid the worth of what you do on a daily basis and selling credit cards is the worst. process a truck, mark downs, reset departments, cashier, RTV, Stock locate, organize"
good,"Sears does have a high turn over rate on employees. They do offer a great deal to our customers, but over load the employees they have. Management does the best they can, with they are handed. If they would allow a few more hours in the schedules to higher a few more employees in each department, things would run smoother and they would not lose so many employees. My coworkers in the receiving department work as a team. We get along well with each other and help each other out. Most of the employees at Sears are fun to be around. They have a good since of humor, and joke around as much as we can. There are a lot of processes that are time restricted though. Such as: receiving freight, receiving UPS, getting merchandise to the floor, stocking the over flow of merchandise, staging customer products, and customer pick ups."
good,Spent all day sorting and unboxing product. The work itself was easy and really straightforward. Some co workers were really hard to get along with but the ones that have been there for more than a few months tend to keep their distance.
good,"	Sold shoes and accessories, answered questions regarding credit applications, and shoe service."
good,"Greeted customers promptly , learned a lot about Lawn & Garden products and hand tools. Didn't have enough management help at times. All co-workers got along VERY well together. Unable to get stock in on a time..loved meeting new people."
good,"It was fun.  But, wages were horrible.  Average pay is $725.00 or less every 2 weeks.  Not a lot of business meaning hardly ever there were customers which in turn low paychecks."
good,great opportunity to work up the ladder. horrible culture and hiring standards when recruiting from outside. many hard working employees have quit to find much more stable professional work environments that rewarded hard work.
good,"Sears was typically a fun environment.  I learned a lot about coaching a team, hiring, merchandising.  The most challenging part was getting all the tasks done on the slim payroll hours."
good,"A typical work day is me working between each of the three ""departments"""
good,great co workers but the pay is horrible no room for advancement
good,The hardest part of the job is that no matter how good you do your job they never give raises.
good,"I love working here because I like the labor and my coworkers, my issue here is with the person in charge of MPU. She is a horrible lead. She does not know how to do her job, treats employees with disrespect and does not adhere to my availability. This is why I need to find another place of employment besides the fact that I am lacking hours."
good,missing the buss waking up early..i learned you need to be reliable on time at work co-workers are good..hardest part was lifting dryers/washers enjoyment is lunch time and sweaping the floors moping the floors tidying up
good,".9 to 10 hrs. day 6 days a week to be able to live in this economy."
good,"I started working for sears at a Big k, from cashier to  hardlines, RES to backroom I've seen and done a lot of the jobs offers in store, poor training and high expectations make this job one of the most challenging I've had. Hard to get raises and an almost stand off like culture make it hard to sink into the crew.  Great for a first time job or highschool grads good building needed retail skills if planning on staying in that field. But you won't ever make much money at this job regardless of your position. High expectations on credit apps and rewards turn over make the job challenging from the start,fast paced unload of truck deliver a high maintenance job but again very little pay, almost no chance of overtime, poor planning of sales floor action plans, employees have a tendency to push the problems on others."
good,"Not the best job I've had. It was my first job so getting any sort of money in my pocket put a smile on my face so i wasn't too concerned about the low pay. All the employees at the time told me that getting a raise was extremely difficult, and that overtime was highly frowned upon."
good,"I loved my coworkers and my Lead, working with them was great. I just had some conflict with the operations control Manager, she was kind of special. I would go to work trying to avoid her as much as I could. How ever, they do not give a lot of hours so time would always fly. My coworkers and I always had fun, they were the reason why I wanted to go to work."
good,I do not recommend Sears as a place to work as a Loss Prevention Agent.
good,sears is a failing company with store closures every fiscal year and hasn't seen much rise in stock since Eddie took over the company years ago. they have fantastic products and great sales but have failed to update the look and feel of the stores themselves. they run an old fashion model department store that is unsustainable in our current market. they push employees to sell credit cards and sell over priced warranties and evaluate employees based these sales. i would not go back to this job.
good,"Working with customers is very challenging, but you have to remember that customer are the reason we were there.  I kept a open mind with the public. "
good,Es una empresa que va en declive por el tipo y calidad de mercancía que vende y la falta de promociones hacia sus clientes o posibles clientes. Un día en la tienda es trabajar casi doce horas diarias y vender lo más que puedas para ganar tu quincena ya que no tienen un sueldo base para los trabajadores. Sus gerentes exponen a sus empleados ante el demás personal para sancionar o recalcar un error. Obvia mente la parte más difícil para el empleado es tener una excelente relación con los jefes de áreas.
good,I found my passion for sales as a young man here. I was mostly just selling lawn mowers and tractors. The hardest part of the job was selling the insurance on the prodcuts.  The most enjoyable was the feeling of selling big numbers to impress my superior.  Management was a disaster at my location
good,"My manager was great but, most of the other managers were lazy and would single out people because they did not like them. They are very unprofessional and do not know how to be managers. They would always look the other way when people they liked were not doing the right thing."
good,"I was in charge of making sure the sales were marked correctly. "
good,"It was great because I needed the job, I enjoyed my co workers, management made it very difficult."
good,"la gerencia principal no es lo que se espera en esa empresa o al menos en esa tienda no hay una buena coordinación, pero los jefes directo son los que en realidad hacen todo el trabajo y los que mas llamados de atención llevan, ellos son los que hacen las soluciones de problemas, ya que el atender a un cliente es muy delicado y riesgoso y no por la forma en que lo hacemos si no en que los productos lleguen en tiempo y forma.."
good,"It was a pretty simple workplace. Nothing to strenuous, pretty self explanatory."
good,"Flexible Hours , Okay Pay , and fun employees. I trained a lot in different things which I enjoyed."
good,"Okay place to work if they were not going out of business. "
good,Enjoy it. but there was no room for growth.  All you can do is transfer from department to department.
good,I enjoyed my co workers here and we worked well together. the store and its merchandise had a lot of potential
good,Everyone starts out part time and they are few people that are full time because they don't want anyone to get 40+ hours.  I got plenty of good experience there and that helped me get a better job so at least I'm grateful.
good,"Sears as a whole is not the best company. Job security is definitely not a guarantee. But it is great experience. As the office associate I have learned a lot and love the job I have. Unfortunately, the pay is not good and it makes it very hard to pay bills."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the negative input. When you do good, you hear little to nothing. If your numbers are low, you know about it immediately and always."
good,"I would really like if retail gets rid of the credit, management focuses more on your credit percentage than your actual job. You can do a lot of stuff in your department and they don't care they just say that your not doing your job. You have to offer credit but you cant force people to sign up for it and the way they tell you to do it is that they want you to force the customer to sign up for it."
good,"Sears is a good company, overall looking for something better"
good,Enjoyed working and learning with other technicians. Manager had no communication skills.
good,"Management ignored those not doing their job well enough and just added more work to those that were already doing 95% of the job.  No ability to move up.  Management would give the very few opening in management that came available to those that were their friends, and quite frankly, those people had ignored their jobs and were always away from their desks because they were in someone's office to suck up.  This company is also going down fast.  Hundreds of people have been laid off in the past few months.  They have just closed my office and let go of 55 people."
good,"A typical day at work was as much as you'd expect: monotonous and frankly unpleasant."
good,"Sears is a good store for young students, but as for older adults it lacks in many areas. Work days are slow on a normal basis, starts with morning meetings, followed by opening the store. Wait on people to enter the store to provide them best customer service possible. Management lacks leadership skills, truly there for the company and not for the customers. Co-works are great and get along fine, all working together to give the best service possible. Hardest part of the job is motivation, low pay with low commission. Limited knowledge on many things almost everything is learned hands on. Enjoyable part of the day is truly helping the customers and seeing the smiles on their faces."
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers, but for the management at Sears, they need to learn to handle customers and workers."
good,I was hired as a seasonal part time cashier. When I started the only manager I ever met was Shelia in the human resource department. So for the 2 months I was there no one introduced themselves as the customer service manager or any other manager. There were no meetings or anything so we could connect with management.
good,"Learning the products of the large appliance department was a challenge especially because technological advancements' becoming increasingly rapid. By the time you learned a handful of products'. The next series' in the product line was coming out. It was hard to keep pace."
good,"Employees are treated terribly. Profit is the only importance (not even the customers come first). Poor poor innovations, very out dated systems which make it very hard to earn commission."
good,"Plusieurs tâches a accomplir."
good,"Great co-workers, but management seemed to be al over the place. No consistent supervising."
good,"Stocking shelves, assisting customer, placing shop at home orders,"
good,"A typical day starts with me heading to the cashier stand at the kids section and beginning to work on cashing out the customers. I would help customers that needed some assistance, I mainly organized and folded clothes, aside from being a cashier. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to handle customer problems. My co-workers were semi-reliable in the sense that they were only looking out for themselves. Management was never around to help out; you had to call them over the loudspeaker for them to actually do something and about 80% of the time they took about 15 minutes to show up. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was having a lot of hours."
good,"I loved my job as a Category Marketing Manager.  Being in Retail it was always changing and constantly busy."
good,"I loved my job , over head is terrible that company lost a lot of good people due to overhead . get rid of overhead and you will see the difference."
good,"Worked in the Milwaukee area as an Assistant Store Manager.  The job is challenging, with very high expectations.  Store management tries their best, upper management is never happy- if you aren't hitting sales and metrics, you won't be having fun.  Work/life balance for salaried associates is poor, 50-55 (or more) hour work weeks and constantly on call when not at work.  You need to be prepared to either develop or fire poor performers, as they are not tolerated.  Expect high turnover."
good,I went from having zero knowledge of cars to being the person asked to get things done when needed. The hardest part of the job is when bigger trucks want work done. They take considerably more effort for the same amount of pay.
good,You going to different departmants straighing and folding and helping members out. The fitting rooms are checked throughtout the day.
good,Sears is a great company to work for but i feel as if that the management is a little unorganized. There isnt enough hours for part time employees to live off. The co-workers are great to work with thou and there really isn't anything hard to the job for anybody to preform any task.
good,This is certainly not a company worth working for unless you are looking for a lifesucking abyss of a company that puts profits above Customer Satisfaction and Telling Customers The Truth
good,Enjoy learning about each mattress and its own technology and health benefits to consumers.
good,"This is just your typical production job, nothing great here, pay sucks unless you recieve over time."
good,"A typical; day at work is busy, I learned tons of customer service skills as well as cash handling experience. Management needs unison, my coworkers were very pleasant. The hardest part of the job was knowing which manager to listen to concerning policy. The most enjoyable part was just being around my co-workers ."
good,"Bad management"
good,The benefits are not great. You have to wait almost 2 years before you can get vacation if you are hourly. It's very hard to move up within the company due to layoffs and cut backs.
good,"Sears is a friendly place to work that offers a work environment that motivates you to learn many skills from multi-tasking to communication skills. It allows for you to learn many systems. "
good,"You get low pay, very few hours, there is no accountability, processes are broken, and very little structure.  The people I work with, including management are easy to work with."
good,"always  solving problems "
good,"great challenges every day, not much to say every day was about the same same customers and same work load."
good,"Good company, very little pay. Wonderful people, part time seasonal."
good,I worked for Sears for approximately 4 months. I was a fun place to work and the co-workers and lower management were easy to work with. There is no communication whatsoever however from upper management and I was laid off without any notice on the same day very.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the time and day one is scheduled. If you open the store on a Monday or Tuesday, expect to help maybe 5 people in an hour. If you close the store on a Sunday, expect to help 5 people in 5 minutes. There is no balance of a slow day/fast paced day; it's one or the other. All around the job is fairly easy. The register prompts you on what to do and say and is relatively straightforward. As a cashier, you are, however, expected to get 2 credit card applications for every 4 hours worked. As easy as that sounds in theory, it's a difficult task. After asking the customer 6 questions in thirty seconds, you then ask them if they'll be paying with a Sears card. If they say no, you offer them one of the two credit cards Sears provides. If they say no once more, you are expected to ask them an additional two times, wording the question differently and asking if they are, indeed, sure. After they reject you a third time, they then pay. In the rare case a customer says yes, the application itself is quick and asks four questions and you are either approved on the spot or they will tell you why you weren't in 10 days or so. After the payment, the receipt prints. Now some places may give you two receipts as a back up. Sears gives FIVE; one receipt and 4 coupons valid for one week. Needless, to say, but said nonetheless, that is a lot of paper. The customer will no doubt say the latter and then leave. "
good,I worked for Sears Holdings Corporation for almost a year and I can say that it was pretty fun while it lasted. I advanced to Tier-3 Escalations within 8 months of being there but their was no significant pay increase for the workload(s) I was given on a daily basis.
good,"* Crediting customers account, processing customer's online orders."
good,"needed better management, worked hard everyday but that depended on your attitude and willingness to work, no areas to advance"
good,Sears est présentement en grand changement. La philosophie de l'entreprise aussi à changée et cela a un impact sur les employés et la clientèle.
good,"My experience with Sears is an ""okay"" one. There isn't enough foot traffic in the store to keep a sales consultant busy. I found myself quite bored on numerous occasions. Management at my store is probably one of the worst. My direct manager is never in and you never see him. I found that instead of asking my manager things I have to ask other associates for help. I trained myself on pretty much everything and that is half the reason why I have yet to progress with the company. All of this could of been just my store, but overall the quality of work at Sears is somewhat pathetic."
good,"I have learned a lot in sales techniques (the Good and Bad), Management is solely focused on Metrics and maintaining your position in the ranks. My fellow co-workers are in general good hard working individuals. The most challenging part of my job is meeting all the numbers (Metrics) that are required to keep my job. I do enjoy helping all of the customers that frequent the store."
good,"compensation is one of the best things about this job"
good,"For a company (CPI Corp) that advertises capturing the big moments in life, it doesn't do much to make that value apparent."
good,"I would go to work at 9:30 in the morning if its truck day I open boxes   and put out shoes inktag work boots for men . Make sure tags on shoes mostly I take care of customers and make sure they can find the right shoe and it fits.Do markdowns .,Answer calls, to work with customers is most important..Then I take lunch and do same help out in jewerly and on register."
good,"Ever changing, but thats all of retail. I learned good management skills which aided in my growth with the company. Co-workers where difficult to deal with at times but mostly overcame that issue. The most enjoyable part of my time there was growing and learning about myself and the company."
good,"While all of the lower level employees were friendly and helpful to one another, the managerial staff would always cause problems and blame it on there lesser ranked employees. The job itself was fairly easy but being talked down to everyday was enough to make the job unbearable."
good,Tough to make sales. Its nice when consumers buy. Selling and educating the products to consumer.
good,"The managers are okay but the pay is awful and they promise you hours but you don't get near it..Co workers were nice..the most enjoyable part of the day was if I was a cashier by myself or on my break. They pushed you to push customers to become a ""rewards member"" but not a lot of people want to give out their information and they always wanted us to PUSH them to give it to us. Sorry, I'm not going to continuously ask a customer for their information after they've made it clear that they don't want to give it out. I literally wasn't paid enough for what they expected of me. And I don't think or say that too often either."
good,"Typical day: Go to work, get yelled at by customer for not having certain item on hand and having to order it online, put away our stock, clean the department, cashier out customers, help them find items."
good,its  a good environment to work in if its ran right. some of the managers were nice and understanding but others were not understanding to your situations.
good,"Il fait plaisir de travailler au bureau administratif de Sears, on y rencontre des gens très aimable autant des associés que des superviseurs."
good,"A typical day I provide Great customer service while consulting the Sears members on what would be the right TV for them."
good,"Buena empresa, aprendi a cargar muebles pesados!, A manejar montacargas, aunque fue trabajo temporal me agradaba!"
good,"Sometimes days where great  and others where not so great.  There was a lack of management skills and the appropriate way to talk to associates, lead by example, and training.  The environment was very hostile and unfriendly.  Their where great associates that worked their which made working their sometimes enjoyable"
good,When I first started working here I was very uneasy because it was knew to me but once I got the hang of things!. I was elated that I took the position because it was very character building! I sold mostly Kitchen Appliances but I also sold Electronics when they needed help in the Electronic Department! This was my first job doing competitive commission which is very hard for those who aren't that competitive. It taught me how cut throat people can really be but that didn't deter me! I kept showing up and was ready for the competition.
good,"dealt with the floor mostly, stand all day deal with customers and replenish they floor with merchandise. i had great coworkers when i worked there. my manager was a nice lady too. hardest part of the job was that you were on your feet all day and they would hurt. you would only a get a 1/2 hour break for lunch then it was back on your feet. i was paid minimum wage back then."
good,"Lack of processes, clarity and specific job responsibilities, typical of a company undergoing restructuring of its operations"
good,"After 6 years, 6 store managers, and 6 assistant manager still no raise."
good,"Typical day is opening the register and selling appliances to those patrons that come in looking for them. I learned about appliances and how they work. Also I learned how to be consultative and help people discover what they are looking for. The management was not very well planned. They seemed to be scattered in thought, and not ready or planned in their methods of incorporating company policy. The coworkers are diversified, and it is a little bit of a dog eat dog environment. The hardest part of this job is that the market has become so diluted with competition in the market, that it makes it hard to make a living. The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling the needs of a customer."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of incoming phone calls from Sears home appliance customers needing either, over the phone help or a technician to come out and provide them with service on their appliance. I learned many things about house hold appliances. Management was very lax. Co-workers were very friendly, you were on the phone the entire day so, the day flew by. The hardest part of the job was having to disappoint a customer with news like, not being able to send a tech out for a few weeks even though their refrigerator wasn't working. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist customers over the phone and helping them learn something new about their appliance."
good,"A typical day at sears is very productive taking back to back call in the electronic department on variest issues like tvs, blu-ray players, surround sounds, along with serveral different device. It is also included but not limited to interactions with diffenent departments throughout the company while trying to solve the issue of a valued member. While at work iam able to work with loyal and trusted advisor that has become more than co-worker but friends that i have developed really meaningful relationships with. The hardest part about the job would be extremely long days with very few breaks and the most enjoyable part would be the people i get to speak with from all across the country."
good,"Sears Was a very easy going  friendly job, where you would always have a customer to come in and make  you smile. Assisting customers with purchases and just having a nice time with your coworkers with fun by competing  in who would sale the most credit cards for the day was just a blast. At the end of the day we all know we tried our best and that the winner would always be told he/her had cheated. The most enjoyable part of the job there was felling as if you were home with family."
good,never were set on hours and schedule. Days I would be called into work and not needed after 30 minutes.
good,"The job itself if pretty solid. You meet good people, but you also meet horrible people. As long as you are a social person and have common sense, it's a pretty simple job. The downfall unfortunately is the management. There are some managers in the stores that are great, but the upper management seem to not care about you. It seems that they overlook major issues and expect you to fix them in the stores. Being a commission based sales associate is both good and bad. The pay is incredibly inconsistent. You can do your job properly, and make the sale.... but if delivery or the installers mess something up, you can lose all the commission that you earned. This happens quite frequently. It seems as though there are a lot of incompetent people down the line. The computer system they use is ancient, and there are a lot of flaws. If you are a student, or are working multiple jobs then this isn't a bad choice. They are very flexible with hours, and as long as you are half competent you can move up in the company with ease."
good,"A Typical day in the work place would be days were something always need some type of fixing or enhancements. Which is not a problem, just call me Mr. fix it. It keeps the day productive and busy with or with out customers."
good,"The company is currently struggeling with great competition in the marketplace. Many jobs have been and will be eliminated in the near future. Overall they started out as a great company for both employees as well as consumers, but continue to trail behind in the competitors."
good,"It used to be a fun place to work,not so much anymore.New employees are not being properly trained before being left alone on a job.Wages are terrible and much more is being expected out of employees with less workers and no pay increases in years. Very few take that extra step to be productive.Very few show any pride in their work."
good,Working at Sears started off great - We have been through 3 organizational changes which simply reduced our pay and took away administration help and added additional day to day responsibilities to the associates.
good,Great experience to advance ones career outside the company however advancement opportunities are limited at SHC.
good,"Technology expertise is ramping up. However, senior management is demoralizing where 80% are unqualified to lead."
good,"Stable, tenured workforce, excellent knowledge about job duties."
good,"a lot of downtime"
good,"Sears has not defined itself as a retailer, however some areas show innovations such as their desire to expedite purchases.  They also have started to market their brands which does contribute to their operation."
good,The job is fun people are very fun and nice to be around ..It is a thankless job and could have better compensation espically for long term employees.
good,"typical day at work would consist of cleaning dressing rooms, putting garments back on racks, helping customers find correct shoe size or find another local mall that carries them. The hardest part about the job would have to be the holiday shopping with tons of shoppers . Most enjoyable part about the job at the time was the employee discount."
good,Sears apparel processing store was a typical ware house environment. The management was understanding and really knew the workers well. I enjoyed my co-workers company at work.
good,"THe job was okay at first. Good for a high school student, but bad for anyone else. No hrs, mad and rude and old management who've been working there since they were in high school. Depressing"
good,Sears Holdings is good for students. Good for part time work.
good,The hardest part of the job for me was the selling of high interest credit cards to customers.
good,Working for this company on the east coast was enjoyable. I was able to travel to different studios to help out when needed. But on the west coast the management was not professional and made me start to not enjoy coming into work. I am happy to made the decision to change companies and work through Lifetouch at JCP.
good,A typical day at work would be very busy for the most part especially during the weekends. I learned how to use the camera take perfect pictures and also setup props for the costumer's. My co-workers were very easy going and fun to work with we all worked very well together. The hardest part of the job was trying to take pictures of  infants/toddlers because some kids are hard to work with but the most enjoyable part of the job is actually seeing the costumer's happy with the outcome of the photographs and making different type's of collages and frames for affordable prices.
good,You must step on your coworkers to get ahead at all. Not my style of job.
good,This job was good for me in teaching the basics to customer service.  It was enjoyable in certain departments but for the most part involved a lot of standing around. There was a variety of people I worked with so that also taught me how to be a team player.  At Sears the hardest part was simply pleasing all the customers.  I enjoyed going to work with my coworkers.  They made the job worth it.
good,"Unloading and setting frieght out, Lifting heavy items and setting displays. Doing resets"
good,"Poor upper management communication...too many directions at one time.  Change is good, but not all change makes sense."
good,"I cashier and make sure my area is clean and well organized."
good,Management was unstable and we barely had any business or made sales. I'm not sure if the location had to do with it
good,A typical day involved the restocking of merchandise and assisting customers. I learned how to work in a team environment. The management was efficient. My coworkers were great. Tough part of the job was getting more hours. Most enjoyable was helping customers pick products that best suited them.
good,I learned a lot from my work experience a lot of the coworker didn't wanna help you. management was cool but a lot of favortism
good,"Its a easy job once you learn your basics.The staff is easy to get along with no problems at all. You learn a lot about parts,lawn mowers,and tools. The hardest part of the job is the customers. You try to help them as much as you can and there is only so much you can do. They will get mad at you if you don't help them when they have nothing to help them with. Besides that not a bad place to work overall its cool."
good,j'ai vraiment apprécié travailler au centre d appel de SEARS . Chaque jour de travail me permettais de découvrir beaucoup de talents caché en moi .C étais une joie a chaque fois qu'un client est satisfais . Les collègues étaient sympas et l atmosphère du travaille étais convivial .
good,"A typical day does not really exist, I constantly have interruptions from employees and have learned to be more organized due to this.  I work hard hiring and training new associates and try to keep in touch with them throughout there employment."
good,"Accountability is highly stressed, yet not enforced properly.  Management is nothing special and unreliable when needed.  Nothing more than a college job, advancement seems near impossible.  Simple, easy tasks that can be done easily without direct supervision.  A good learning experience on how management works, nothing else."
good,"When things are busy, great place to work. Enjoyed all of my technicians. Management is a joke!!! Constantly threatening you w/ your job about quotas, but will give away the store because of customer complaints, will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good."
good,"started out in womens, mostly stocking clothing. then went to stock hardware,sporting goods,appliance,lawn and garden."
good,"Provided customer assistance, managed incoming phone calls, routed calls to correct department, managed incoming inventory, and maintained new and revolving open credit accounts."
good,Typical day at work is receiving freight and bringing it to the floor. I have learned a lot about retail since I've been at sears. My fellow associates are great to work with and very helpful. Management is very helpful as well as informative. The hardest part of my job is trying to get the merchandise out to the floor when there is no room for it but the most enjoyable part of my job is working with the best co-workers ever.
good,"Not a good complany to work for."
good,I was the key caring opening manager at 6:00 am or earlier if necessary. I learned from with in the company and was successful within my permotions.  I enjoyed the district manager and she used me when she needed someone to train or get a job done done prior to a regional visit. I became good friends with my coworkers because I work along side them as a team. The Hardest part of the Job  would be my concerns of the financial stability of a company I have put my life into.  The most enjoyable part of this job was how successful I was and the praise I received from my team as being the best boss the have ever had. 
good,While working for sears I learned how to interact with customers from every angle.  I have learned patients and how to multitask every detail of my day.
good,An aggressive sales environment at times. The early years at sears had great sales training.
good,Mi trabajo consiste en revisar que los procedimientos se hagan adecuadamente dentro del almacén actualmente.
good,"a typical day at sears is counting your cash drawer, making sears card payments, and interacting with customers. Co workers and Managers are good. The hardest part of the job was zero benefits as well as zero holidays; this is expected in retail. The most enjoyable part of the job was coworker relationships."
good,"Sears is a company that was one of the greatest retailers in the world. However, they lost sight of what is important. When senior leadership is more considered about making money for themselves, instead of improving the stores, you'll see how badly their ideals are messed up. Sears has a ""buddy system"" and if you have a good relationship with someone, you will never get in trouble. Not the type of retailer to start a career with."
good,I liked working for this company other then the fact of the distance between my home and work.
good,I would not recommend this company unless you are desperate for a job. They expect way too much for a minimum wage type salary.
good,"I only worked over the Christmas break, it was ok."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and randomly walk around and straighten clothes and help customers find their puchasing needs, although sometimes we are assigned sections like kids. We also do markdowns, signing, truck, clean dressing rooms, reshop, rearrange the store, and build displays. There is not enough workers to handle all the stores operations so some workers are forced to do way more than minimum wage pays for. We are overworked and underpayed!! The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all the tasks that corporate wants us to complete because we are really understaffed and management is not very organized. They only offer part time positions. The best part of my job is my co-workers because they are drama free, and being able to help customers find what they need. I sometimes spend a half an hour or more with one customer helping them find the right piece of clothing and putting outfits together because at the end of the day I want the customer to have the ultimate shopping experience and return. There is nothing better than going beyond a customers needs."
good,"theres no leadership, not stable, stressful to mangers and empolyees"
good,"Sears was part time employment. Over time my hours were reduced repeatedly until I had to ask to be laid off. I enjoyed being given a task to complete and then being trusted to get it done on my own. There was a great deal of self-reliance required. I liked that. I liked and respected my manager and the team working in my area. The work itself was physically a bit difficult, but straight forward and rewarding. The hardest part was that I was unable to stay because of the lack of available hours that kept me from staying or moving forward within the company."
good,"While working at sears i was involved with all aspects of the business. On some mornings i would unlock store, do bank deposits prepare registers and run store until other employees came in at 10 am. Other nights i would close store down , secure all monies , shut down computers , and secure store. I enjoyed dealing with all the many people I dealt with. To sum it up , i enjoyed my job."
good,"Diagnose, repair and maintain automobiles. Weak management."
good,The people there were very nice and went out of their way to make me feel welcome
good,"This place wasn't for me. It was fun in the begining but when you're scheduled to work from open to close (9am-9pm) with no breaks or lunchs it takes a toll. The manager was so great for the first couple of months then she made it known that she didnt really want to be there anymore and it made everyone lose their passion for the place. In a fairness, I have visited the studio recently and it looks amazing and from what I hear the new manager is awesome, ive met her before and she really loves her job and the company. she takes great photos and has a passion for what she does. I really wish she had been my manager because they all get breaks and lunches now lol."
good,route specialist for in home service technicians
good,"the most important part of the job is creating a unique experience to everyone who comes in, with it being at the mall of america you meet a variety of guests who all have an individual approach."
good,"I loved working here.....but when the seasonal position ended they set up an interview with another dept...I nailed the interview, but didnt get hired because i dont have ""sales"" experience..if you are already an employee, they should have just hired you."
good,"It was very stress full most days, had to deal with a lot of complaining customers daily and the management would not step in until absolutely had to. It was very aggravating wasting time with customers that complain over and over when your working on commission. I feel the position is very under paid, the commission percentage is a joke, made me feel very unappreciated. I enjoyed the atmosphere the regular customers and working with cars, butt management was very unorganized. Most of the managers are friends of the district manager, and I think that's only reason they got the position."
good,*Con un afluente de clientes bueno.
good,"shift leads were fun, great co workers. the only time you get hours is around christmas time."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Sears, but have faced many challenges. For the most part management is helpful, but at times moody depending on who you talk to. Nothing is consistant and things are always changing. This includes policies and hours worked. Many processes are not being followed and it seems to me that management and the associates don't care about doing things the right way the first time. The hardest part about my job was picking up the slack of everyone else. Having knowledge in a lot of areas of no one willing to learn how to do things right. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with my co-workers and assisting customers. Everyday was a challenge and never dull. Some days were challenging than others, but overall I enjoyed working at Sears."
good,"Discounts were great, you might give your check back. A day at work is working with all kinds of customers, managers were not that bad but you could call for a manager and they did not answer you. Hardest part was credit apps. This is how you get hours, they want you to harass customers to open credit cards, shop your way reward cards. This hurt you if you are not doing well.Co-workers gossip gossip gossip, enjoyable part was knowing the deals that were going on to get first grabs. My time here know one got promoted or even advanced to a ft position."
good,"Enjoyed providing customer service in any way possible, learned to use the cash register, co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. Management at the specific store was not the best, employees could be treated better."
good,Very phone oriented job
good,hardest part of the job is asking customers for credit apps and then getting write ups if you do not meet goals
good,A full time job with changing hours and days of the week each and every week. The only benefit is two weeks paid vacation after two years employment. Management is constantly changing. Sears seems to be trying to find its way in a changing and challenging market. The struggle has cost it some very talented management personnel.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers, other in that I really do not have a comment"
good,Only worked here for the holidays. Retail was ok. Crew was great.
good,"When busy you worked hard, but you had your slow time as well."
good,Learned a lot and got a lot of opportunities to grow but very little recognition and the benefits/pay were not equal to the work performed by most associates.
good,"When I arrive at work, I go to a cash rap (set of 4 cash registers). If I am there to open a register I will have to go pick up cash bags and count down cash registers. If needed I will go get change for a register in the main office. Ringing up merchandise is the main task at work. The company requires us to acquire credit applications for our instore ""Sears Credit Card"" from customers. If goal not me, counseling might occur. We also help to restock merchandise and to keep our work area clean. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with difficult or irritated customers, and achieving good ""numbers"" when it comes to credit applications."
good,Traveled to customers homes in many citys though out Ga. to make repairs on there lawn equipment or power tools. Hardest part was not knowning how manystops or how long your day was going to be. I enjoyed most of the customers and the feeling of helping them out.
good,I was working in friendly team but not with easy going manager
good,"El típico día de trabajo en Sears era llegar temprano a la junta para saber que persona vendió mas el día anterior, presionarte con solicitudes a la vez que con tu cuota. Lo que aprendí es mejorar para mi misma y para la empresa en la que estoy, no para los Jefes o Gerentes. La dirección y la Gerencia como siempre intocables e irracionables. Mis colegas, gracias a ellos dure todo el tiempo en Sears, ellos me ayudaron a crecer dentro de la empresa, con o sin la ayuda de un Jefe. Lo mas difícil es pasar mas de 14 horas dentro de la empresa. Lo que mas me gusto es hacer amigos y compañeros, ya que con ellos compartía ciertos gustos y al hacer eso, llegaba mas rapido a destacar, juntos en equipo."
good,it was just a high school side job that got me by the management wasnt really around i stocked and sold shoes on my own i taught my self the tricks to get through the day.
good,"Sears had adequate pay, but was often difficult to work for due to the management. The hardest part of the job was not letting others ruin your attitude. Most enjoyable was being with a team that works well together."
good,typical day at work is a arriving at 7 for a meeting about the previous days work and how the company did as a whole. What I learned was running a company like sears carpet cleaning is hard work. Both my co-workers and management for sears is excellent. Hardest part of the job is working long hours and not making enough money from it.
good,"Worked with the public, seeing family's smiling and dressed at their best, great expressions and memories made, co-workers are semi friendly, hardest part was selling enough for bonuses, enjoyed seeing kids and smilng faces"
good,My main objective was to sell major applliances however I was also responsible for backorder notices signing in the department and promotional boards to post in the store highlighting any promotions or deals Sears had going at the time.
good,"A typical day required one employee to handle all the details of setting up the department to be ready to show. Electronics took up a lot of floor space, but would typically be one person. The other departments would be larger as an aggregate, but would have 4 to 5 associates as a whole. Hours were very sparsely distributed in electronics. The hardest part would be trying to do all the maintenance tasks while still help[ing all the customers, which in the rare times that there were too many customers, would cause service to suffer. Management was specifically told to give adequate reviews (below a 3 on a 1 to 5 scale) to all employees so that no raises would be given. Compensation was commisioned based, but the scale would have had to go up if they were. Promotions only happened to cover vacancies. Many of the employees in the departments had been there for decades, inspite of a handful of them regularly selling over one million in product per year."
good,I enjoy the everyday work. Making customers have a great experience there is nice to see.
good,"Business in which advancement in possible through management, if willing to travel and abandon family."
good,"This is a part time job...the job is a good job. I come in to work and prepare for the day's sales...opening the register and preparing the dept for the day. I've learned a lot about hardware and its items. Management is competant and most of the time easy to get along with. The co-workers are not the most educated people, but they learn fast and make things work. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell the extended warranty for Sears. I enjoy selling the merchandise to the customers...seeing the customer gets the right piece of merchandise for what they came in for."
good,I liked the fact management would have specialist come in and train the employees on the baby items that they sold. Also teach the employees to have more knowledge on safety standards for each different product.
good,"I enjoyed working there,my fellow employees are like family. The thing I learned from this job is very strong customer service skills, the ability to deal with all kinds of personalities. Also to problem solve and find resolutions and ensure our customers are please with their product and their shopping experience. Also I am in charge of maintaining product integrity to ensure sales."
good,"My work is part-time, I work 15 hours per week. the most enjoyable part of the job is greeting and helping customers. My co-workers are friendly also management."
good,Hours are bad unless you are management. It varies from super slow to very busy. It is all about customer service from the moment the walk in to after they pick up their product
good,"Work for Sears Home Improvement, Customer Service, Inbound calls , and scheduled Appointments"
good,The job required a lot of pressure to sign people up for credit cards
good,Good job to meet and greet public. Excellent for a student that wants alot of hours and able to work them. Management was poor.
good,"A typical day at work started off when I would get there at about nine-thirty in the morning, I would grab the register bag to the customer service desk. I would spend the day dealing with disgruntled customers the best I could. I learned how to handle disgruntled customers as well as customers that were just looking to return something. The hardest part of the job was dealing with so many disgruntled people and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers who shared the same amount of enthusiasm for solving problems."
good,"I'm not sure about the company as a whole, but the sears store in my town is AWFUL. It seems they don't keep any employee there longer than 14 months. I finished the training in no time at all, and was quickly put on the sales floor. I was supposed to stay on training pay for maybe one more month, however through the SIX MONTHS i had worked there, I had been on training pay the ENTIRE time. The most ironic part, the reason I was not placed on commission, is because I needed to have a high number of Protection Agreements. The only problem was, even if I was positive in them, my boss would tell me that I needed to keep raising it hire before I would be put on commission pay. I finally decided to call it quits, after the store manager insisted I go to work after I had been confirmed with the doctor with strep throat."
good,I learned so much from sears holdings. One of the major things i learned was how to deal with several issues at one time. balancing my time and finding the time to get all my work complete.
good,"The job is not difficult however the demand can sometimes get out of hand. A work day could be 8 appliances and 40 miles of travel or 24 appliances and 200 miles. The appointment windows can make it difficult to arrive at all jobs on time. During the appointment the tech is requested to sell products to the customer, which is made more challenging due to the high prices of the products. It can be done but at times you feel guilty for charging so much. I do get to meet alot of people however there isn't alot of oppertunites to grow friendships."
good,The hours were very flexible when it came to school. A typical day at work was very slow. My co-workers were very nice.
good,"20+ years in varied retail management positions. Mostly as a store manager. Was asked to take over the Sears outlet when GM resigned. With my experience I accepted this challenge willingly and looked as an opportunity to advance into GM position. My expectation based on store performance was that I would be promoted after a short while and per policy, no existing internal candidate was found to replace open position. This did not happen, I proceeded to continue to mange the store for the next 5+ months with no salaried support management to assist. I also received no increase in compensation for my increased responsibilities. The store thrived during this time with double digit increases in both comp store and plan sales and many other key metrics. This lack of personnel responsibility from Sears corporate resulted in my being terminated due to challenging policy and procedure."
good,"'Underlings' are unappreciated by management, favorites are often chosen based solely on their ability to get credit or make very large sales. It is very difficult to be promoted from within the company, management is always from outside the company and very rarely have an understanding of how things run on the floor. Most employees are highly dramatic in a high school fashion, and almost always gossip. Customers are often ignored if it is felt they won't be making a large sale. The only pro is that the managers tend to work well with your schedule."
good,"Along with the daily timekeeping which includes entering punch times & timesheets I also process short term disability, vacation & personal holiday request, and salary advances. I run daily, weekly & monthly reports. Maintain a strict e-filing system while also maintaining a very close relationship with the districts which includes local HR, tech managers & the technicians."
good,"Store closings, stock dropping. Full time employees only work 32 hours. Training porgram is flawed with outdated computer programs that most employees can just skip past."
good,I loved working here as a sales associate and cashier. I learned to manage money and learn a bit about product knowledge and sales information. Great job for teens and seasonal employment opportunities.
good,Worked there for a short period of time. Worked in a few different departments. Learned about different areas of the store.
good,Company in decline and grassping at straws causing unstibility in work place
good,Hours were great at the beginning but then they slowly started to suck. Working one day a week is not financially stabled enough for me.
good,I have worked for the company for almost 15 years. I started out working as a shoe salesman and after I finished college i entered in the Management trainee program.
good,needs to improve on protocols which can improve quality. often found that there is limited support when handling escalated situations. even so training allows the representative to overcome these discrepancies
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for. The company is going through some changes, and that is why I am looking for another job."
good,The people are great but the company has really gone thru some changes even from the time that I started and I won't say they are all good. They need to get back to basics and listen to their people and the customers.
good,"Sears was all about making money for the store. If it could make them money they did it. Worked the current employees as far as they could without paying benefits. Small crews whenever possible. Customer service was not a priority with them. Pushing the credit cards was their main focus."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the location I was at.  Lots of task, projects and sales motivating goals to keep you busy.  I enjoyed mainly the shipping and handling of products the most"
good,I enjoyed working here I had good workers and managers location was extremely far burn  still managed hours were very short not enough money in the company to pay employees to get more hours
good,It’s a alright job but it’s pay is low for a job that should pay higher. I would prefer at least $12 and a bit more hours since it’s low pay and better equipment to unload the trucks faster
good,They are very disorganized as a company and were at the end of their tenure when I was hired. Management was poor and employees were often left by themselves with nothing to do.
good,"empresa competitiva, jornadas de trabajo en ocasiones muy largas, algunos fueron buenos compañeros en el momento que trabaje."
good,"No collaboration between associates, management practically non existent therefore forces you to be more self-initiated and less reliant on supervisors"
good,en general la empresa es buna las prestaciones son buenas pero falta mucha capacitacion y falta de relacion con empmeados a todos los niveles
good,"The company has been stuck in the 1980's since the 1980's. They refuse to update equipment and fixtures, demand hard lines sales people meet rediculous metrics for their 'Protection Agreements' which are a generally unneeded extended warranty. If you don't meet your PA metric, you are fired. You can be reprimanded for any kinds of dips in sales numbers, and if your numbers slip your schedule suddenly changes to the worst possible hours to bring those numbers up. This is explained as 'To help you boost your numbers'. Even after earning their highest reward for the hard lines the 'Best in Blue' award, and helping raise the electronics department from negative numbers to positive you can still be fired for stupid antiquated policies."
good,Slow placed and not a really fun job culture. poorly managed. only benefits were discount card. they don’t really care about the employees. i wouldn’t recommend a friend
good,"Francamente, cuesta mucho trabajo escalar a un puesto mejor, para después no conseguir el apoyo por parte de gente de jerarquía mayor. El sueldo no incrementa mucho con la antigüedad, sin embargo, se te exige más."
good,"The workplace was very disorganized, and the managers didn’t make it any better. All anyone was worried about was meeting their goals given by the managers. However there was time for fun when no one was around. 😉"
good,It will be a great place to work if they gave promotions raises and gave better discounts and gave more hours.Sears has a lot of favoritism when it comes to employees
good,"As a customer service associate i had to assist customers with any questions that they had, locating a particular item for them or explaining to them about certain items that they were interested in."
good,"It was a fresh out of school job, no real growth potential.  A way to gain independence and sample the working world.  I did not have a high expectation and no possibility of growing a career."
good,"Working for Sears is greatly impacted by the poor public perception, and overall lack of success as an organization. Customers know, employees know, and management knows. There a plenty of folks working very hard to provide great service, unfortunately they are swimming against the current. As any google search of Sears will illustrate."
good,Short staffed.  Was unable to complete the jobs that needed to be done due to staff calling out all the time.  I did enjoy the most of the other employees.
good,"Sears was a company in transition when I worked there and was starting to show signs of strain.  Sears attracted an older clientele with very well defined expectations with regard to the service and the products offered.  Unfortunately, the Sears that I worked for in the later period did not often meet those expectations.  For example, a machine or tool under warranty that needed repair was often sent out to a remote location for months at a time before being returned fixed.  The quality of the merchandise was not what customers had come to expect from years past and the appearance of the store had suffered from neglect.  Most of the employees were fairly new and inexperienced because the low pay and poor benefits guaranteed a large turnover in the store.  There was a great deal of frustration among employees like me who worked hard to sell at the highlest level only to receive tiny commissions."
good,"Sears was a good place to work. I worked in HR, H&S and the office, learning along the way.  Too bad the upper management couldn't manage and we lost our jobs."
good,Mangement wasn't great. As soon as mangers found out I was Trans they treated me with so much disrespect. I didn't like working with people that worked there longer because the head boss would always pick there side.
good,"Telemarketer	"
good,As a falling company there was little room for advancement in positioning or pay. Benefits were lack luster to say the least. The drive to achieve goals was aggressive given it is a falling company
good,"When I first started working for Sears I would've recommended it to any one of my friends, family, or random person looking for a job. Where I started we had great managers, co-workers that became friends, and great flexibility. After going to be under a new manager I hated the push and the lack of thankfulness. There isn't anything that's ever good for my new manager and I feel really un valued along with my other co-workers. I've since started hating going to work and have started looking for a new job since... you can't work in place that you don't feel is treating you fairly. Another reason I say this is a starter job is because while the people at the stores are making state minimum wage ($8.46 for me), the top executives are getting $25 million reserved for them. There's a reason Sears isn't doing well and it shows once you're on the inside."
good,"you are assign a task, maintain the floor as clean as you can throughout the day and once the store closes, you have an hour to completely clean your department. sometimes you will be on cashier depending the line. credit is encouraged to get."
good,Sorry to hear that they have gone bankrupt! That explains why the wage was so low and only management got raises. They wanted to work you to death and pay you the bare minimum. I remember working a 16 hour shift and being run into the ground. They were always short staffed because of the poor management & low pay
good,Sears was an okay company to work for. Although they are far and in between now. They offered great benefits and the hours were reasonable. Opportunity to move upward.
good,"I learn a lot from Receiving to Shoe Coordinator"
good,"After Hurricane Ike, everybody lost their appliances. Therefore, sales was very high for a couple years afterwards, then fell to zilch."
good,"It was hard  to work under management that seemed more lost than the employees. It should be management holding the store together, not just the employees."
good,"There was no training, my manager had no experience and was more often doing the work of a laborer. There was no communication on changes to inventory designations, requiring trial and error, or personally finding the correct place. Frequently it was unknown what work needed to be done or if work required sign off for completion. Nobody was capable of receiving merchandise or organizing outgoing merchandise. Frequent lack of technical operators."
good,"-mostly relaxed working environment"
good,"My role was purely seasonal."
good,Since the position was over 20 years ago and the company is currently in bankruptcy so much has changed since I departed. I was responsible for overseeing approx $500/mil/yr in payments.
good,"managers are puppets from upper management, Each store should be ran independently because each location is different. Old way of doing things do not match up with todays economy"
good,Turnover rate for store managers was high. They cared more about the store than the customers. Things were very unorganized and hectic. Issues that could’ve easily been avoided were not handled correctly.
good,"Trabajo muchas precios y muy desordenado,te encargas de todo"
good,"I enjoyed working at sears it had a great environment, but since the stores are closing it is the end of an era I would have loved to worked for them longer, But sears is just a resume builder job for me."
good,The hay days for Sears is long gone and operations needs to face the music and their metrics and quotas should match that fact but great training and management team though.
good,"I think Sears is great for first time job seekers. There are no benefits only the higher departments like electronics, jewelry, and bedding receive benefits. Merchandise assistant daily task included changing sale signs, folding clothes, cashier assistant, stocking and helping customers.  Easy job up until holidays are busy, no time off during holiday season. Management is okay depending on the department."
good,"At one time a superb place to work. People focused, merchandise focused, innovative. After the merger with Kmart, the company rapidly declined in every way. It didn't get excessively bad until around 2010/2011 time frame. A lot of great people there at was once an amazing company."
good,"My job consisted of me stocking electronics and running the lay away program. I would make sale tags, put out the ad, put customer purchases in layaway (if permitted) and helped customers find what they needed and not exactly what they wanted."
good,"Typical day at work includes completing all the daily tasks ,such as putting out new product,signing and serving members."
good,"By working from home, I probably worked longer hours some days then if I went into a office.  "
good,"A typical day at Sears is having a constant work flow and learning how to assist each customer with excellent customer service that has different needs  This is a casual to professional dressed environment that strives on morals and integrity which assist with helping the sales person with the hardest part of the day,which would be trying to help a customer with no information. There is a rewarding part of the day and that is getting the sale, giving excellent customer service and leaving the returnable customer with a good feeling.."
good,Sears has unrealistic sales goals.  Management needs to do something about the unrealistic sales goals.  Staff members are professional.  The working environment was satisfactory.
good,Sears has been very accommodating to my need for part time work.  I do not receive pay for any time off per agreement with management.  The work load is heavy (I have 12 Divisions that I am responsible for) and frustrating.  Management in all levels do not communicate well with their employees except for daily meetings to go over matrix.  The pay is very low and there is no hope of a salary increase.  I was promised an increase within 6 months of employment because of my experience level but after a year and half it is non-existent.  I am appreciative for the freedom of time off and a set schedule.
good,"Kmart was a good job, until the CEO closed the store without any warning. People were great. Customers were great. Coworkers were great. CEO was not very great."
good,"Technical support is the only place in the call center where you can actually make a respectable income, about $20/hour, but you need to know how to read wiring diagrams, have some exposure to repairing home appliance products, and work with technicians over the phone who are usually very under-trained."
good,"It began as a nice place to work. However, as most people are now aware, Sears is in a ""death spiral"" with almost no hope of recovery. My immediate manager was excellent to work for. Jobs and tasks were assigned with a reasonable deadline. Was accessible and available for conversations and questions. I enjoyed my work until the down-sizing and my position was eliminated."
good,"job was 30 -40 mins away and shift was late at night. working to pay for gas"
good,Working on commission sucks. Especially at Sears. I cannot stress this enough. Not a big fan. Also tired of writing reviews. Enough characters yet? Ye
good,"Things were a little chaotic working there. I was hired to be a temp cashier, but ended up running more errands than doing my actual job. It didn't help I was one of the only people willing to put in the extra work, so because of that, they ended up using me for a bunch of random jobs. I never really did the job I was hired for, unless they got desperate, then they put me on the register. There were bonuses for upselling credit cards, but as I was never really on the till, I didn't get those bonuses. I also didn't like the pressure they put on you to sell those credit cards. I saw way too many people pushing customers to get one even if the customer made it clear they didn't think it was a good  idea."
good,That place is so slow paced and its not a place i would recommend no one to work at no retirement no 401k no anything just not a good place to work at all
good,"Store manager had us breaking rules, then in the end didnt stand up for us, the only way to get and keep hours was to sell credit apps, get the #'s, I had great reviews, I was asked to preinterview and I was the ONLY one allowed to train nee hires and when LP came along and fired my cashier and myself for doing what our store manager asked of us and then he let us get wrapped up. LP held us both in a private interigation for almost 2 hours with the opposite sex, hounding us to admit what we did wrong, we only did what our store manager asked of us... HE WAS SO WRONG TO MANY OF US, PRETTY SAD"
good,The work was fast paced and typical of retail sales associates.  The hours declined as sales did.  There was high turnover.  There were managers that were helpful.
good,"the Good:"
good,If you were able to sell a good amount every week you could easily maintain a healthy life style. If you were unable to do so then it wasn't the best. The pay was all commission no hourly. Good sales were hard to come by with the people I worked with because it was very cut throat for the sales we had. They reduced pay considerably before I came around and many quit because of that.
good,Sales associate while I was in high school. Like working is the retail setting. It was fun coming to work and getting to help people. Left the job to focus on school full time.
good,"Management doesnt really care eve though they say the do"
good,"Never felt like a valued employee. Only and main concern was the numbers. I and my coworkers believed that with the economic changes the customer attendance fell. Somehow this was on us, not on the efforts outside the store. The people that work in the store were great, my major issue with the company was from a management point of view."
good,"It's a good place to work if you don't need money. You will for sure have to find a second job working here. No full time for anybody and lowest pay possible. I personally enjoyed my coworkers. But working here, you can see why they are going bankrupt."
good,Started off as a great company to work for then slowly started to treat commission sales staff worse as it came up with ideas in an attempt to save the company money. Commission rates started to dive bomb and training to sell new product came way after the new product was already made to be the main line.
good,"Each year brought less tangible benefits and more responsibilities. This continued each year as more employees were eliminated, departments shrunk in size and lines of merchandise were ended or inadequately stocked.   "
good,"Hardly and work actually needs to be done there as a retail position, no real effort is required for this job. Very easy going management, fun place to work regardless."
good,"Based on many factors my time with Sears is in the past. I spent a lot of time in a very fast pace, competitive environment that was very stressful."
good,"I worked for this company as delivering their monthly and seasonal catalogues. There weren't many opportunities to grow or get more work to do with this job considering it depended on who subscribed to the catalougues, in which who were needed to be delivered to."
good,"First office job, culture was very cut throat, no training or development opportunities. Job was slow paced and entry level positions only.  Advancement was not typical."
good,"The procedures for the job would change hourly sometimes even less time, making it hard to follow especiallly if you were at lunch when this happened."
good,"Sears is suffering financially and you can tell in the call center. O have been in 3 different departments since I started working there. The first department I worked in closed. I moved to another department because I could see it coming and didn't want to chance a lay off. The second department I worked for was closed and they laid us off. I didnt see thos one happening so soon but I was able to interview and got another position in out case management department. This role is more stressful then the others and pays less then it should for this role. The benefits offered are to expensive for the amount paid. The vacation time recurred is so little per the amount of time you work, it would take a year to maybe get a week of paid time."
good,unfortunately a lot of the shifts would go to the ones that the management liked first and then the rest went to everyone else. Not enough of people for the whole day to cover all areas ro shifts so you spend a lot of time covering other areas.
good,"The job itself isn't too bad, its fair and is usually well within means to achieve goals provided. Depending on the store, at times staff would be over-utilized for positions beyond their job description. At times management would favor veteran employees over new hires in terms of working hours and opportunities. The best part about working here are the other non-management employees as it was always like family. The worst was the internal politics used to bully leads and other management roles into performing a certain way."
good,The department manager yelled. I could never get on his good side if he had one. I was doing the best I could it was never enough. There was always something to be yelled about.
good,"over see all in coming and out going shipments and work on building repairs painting, lights ,wood working, flooring , plumbing , computer  and cash wraps set up ."
good,"Working at Sears was ""easy"".  However, it quickly became boring.  What drove me nuts was that I was expected to offer the Sears Mastercard to each and every customer, and even if they didn't want it I wasn't supposed to accept ""no""as an answer.  "
good,customer service issues all day with my position as assistant store manager. Fast pace for member assistance. A lot of store comparing with sales within the districts.
good,Learned how to deal with customers. How to keep up and organized an entire department. Beast part of the job when you got to help that great attitude persons.
good,"Store was performing well and company owned the store so no lease but still got out on closure list. Sales are going through the roof at closing stores while other bigger stores can't make 50% of their daily sales. The SM is not a leader,he is low down and has and is stealing from the company."
good,"company doesn't value associates, low pay. meet come cool people. management is hit or miss. no job security with the company. workplace culture always changes"
good,"I worked at Sears for two years and I learned how to provide excellent customer service to customers that needed help. I was advanced to being a cashier team leader because was able to get along with others, and trustworthy to monies of accounts and receivables."
good,"Great managers but little communication between decision maker and front line. "
good,"The first year at sears was great, but the second years the writing was on the wall that things were going downhill fast.  Upper management spending millions of dollars trying to fix the damage done over the years, and cutting salaries of the store management.  District Managers coming to town threatening and ridiculing you."
good,start the day by opening all registers and counting all the funds to make sure they are right  also getting credit applications ready for customers to fill out and submit
good,"This was my first job in retail and it shed a light on how it works on and off the floor. Typical work day was non stressful though I worked in the back of the store and my days were usually planned out. The workplace was great everyone was friendly and everybody helped one another, goes for some of the managers that were present. Though the job security might be a issue nowadays with the company closing down some stores."
good,the biggest lie of my life but did provide me with skills and understanding far beyond most other job enviroments and wouldnt go back on it but they push flaud customer service with high end product
good,"Sears was set hours , there was always plenty to do. It was a good place to work except for the low pay.. They never layed off really, as long as you're a good worker. Usually had a good crew to work with,"
good,use to be a fun place to work but customer numbers have dropped big in the past 5 years and some weeks its hard to make a living on straight commition
good,"I have been working at sears for over 6 months now,  and while I love working there, I can't survive off of it, As each paycheck goes by, I get less and less hours. My paycheck went from averaging $250 a pay period to less than $50 a pay period. So, basically, its a good job if the store is closing, I've gotten more hours than ever because our store is closing, or just starting out until they overhire. That's when you need to get out."
good,"The Consultative Sales Associate is responsible for enhancing the experience of customers and driving profitable sales by providing proactive consultative sales assistance and support to the customer, achieving department standards and goals, and performing sales-support activities to maintain a clean, in-stock, orderly and well-merchandised sales floor for conducting sales activities."
good,good place to work and you knew your daily responsibilities each day before your shift started. The employess who you worked with were very kind and aware of any help needed by you or any other co-worker and offered the help when needed.
good,A typical day at sears can be busy or slow. there is always something to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people we have lots of fun while working.
good,"A typical day working as an MCA at Sears consists of continuous folding of clothes, returning items to their rightful place, helping fellow employees/cashiers with whatever they need help with, and overall making sure the store is presentable. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep every clothing item folded neatly while customers would come in and unfold and misplace them. The most enjoyable part of working at Sears was working as a team to get the hard tasks completed."
good,Long hours in the summer 50-60 hrs a week. But 25-30 in the winter months in the NC coast area. No advertising for winter check ups just send you home when they ran out of work. Tough to survive with a family with no real pay stability. And all they want you to do is sell something to the customer not fix anything.
good,The location that I worked at closed because the company was doing an overhaul. They ended up turning all Hardware locations into outlets and relocated and retrained the employees.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job I get to talk to the customers they make you feel important and they tell you what a great job you're doing, good to"
good,Sears Home Services exemplifies an Entrepreneurial Culture focused on empowering Corporate and Franchise Branches to succeed by providing the appropriate level of Resources.
good,Must be very flexible as priorities change frequently. Changing work environment can be challenging at times. Lots of time spent in meetings. Most enjoyable are the people and teams you work with.
good,It's OK job but not enough pay for a heavy lifting job that I do . I unload trucks with a two wheel dolly  like merchandise like friges stoves washers dryers.
good,"I work at the Sears in Wilmington, NC. Most of the people that I work with on a daily basis are fun and enjoyable, but as everywhere else you can not always make everyone happy."
good,"sears has been steadily declining and closing stores and laying off workers, not investing in employee growth  due to closings I never received a raise after 4 years of great performance"
good,"I was mainly hired on as a seasonal employee, I helped with renovating the store's new location and moved a lot of heavy furniture. I hit my head pretty hard against a low wall and was told to 'walk it off' without so much as a second glance, even with the huge bump on the back of my head afterwards..."
good,"Sears has been a great place to learn the ins and outs of retail in a large company environment. However, constant turnover of management with ever-changing direction makes for a hard work environment."
good,nothing nice to say about that workplace. management wasn't that great . they did not care about the employees life outside of the work place. They dont care if you are sick or in pain.
good,Good job for teens or adults to start their retail experience and use as a springboard to bigger locations or other companies.  Seasonal work is the way to get into the field.
good,"Worked for the company 10 years. Had a new manager every 6 months or so. Company has declined drastically over the years. Would not recommend for a career, but a starting point."
good,"As a load planner I have to coordinate routes, get approval with the carrier, saving cost. Assign employees load to work on and make sure everything fit and the right order of delivery. confirm with carrier when is delivered and send bill of landing to the multiples warehouse and stores."
good,"This was a good job for a student, but the pay was bad, they still did base+ commission which was good and bad because wages were never stable. The store I was at had low traffic and we had to take advantage of people calling off in other departments to try and make a buck."
good,"es una buena empresa, solo que se paga muy poco la comisión, y son altas las cuotas y el precio de lo que vendes para lo poco que recibes de sueldo, y el horario es otro factor"
good,Tough company to work for these days with the ever changing environment in the brick and mortar retail world. Current CEO took over the company back in 2006 and didn't have a retail back ground and unfortunately it shows in the decision making processes.
good,The company is struggling badly and cutting back on employees and stores. The management team is really good and do the best with what they can. Fellow co workers are great.
good,I worked with some of the best people in the world we were all like family.  I was very sad when the store closed.  It hurts my heart everytime I hear of another store is closing.  All so the CEO can make another dollar in his pocket!
good,"Some departments seem to enjoy their jobs. AP Management was awful when I was there, don't even bother if you want to eventually get promoted - you have to be friends with them or ""friends with benefits."" There's plenty better AP jobs out there, believe me."
good,"Due to the fact that Sears was under construction. and then it went into bankruptcy the atmosphere was intense. The management was hectic; however, my coworkers made it worth while. It was a great experience, I learned how to work in a high-pace environment. I also learned to work with difficult customers, and make the best of the situation we were all in."
good,"I enjoyed the job security I had at Sears."
good,"Simple work, easy to ask for days off, management was not around much, very laid back and you are pretty independent while working your shift. Basic retail responsibilities."
good,Fun place to work and stretch your legs.  Relaxed environment and work were never too hard.  Worked in the loading/stocking area of the store and always kept busy.
good,Enjoyed working there for the time I was there. Just needed to move forward I'm life and make more money and work towards a long term career.  I did learn alot from there.  Listening to people and work on people skills
good,"As a seasonal cashier, I didn't get to experience much of the culture at Sear's, but the people I met were very friendly and welcoming into their environment."
good,"Was ""guaranteed"" 2-3 daily appointments - ended up being closer to 5 appointments a week, and many of those required 1-1/2 - 3-hour drives."
good,"Never had any performance reviews, even after working almost a year and a half. Management in HR don't seem interested in the morale of their employees. On a good note, there are some really good employees that made my time there tolerable."
good,"I presently work in RTV I am responsible for all store returns and make determinations if the merchandise can be sold at a lower price or if I send back to the Central Return Center (CRC)>The 1st task of my day is to collect all returns thru the registers from the day before.We have two types of returns hardlines and softlines depending on the merchandise will determine my disposition of the items."
good,Job assignment was very short there because they shut down the department i was managing. I wasn't given enough time to gain significant supervisory experience.
good,"Asistir a junta diaria, recibir mercancía, acomodo de ella, atender a clientes, hacer labor de venta de tarjeta departamental, sierre de venta,cobro de mercancía o recibir pago de tarjeta."
good,"Job was not difficult to do, a lot of repetitive work."
good,"This job required you to replenish stock, set up new displays, set up new signage, reprice items, set up new sales adds and keep the floor and dressing rooms organized."
good,Hourly and commission sales job. Bad/lazy employees would try and steal commission sales then accuse other of sales stealing. Very cut throat hostile work environment.
good,"Pay is low - $8.25"
good,"Fun place to work, co workers are always great when they show up for work. Hours kinda suck and the pay isn't the greateas. But if you need a job then this place is good for that."
good,"It was really easy , didn't do much but I got paid minimum which was 10.50 but the managers were all over the place seems as if they had no idea what they were doing"
good,"The main store manager only cares about credits and numbers, and not enough about customer service and the employees. We had to harass a customer 3 times about signing up for a sears credit card and are usually put under observation when we don't."
good,"working stock is hands down the easiest job in sears, if its a slow day you really can kick back and take it easy unless the person in charge likes to micromanage things."
good,"I spent about a year working in Kmart (part of Sears at that point), and enjoyed my time. My store was a big family, and we all worked to support each other. Corporate is corporate, and rarely understands what is happening at the store-level, but that's pretty constant across most retail."
good,It was holiday rush but I don't hold that against the company management could use a little work. Getting around was easy however they are using retail equipment that should have been replaced long ago.
good,It's been awhile since I've worked at Sears.  The best part about the job was being able to pick up extra hours and the ability to work a 6:00 to 3:00 shift.
good,Enjoyable people to work with (fellow associates) love environment (customer) Store Management really does  not have a say on how the company should be run.
good,Sears is on it's way out of the retail business. Not a place to work their is no loyalty.  Hours are mostly weekends and night for new assoicates.  Pay is very low to other retail positions.
good,"Sometimes this job can be very slow. Especially after the holidays. Hours get cut severely. Although during the holidays, hours are plentiful. Sears is also understaffed, so sometimes the job can be hard. In my opinion, management could be better."
good,A typical day is busy long lines with maybe at least one person on the register at once and you have to be fast paced or you're not going to be able to handle the job.
good,"Initially Sears provided proper training, a diversity of employees, and responsible / respected management. The final year,all changed as customers no longer mattered & bottom line was actually close to unethical."
good,"A typical day at work was between 5 and 8 hours. I learned different things about mattresses and box springs, vacuums, microwaves and furniture. Management was very decent, although had a major lack of understanding and support. The culture at sears was fun and laid back. The hardest part of the job was having to stay with my sales so as my coworker wouldn't take over to steal them. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people, always being on my feet and getting to know and work with my coworkers."
good,"I haven't worked at Sears for eight years so I am not sure if I would recommend it. If someone is looking for a career which they get earn decent money and advance in then Sears is not the place. However, it is good for high school kids and a part time, second job. The schedule can be difficult."
good,I didn't see myself growing in this company. The management is unprofessional and i had no benefits. They do not care about their employees due to the fact that they took away our associate discount because the company is running out of business.
good,"J'accueillais les personnes qui venait prendre des photos;"
good,The people I worked with were cool people to work with.  The actual work performance standards however are ridiculously high.  Especially for a home appliance store.
good,was a nice place to work. however they cared more about the selling of Sears credit cards more so than actual customer service. shortly after i relocated to the DMV area.
good,Sons had stuff that I needed to attend and manager didn't do his job of finding a way to make it work I had to. Sells started as a optional now it is mandatory.
good,"management was hit or miss. The higher the manager the less capable they seemed to be at understanding the people and their customers. Sad to see that a lot of our customers were older or recommended to come see us by their parent or grandparent who remember the once great company. Retail Hours, commission base pay."
good,I have worked at Sears for almost 7 years. This is a good place to work if you like people you work with but raises are few and far between. I have received only 1 raise my entire time working there and I have even been a candidate for their GEM ( growing entry management program). Good Job for a high-school or college student but not to make a career out of.
good,Good work experience with customers. Unfair management taking others commissions from other associates who sold to customers. Being able to have long shifts because of my drive distance. Driving and delivering was interesting but stressful.
good,Sears holdings is a great job with a fast paced atmosphere with challenging tasks daily.  Peers are great people with good work ethics who believe in teamwork. I was able to work in several different departments in their headquarters and always took away great learnings and capabilities. Traveling the United States was the most enjoyable part of my job providing training and establishing standards.
good,"Things are tough with the current financial condition of the company."
good,"I have worked for Sears for over 4 years. I was forced to move to different departments multiple times to fulfill staffing needs. 3 of my 5 direct supervisors during my time at Sears were great leaders, the others didn't care how hard you tried. Management will always scold you on your negative aspects instead of focusing on your good achievements. There is a constant threat of your store closing due to lack of profitability. As an appliance sales associate, I earned no hourly wage and worked strictly on commission, which was minimal and I rarely made more than minimum wage on average during a full-time work week."
good,"Company is slowly dying. Pay is not great Unless you have a very active store or work in the appliance area. Easy work but not fulfilling."
good,Going under fast. The company changed so many things in the past couple years that were not beneficial to the company succeeding in the future. Took away employee discount at point of sale.
good,"I truly liked my job at one point, but the lack of staff makes it difficult and upsetting; singular associates in specific departments are now expected to work all over and take on any and every task. Being qualified to work in every department is one thing, but actually doing the work for multiple departments on top of your own is mentally and physically exhausting. Due to the lack of staff, I'm forced to work longer shifts and tasks that were once crucial to my specific area have fallen by the wayside as I've been tasked to also take care of several others. The pay is pretty low, and management is flakey, one day a manager is here and the other they've already been replaced."
good,"was good job,but the pgreat,,ay and hrs was too short,managwer not that ,,,,,,,,benefit none,and not full time just 30 hrs only,,,,,,the discount was only ten porcent"
good,"I enjoyed working with customers. I was able to start inventory procedures and documentation. The typical day would consist of unloading freight, stocking and assisting customers"
good,I have worked with Sears Corp for over 10 years. I loved my job yes but they do not care about their people. I relocated for them and not even a year later they closed my store and they had not a care in the world .
good,"Managment are bullies, and use threats to keep you going. What makes it barable to work there are your fellow coworkers who turn out to be more like family."
good,"Very stressfull job ,this department doesnt have established a way of doing the job,rules and procedures continually change. You are a number for them."
good,sears outlet is most of the time slow paced. the phone rings constant and I must always answer no matter what I am doing. if it gets too busy I have to go and help the sales associate.
good,"Sears Auto Center was a part time job i took. I perfomed oil changes, battery changes, and tire changes/repairs. I also help keep the shop clean and the stock room in order. I worked less than 20 hours a week, and this store went thru many manager changes so it hard to give an description."
good,I worked a temporary position at minimum wage since it was a closing store. It was entry level and they taught me a lot. Actually helped me get my next job.
good,"Sears is dying, don't work here.  I spent more time standing around doing nothing than actual work.  Plus, the commission they give to their appliance salespeople is a joke."
good,Was working there almost 2 yrs worked 6 days a week only 35 hr not 40 no overtime or sick days advancements do not happen often even if worked hard fir it
good,"stressful day dealing with certain customers, slow traffic means you aren't making money since I was on commission. I learned a lot of information on appliances and customer service. Hardest part is patience with an angry customer and the easiest part of that job was ringing up a sale."
good,"•	Provide vision, management and direction for hourly associates "
good,"If you pickup things on your own real well, you might like the job. However, I found that the training I received did not prepare me to work on the appliances we found needing repairs. Some of the guys we worked with were great, however there were only a couple that really were willing and able to help out and they got over used. The phone-in help line was more often than not, worthless if not down right rude to you. No matter what they say, you are out there all alone and have to just figure it out or figure out how to get away from it today... did not feel like I was able to accomplish much. The pressure for doing sales vs. repairs was kind of insane."
good,The pay is very bad. They do not promote within very often. The benefits are decent if you manage to get full time. The management however tends to try and degrade you if you don't meet expectations one week.
good,Worked for 5 years and not so good experience as they have a very poor management. Micro Management and some employees are not very friendly and helpful.
good,"average day was fine, but it has been over 15 years since employed. Manager was fine. Worked with great people who worked hard. Felt that there was favoritism shown."
good,The company was once the leader of retail in the United States.  It has been sad to watch Sears slowly wither on the vine.  The company is a shadow of it's former self.
good,"it was ok, great place to hangout with coworkers and talk since no customers shop at sears anymore, pay/commission was not very good, made some great lifelong friends while working there, great people to meet."
good,Was ok in the beginning until corporate cuts came down. Was running a store with bare number of employees which managers had to cover departments and cashiers as well as doing management duties and assisting customers. Became extremely stressful.
good,i really enjoyed the bonuses they gave us for the hard work. they hardest part of the job was learning specs about items. it was a lot of competition in the workplace.
good,"I did not particularly enjoy working here, I refolded a lot of clothes and worked off a computer the size of me. There wasnt anywhere to go from there."
good,"Great company, sad to see it's financial situation. Was once the leader in retail and appliance and home improvement sales in the world, but has allowed the competitors to steal market share."
good,"The people are Sears were great and very nice. However, the management was not that great. For example, the hours were not fair and the managers were not very clear on the tasks they wanted to be done."
good,verry nice experienc but no money!! did it becAUSE IT WAS MY PASSION
good,Well with over 30 years with a awesome company Sears the company has been good to me and my family. I am ready for a change and if given the opportunity to meet new people and share my working experience with a new company.
good,"Company in process of closing stores."
good,"Company is on the decline.  Not much is spent to re-invest in their facilities and equipment.  Business model cannot be sustained for much longer.  Enjoyed the people, but not much of a future."
good,"Good place to work but little opportunity to advance. Uncertain about the company health. OK benefits if full time but few full time positions available,"
good,"Sears is a fantastic place to start a career in HVAC service..."
good,Great place to work for entry level management or beginners> Worked for Sears twice in life. Once as a cashier and then back as management. Company makes changes that affects employees and their lively hood
good,"Staffing was friendly and supportive, but the position was short lived. I started with the company just before the made the change back to Kmart. I did not like the fact that it was a commission based position."
good,First time working for costumer service learned how to work cash register a really great experience got to learn a lot about tools and appliances and really like my co workers and managers
good,"Lack of customers, poor management only one out of four managers knows what they doing and how to run the store properly, good and friendly co-workers"
good,"On a normal day, you interact with a plethora of customers and are generally given a few tasks to take care of that are not limited to solving customer issues, locating items, or assisting in cashiering to ensure the customer receives a pleasant shopping experience."
good,"Working at Sears on a typical day is pretty chill once you know the people you're working with and what you're doing. From my time at sears I've learned a lot of life lessons like, communicating better, teamwork, and that everything doesn't always go according to plan so you have to adapt."
good,ran the office everyday was different. learned all computer systems. Management was not on sight. most enjoyable about the job was to learn to work on appliances
good,"Overall relaxed environment, and can wear casual attire on typical days. Inefficient management--take credit for everyone else's work after dumping their work on subordinates."
good,"Management is one of the worst i've ever encountered with."
good,"All Sears cares about is getting Credit Apps, Protection Agreements.  They try to tell you both equals sales. Very bad culture from district managers."
good,The pay is 7 dollars an hour plus commission.  You can't make commission without personally processing customer sales.  The assistant manager and manager would process customers during the mornings and have me come in starting late mornings.  By late morning most customers were processed for the day.  There were not enough mechanics to have too many customers per day.  So business was slow during the remainder of the day.  This meant I generally earned only the seven dollars per hour.  I had to leave because I could not afford to work there.  They would have me use my own vehicle to pick up parts and deliver products to businesses.  They told me it was up to me to advertise for Sears to bring customers into the Auto Center.  I spent over a hundred dollars of my own money to do this. It made no difference and there were not enough mechanics on staff to handle the customers they had.
good,I stocked new merchandise coming in making sure my area was clean and safe for the customers to shop. I also helped customers find what they were looking for while encouraging them to try some of the new items that came in. I helped in other departments when they were short handed and i could be spared from my area. I also ran a register and answered phone calls.
good,learning skills the hardest part was dealing with unorganized workers          enjoyed working with customers learning how to handle  money  and have patience
good,"I have learned a lot from my Sears experience, everything from sales to supply chain management. While working here I learned a lot about customer relations and how to cooperate with people in the workplace."
good,"At Sears , I was cleaning and fixing home appliances which were kind of dusty or worn out due to transport ,movements, or shelf time or returns. Make them clean and neat and mechanically functioning well. The hardest part of the job is to make sure I meet the quota/ number of items that must be finished each day. "
good,Make sure everything is neat and help customers. Co-workers there are friendly everyone gets along. All employees help each other when one needs help. The main manager is nice and helps out.
good,"The individuals I was in contact with were good people who did their jobs.  As Sears is a failing company, structural aspects make it a bad job overall."
good,It was a great place to start working for me becaz i had just graduated and i was getting paid for lifting Refrigerators and stove tops all day but the management was a lil tough on me even for a first time worker.
good,"The location I work at has a fun environment, but the hours available vary from week to week. There is not enough man power to cover the processes they require to be done."
good,"start out running and keep it up all day!! I learned quite a bit about clothing,men's denim in particular,Our management team was Fantastic!! Teamwork is what makes it work!! The hardest part of the job was realizing that people are NOT raised to ""do unto others"" as I was,Men women,teens kids, doesn't matter ,NO one can put the clothing back where they got it from or even pick it up off the fitting room floor.Most of our particular store's members could not even manage to find a garbage can for the stuff the brought in from the food court--just dump it on the floor or leave it on a table,But as a team we all had it looking good at close to do all over again the next day!!"
good,"I was a shoe consultant. I found it fun to find shoes for people. It was very slow but the management was very helpful and caring about your personal life. Unfortunately, the store is closed though."
good,Sears is trying hard to become a technology company but they are struggling with it because they do not have proper guidance from their top leadership.
good,"I was a sale associate I help customer pick out a item they are looking for, ringing the item up so they can buy it, Also I would folding clothes and put away were they go, and also cleaning outfitting room that people do not want to buy, Also  my boss in the children department  teach me how to do mark on winter clothes"
good,Sears was a good company for a person just entering the working field or for a retired person. Sears has faded out from the Cleveland areas and one must relocate to seek employment with this company. Overall fun place to work.
good,Management should be better in terms of work distribution among team members.To grow as a team need proper resources and approach which is still on which they have to focus.
good,"Due to the financial crisis Sears has many issues with staffing levels, eliminating job functions and day to day operations.  The work life balance is very poor.  Financial rewards are sparse and employees cannot count on annual raises, bonuses or matching contributions from corporate."
good,The work is a bit difficult because it consists of unloading and to load appliances often heavy electrical appliances. The company is seeking efficiency and reductions in labour costs.
good,Was hired as washer/dryer repair. Was not giving adequate training as a result was demoted to PM check all appliances. Dispatching route was terrible.
good,3 weeks into my job at Sears it was announced that it would be closing sometime in the future. For the next 3 months we were afraid they would close immediately without notice. Altogether the experience wasn't so bad. The comradery of being in such a situation produced a unique culture I doubt I would have found anywhere else.
good,"Relaxed environment, but Managements wok/life balance is non-existent.  I enjoyed the activities that we hosted for each advisor and the feeling of camaraderie among everyone."
good,The hours for the job had declined so fast that people were only getting 6 hours a week of work or less. The place was falling apart. Even the opening and closing hours were minimized from 12 PM to 7/8 PM because it was not selling.
good,There is no job security and you always feel as if you are expendable at any moment. Senior management ridicule and belittling you as a way to motivate.
good,Great place to get solid training to move on to more lucrative centers...  Sears Call Center will give you what you need to succeed in the call center world most definitely.
good,"Working at the service desk was stressful at times, trying to calm angry customers wasn't always easy, I had to think of solutions on the spot that would satisfy everyone involved. Sometimes there was some lack of communication between employees and management that made it stressful to get the job done. Some new managers came in and better organized how the company was being ran which made it a lot easier."
good,working at sears is okay. management is okay. not enough hours. no place for advancement. no raises what so ever. super slow and repetitive. did same thing every day.
good,sears is the most quietest store I ever worked at but the other employees and managers are nice and the tools are of the best Quality if your a handyman
good,"I would recommend this part time job to students who do not have to support themselves or people who are already retired and would like something to do. Though the main supervisor at my particular workplace was at times unprofessional "
good,While working here the management was not worth the amount that was being paid. the employees were much better than the management. I would not work at this location again.
good,"Management takes employee concerns very seriously but are not always accommodating to employee needs. However, the organizational culture is excellent and it is a safe and fun workplace environment."
good,"High stress environment,high pressure to perform to standard of metrics.upper management are out of touch with expectations .lower level managers do all of the work"
good,"Not a very professional company to grow with. I would not advise anyone to apply to this place, because of the experience I had working there. Issues with several different factors, such as favoritism, racism, and lack of true structure."
good,Working at Kmart is not a fast paced environment. Very repetitive. Pretty good with a flexible schedule and understanding if you had a emergency come up. It's a good summer job but defiantly not something you would want to make a living from. The schedules aren't the best. Some weeks you will work less then 10 hours a week and the next you will work 30 hours. Most of the shifts are 5-7 hours and the schedules change to frequently.
good,"I had a great time working at Sears. I learned a lot of valuable skills I still use today, as it comes with working with a Fortune 500 company. It's great to have on your resume but not the ideal place to have a career. Unfortunately, corporate has a stranglehold on all the individual stores, which makes it virtually impossible to advance, even for your boss. Luckily the staff all knows we are in this sinking ship together, and it creates a sense of family unity that I miss even today."
good,"A typical day included unloading merchandise from the truck, opening boxes and bringing product to the sales floor for stocking shelves and racks. Also waiting on customers who came to the merchandise pick-up kiosk for items that they purchased. The hardest part of the job was working in a warehouse space too small for what was in it. The best part was when they had an outside warehouse with more room."
good,The environment was very slow. Work flow had no toom to grow. I'd rather much work in a active environment. Coworkers were not very helpful. Overall it was a temporary job.
good,Working stock is always busy but if you enjoy hard work Sears gives it to you. There is a lot of heavy lifting involved in merchandising and you will always have something to do.
good,"Great people work there, but the company is declining quickly. Store environment was great, customers were great, but there isn't much of a career potential within the company."
good,"Gained strong versatile retail, customer service, and management experience. Compensation was very low. Very difficult to survive on retail salary. Very little room for advancement, tough to make a career. Very long and exhausting hours."
good,"a fun environment to learn and develop management skills while learning about the basic ""how to"" needs of the common household.  I learned a great deal about basic household repairs and techniques."
good,Sears is not the same. The company has taken a turn for the worst. The upper management needs to wake up if they expect to be in business ten years from now. It is sad for me to say because when I was there things at least going in the right direction.
good,This job was sales based with a base salary plus commission. The managers were slightly deceptive such as telling other people things that were sworn to be kept confidential
good,slow work days with not enough work to keep you busy. I didn't really learn much from this job. the management was okay there were some good managers with positive fun attitudes.
good,"commission structure has changed for the worse due to declining sales and foot traffic in stores,Most of the business has gone online.There is a lot of competition in this market.Online sales associates do not ern  a commission for their services.It is better to purchase a product you can touch and feel and have personal connection/ contact with a store associate should any concerns arise from their purchase."
good,"Not for the timid . Long days and hard work. Leads not always great  and sales come in streaks. Evening appointments are long . Mileage reimbursement helps but a lot of driving time and down time between appointments,"
good,Enjoyed working with the same people for years. Hardest part of the job was teaching customers about products who would take that knowledge and buy merchandise somewhere else.
good,It was ok being a commisioned sales person at Sears but the company would cut commissions every year so it was hard to make a living wage.
good,"Busy work schedule with school"
good,". MORAL IS DYING WITH PROFIT if you seek long term stability keep looking.  "
good,Good work environment. Long work days. Learned about self improvement. Hardest part is going to other people's homes.
good,"Meet the customers needs and try to serve the best I could. I would be at the register at times."
good,ehh.. its a job really. at times can be good depending which department you are in but like any place they are pros and cons.
good,The store had no structure. The employees thought the could do whatever they wanted when they wanted. The managers got walked all over because they where afraid to mot me liked. There was no good communication or training for the job.
good,"I made good money, but the job was hard.  I had to lift very heavy furniture, and ending up hurting my back.  I actually enjoyed cleaning the carpet and tile."
good,"My job was to contact homeowners to set up an appointment for home improvement services. I learned about roofing, windows and interior and exterior doors for homes.  The management staff were awesome to work with.The job wasn't hard at all. It was a fun work environment for everyone.  Very enjoyable place to work"
good,"Dias poco agetriados"
good,The store is a family oriented feel and it's easy to get along with every coworker. Sales is the only position that can potentially make money but there is no consistency in making sales. The Appliance and Hardware store is one of the biggest selling stores but there is a ceiling for growth within. Good job for a younger person who wants to learn sales and customer service.
good,"I didn't work directly for SEARS per say, we were an outside contractor that sported SEARS shirts, pay was okay but the demand for carpet and upholstry cleaning is shrinking, and smaller outfits like this cant afford newer trucks,"
good,"This was my first job in the automotive field. I received this job while I was still in college, and the work scheduling was flexible. Unfortunately with Sears closing many stores, the store I worked at was one of them. I left after about a year and a half."
good,Not too fond of sears but it worked for me during the time I was there. My hours were very unstable and I started to look for work else when when I started to be scheduled for 8 hours a week. A waste of my time and gas!
good,"Just read the news. Sears is struggling and I need to find employment. There is not much more to tell about Sears. I have worked here starting on my 13th year,"
good,"The overall experience that I had with Sears Company was that it lacked a strong leadership from the managers and consistency with hours.  The pay that I received was not consistent with the hours, and it tended to be very confusing with no clarification."
good,They hired to few employees which put most of the work is put on the few employees that work there. Compensation is subpar for the amount of work being done.
good,"nice place to work part time. Few hours, stand on your feet 4 to 8 hours. Available weekends and must on holidays. must like to work with public and sales floor. work well with others."
good,"Started my senior year of high school and they really work with your schedule. Some of the managers are not the best. They often trust the wrong people and reward them, so the people who do shady stuff do get results are the ones who get promoted."
good,"Most of my co-workers where great people and I did not have any issues with management. The main issue was compensation, to little pay for the work performed on a night shift. Management doesn't value the family sacrifice or the strain on the body working nights."
good,"The company which i worked with is a place where you feel low self esteem, they do not encourage people to learn, i usually do the same stuffs from the start of my employment until now , they always let you work the usuals and it makes you feel low and unmotivated, some managers have favorites and of course they are the once who received the mst hours regardless, i worked there for many years.   The company has a bad management when it comes to treating associates fairly  and honestly,  i will never return there anymore."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of loading and unloading semis while trying to assist guest that would come in for merchandise pick-ups. Although this may seem easy, it almost seemed impossible because of the fact that we were often times understaffed and asked to help others in different areas of the store do their work as well. $8.25 simply was not worth it in my opinion."
good,"I applied here because it was close to home. I liked the hours I initally requested but was asked to work for Merchandising as it was required by all employees. Some days I was scheduled to work from 4pm-9pm then had to be back at the store for merch at 6AM. Be prepared to be asked to come in on your day off or stay later."
good,I work on comission here and lose sales all the time because of disorganization in the company plus i then have to deal with the angry customer after we as a company mess something up so it gets quite frustrating at times
good,"Sears has been a great place to work.  I have learned and been licensed to drive all equipment and work in every aspect of warehouse work.   However, I need a job in a more stable environment."
good,not bad.  a lot of staff turn over. they try to work with minimal staff which leads to large staff turn over and staff burnout.
good,Managers expects a lot more than you get paid for. Sometimes makes you work 12+ and sometimes do not let you work more than 2-3 hours. Poor management.
good,"Sears is a place to work for a while, but not to make a career.  The benefits are not good, and the pay is not good either.  Too much is expected for the pay."
good,"There are opportunities to advance, but work hours change daily. You must be very flexible to their schedule. If your time is flexible, then you will have no problems working here."
good,In retail you work long hours and the work life balanace is difficult due to the sales revolvinng around Holidays. It had its rewards and challenges. When I first started there it was a great place to work and move up. But as the economy started to slide so did the morale of the company and the cuts. They started takign away benefits and hours of employees and started requiring more from the current employees. The hardest part was the work life balance. The most enoyable was the employees and the relationships you build.
good,It was a good place to work. The people I worked with were friendly and we all worked well together.  Management was not always fair.  There just wasn't a way to grow.
good,"I loved the company and my former co-workers, I enjoyed and the job but sometimes you need to let go of something to be able to develop yourself more."
good,"I loved being in visual because I learned so many different facets of the job like painting, building glass cubes and displays. I loved changing mannequins and creating designs for projects."
good,"Management usually unclear as to direction, except for credit apps and people signed up for shop your way. Overall, the decline of Sears/Kmart makes sense. Find another job, and I am looking."
good,"Work days are long"
good,"Sears was a nice place to works.  At times, some customers were unreasonable, but they were the exception.  Most were very nice.  My bosses were very nice and I learned much from them."
good,"The job started off pretty great, things started to fall down hill when new management came in. And the pushing of trying to get us to ring people up on Ipads."
good,A typical day consists of putting new merchandise out on racks. Setting up new displays and taking down old ones. Putting up and taking down signs. Ringing on a register. I learned how to decorate my home and how to look for quality. Management was ok. I liked my supervisors at the time. Co-workers are still friends of mine. The hardest part of the job was trying to make the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting ready for the holidays.
good,"it was fun place to work for,8 to 10 service calls per day meet new people every day fix all kind of appliances always learning new problem and new challangs"
good,Great people to work with and for. Current company situation is unstable and long term is uncertain. They have closed over 300 stores this year and are closing more by the end of the year. Uncertain about their future.
good,Low moral in the store because of store manager. Staff does not enjoy being at work due to poor management from the store manager.
good,"Once holiday hours are gone most hours go to management, its hard to move up with sears and too much depends on the little work they give you. Most shifts worked alone there was too much to do with not enough time. Management doesnt really listen to employees, and their communication needs work."
good,the culture was based on fear and they treated people badly.  My impression is that the CEO is a Real Estate broker and could care less about the customer or retail.
good,While working at Sears I worked consistently. Everyday was different and I learned about a new product and what it was capable of or learned something new about a tool that I was already familiar with. You get a lot of experience and training in sales and which does a lot to build overall confidence and self-esteem. You mix with very diverse coworkers. It sometimes gets hard dealing with the change of pace when the seasons change and the demand from management raises. But the pay off afterwards is very rewarding.
good,"Not a good company to work for, no pay raises and no room to advance. This company cannot keep employees, always new help. The few employees that stay there, the company does not pay them well enough."
good,I felt very taken advantage of by the owner of this company. I was promised many things that never came to pass. I felt like I offered strong leadership and strong sales growth yet I never received compensation for my efforts other than a very small base salary. That being said the job did offer me some opportunities  and challenges to grow professionally.
good,"Easy to learn job duties easy to order parts from auto stores. Worked with on sales floor. Learned to change ties, balance tires, and patch up tires. Easy to work with co-workers"
good,Very poor job advancement.  Lack of Appreciation of your Job.  Unable to meet CEO.  Did not give Landsend stock during the spinoff for the 401(k) accounts
good,very fast have to be ready at all times for anything from driving across state to getting off early co-workers are great hardest part of the job is the paper work and most enjoyable is the customers
good,sears good place to worl part time but ttheres no order its disorganised employees are miserable they dont increase salaries its gabbage company to work at
good,"Great group of people and a fast paced place to work.  "
good,"Sears is a great place to work for any high school or college student. You can make decent money and have fun. Employees were fun to work with, however management had some issues. Other than that it is a great place to work and it pays good."
good,Management has its favorites...not much more to state. However the work place is nice and calm and easy to be in.
good,"I learned quite a bit training on the computer for all aspects of my job.  When I was given work, I enjoyed my day with customers and co-workers.  The most rewarding part was assisting customers with opening a credit card.  The hardest part was not being compensated for each credit card.  You had to meet a quota."
good,Enjoy the job; learned more excel procedures and gained computer skills.  Would prefer more capable management and better chance of advancement.  Co-workers are fine but would like more consistent and diversified day.
good,"Having worked for the company for over 10 years there has been a lot of change, some good some bad. I have some great coworkers and have had some good managers.  Recently the business has been going through a difficult period and working day to day has become more of a challenge."
good,"While a good place to work for, there is not a whole lot of available hours. There is a lot of heavy lifting in the CAWP department, though co-workers tend to be excellent. Most management will work with you for your needs."
good,"Job title is a Backroom associate for sears. I would handle some of the receiving processes for the store, assist customers with their repairs and help customers with some of their in-store and online purchases. Looking for something with more hours available."
good,"If you work in management you will literally kill yourself! First off you must understand that Sears as a company is lost in old standards. Like most people will tell you they've closed most of their physical locations due to more profitable Internet Sales. The company isn't going out of business by far. But if you unfortunately find yourself working in 1 of their locations. You will undoubtedly be overloaded in Daily operations and customer issues. The company truly has no clue what's going on in their company on the ground level. All they care about is ""Metrics"". The sales associates are they're golden gooses. All they want them to do IS SALE and nothing else. If you work in management you will be treated like a doormat by your sales associates and upper management will ignore every qualm you may have. Even when you actually take care of customers and do almost every task required of you and more in this multi million dollar operation. They act as if it's a mom and pop corner store. The pay does not out weigh all the frustrations and anxiety you will incur. Apply only if you wish for an early death!"
good,"Your were required to work weekends and all holidays, and always be ready last minuted. i am a hard workder and work whenever needed, but you never get compensated for your hard work. Worked there 2 1/2 yrs. and never received an increase."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at SEARS. I stayed there for so long for the experience of being a Manager. There was no career advancement there, salary could have been better considering some of the situations I encountered."
good,If you are looking for something temporary this is a good place but not for the long term.  Management is not very competent and promotions are not based on your ability to do the job. Raises are not  often and not very much. I did like the people and and enjoyed the employees but not the job itself. The company seems to be disorganized and lacks direction.
good,"they do not pay enough, and  barely give any hours. no breaks except  a 30 min lunch when you work over 5 hours. co-workers are pretty awesome, but no one really likes to help keep anthing cleaned up. hardest part is trying to get people to apply for credit cards, which required in order to keep your job."
good,It was probably the worst job ive ever had but I loved the employees. Low hours. No Job security . a typical day at work you did nothing and were by yourself most of the time
good,"Started as a great work environment, allot of new ideas and developed great collections.  Now thanks to multiple managerial changes and a smaller work force. Sears is still trying to find its place in today’s fast paced market trying to imitate fast fashion retailers with no success."
good,In my 6 plus months i have had 5 different managers and management is very unorganized. Typical day here involves assisting customers and loading or unloading trucks
good,"16 hours expected to be squeezed into 10."
good,"Enjoyable place to work overall, culture needs to change.  Management team needs to gain their associates respect  Management team needs to relate to associates.  Most of the time this place is understaffed and the management team is always backed up not having enough time to coach their new hires which makes room for frustrated employees.  Training should be more extensive and detailed.  A one week classroom would definitely help especially for those going into appliance sales.  The pay should be more competitive, it should mirror the city of Oakland pay rate.  For anyone who likes helping people get what they want, this is a good place to be.  It's often a challenge but it pays off as people see that you do everything in your power to accommodate their needs."
good,"Have to run many appointments, not much of a life outside of work. Constant changes from management because company is nationwide, every office follows the same processes and products."
good,Typical department store. Sales associates are commissioned while cashiers are hourly. Management can be pretty hit or miss depending on the department.
good,"SEARS, ont mal réagit face à L'arrivée des achats par internet et des magasins types Costco, Wall-Mart et autres, Ils choisirent de se départir de beaucoup de leurs actifs comme la carte de crédit Sears, leurs centres de distributions, leurs centres de service de réparation et installation, et de milliers d'employés expérimentés et qualifiés Ils ont renouvelé et réduit leurs personnel au minimum afin d'épargner salaires et avantages sociaux. Ils n'ont pas su utiliser leur fabuleux département du catalogue comme tremplin pour entrer adéquatement dans l'aire numérique,sans pénaliser leur personnel et la qualité du service qui était leur A.D.N."
good,The managers at Sears are very nice and understanding. Sometimes they can show favoritism to certain employees. They like to over work some employees and let the others get away with anything.
good,"The company is focus on short term plans, stop the bleeding now but not focusing on long terms company future. Without good plan just putting out fires every day, very reactive culture, too many management changes."
good,"As a company sears holdings is stores are usually very flexible with your schedule however hours fluctuate way too much. There is not much room for growth in the company, and pay is not very competitive."
good,"co-workers stick together, but company hurting no job security, too much change over of management at store level, not very good benefits"
good,i like the job but its closing so hours are rare management doesn't care anymore its a fun place to work tho. The Hours are nice i work about 5 hours a day i would like to work more then that tho.
good,"Responsible for departments displays, entering inventory, helping customers with purchases. Displays included jewelry and clothing, and making sure items were on the floor for customers to buy."
good,Structured negotiator on IT Online Procurement managing projects and agreements engaging with business units. Talented workforce and stakeholders willing to gain momentum in a difficult times for the organization. The most difficult part was not having goals/objectives defined prior to the year beginning.  Leadership failing to communicate with managers on company direction.
good,"A typical day at work requires a cashier to clean up around the work area, fix the clothes on the shelf, put back clothes that were not purchased, charge customers for the products they are purchasing, ask them if they want to apply for credit, ask them if they are members of the shop your way rewards program.  What I learned working here is that I never want to do it again. Management was alright depending on what manager you were stuck with.  There was a specific manager that would never give positive feedback, she would just constantly tell you what you were doing wrong. The co-workers were all nice. The hardest part of the job was getting people to apply for credit or for the shop your way rewards program and having it affect the amount of hours you were scheduled for work. Many people don't want to give you their personal information.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
good,There are a lot of great people working for this company at the store level trying to make things better but upper management is insistent on micro-managing the stores to death; too many processes that are just irrelevant.  Upper management has completely lost touch with the value of good people in the stores and just what motivates employees.
good,Pay system is very much flawed in many ways and compensation isn't very good if you're an adult with responsibilities. Wouldnt recommend this company
good,Must stay seated at desk if not at half hour lunch or 15 minute breaks.   Learned to use multiple systems and researching to assist customers. Management  has continued to receive bonuses while other employees have not received raises. This company has not offered raises for the last 6 years to the majority of the employees.  A lot of my co-workers are also looking other positions in similar type jobs.  The hardest part of the job is having to call a customer and let them know we are not able to assist with their needs due to the constraints of the terms and conditions of the various contracts.  I truly enjoy interacting with our customers and the feel of my co-workers being a 2nd family.
good,Trying to convince people to buy things to earn a commission was not for me. I felt like I was hassling people instead of letting them decide for them self. The customers often got annoyed.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job: My boss was great"
good,The hardest part of the job was black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers. Sometimes they just need someone to listen.
good,"Typical day, coming in getting told what to do when you already know. Sales goal to high to achieve on a slow day and attachments and protection agreements were held against you when you told customers about it already. Overall job quality is horrible have to do multiple jobs and no extra pay for it."
good,Sears is not very good at working around all work or school schedules. A gentleman I worked with requested only 20 hours a week and the managers agreed yet consistently scheduled him closer to 30. This lead to him quitting.  The managers are really hit and miss. Promotions rarely happen and seem to go more to the suck ups than those who deserve them. Sears isn't the worst place I've worked but it's far from the best
good,"Sears is good as a last resort. Sales commission job so the pay fluctuates. The atmosphere is really laid back. However, you're not only selling, you're trouble shooting for customers. This can take away from making any sales for that day."
good,At sears I did learn a skillI I learned how to service and repair washers and dryers.Good customer relations was a must. Having to deal with all types of customers. Making sure the job was completed to their satisfaction.
good,"Stock items, Push carts. Learned how to manage a staff on a shift .  this  job was newly built and definitely helped me adapt to new scenes quickly as well. Good opportunity"
good,I like being an Inventory Analyst at Sears because I feel like I am making decisions each day that impact sales to our members.  I enjoy taking apart the puzzle and figuring out what stores should be allocated product.
good,"Is a 100 year company with some changes coming and new stages to achieve, needs a new hiring process and some new managing materials"
good,"It was a seasonal sales job. Very basic."
good,No room for advancement but good starting job for someone looking to break into the workforce. Students looking to make some extra money will do well here.
good,"When I first started working for Sears after my first year of college it was an amazing company with a lot of programs and benefits for employees, regular raises based off performance and room to grow with their own training programs."
good,Management too sneaky and clique oriented.  Don't do scheduling right when asked...ASKED your availability.  Departments are unorganized signs paperwork missing. Employees are absolutely fun to work with very helpful with one another.  There is no more focus on the customer/member only what you can get from them. Too much focus on what other companies are doing and employee opinions don't matter when we are the constant in customer servive. Many complaints from members about sears new policies and involvement in their personal information needed for employee metric numbers to up
good,Maintained security in the store and managed the hardware division. I enjoyed being able to speak with many new people each day.
good,"A typical day at Sears requires me to keep the departments in order while being detail oriented for the customers. Along with constant greeting of the members, I am required to assist them with anything they might need and meet the metrics that come along with helping the customer. This job has taught me how to handle customers that are unhappy in a timely manner. While the management was strict they did what they could to help when it was needed. Teamwork was very important so being able to rely on coworkers was number one."
good,"This job is very secure. It is a basic sales job. Frankly, the hours make this a difficult job to work. 2nd shift is nobody's favorite."
good,"A typical work day would consist of accepting returns on mercahdinse and or exchanging the items. "
good,"Aprendi que la  resposabilidad de manejo de diversos controles de de bienes de la empresa, es una responsabilida  muy grande, ya que aun que a veces existian, tanta presiones me di cuenta de que si pude superar tales presiones con un gran exito, mostrando me que el dominio que obtuve en el trabajo fue al mes de haber entrado obteniendo mi planta, y la relacion con el de mas personal me hizo saber que el atender a una persona es aprender tanto."
good,"too many changes happening at once, and its a good job for someone that is starting to work for the first time. Nothing to stick with long term."
good,"This was a fast-paced, multi-task environment with extensive customer sales interaction and technical service writing requirements."
good,"Managing the cash wrap areas and ensuring compliance is maintained by all staff. Scheduling coverage is a challenge as you are working with a lot of part-time employess, Customer satisfaction can be rewarding and difficult at the same time."
good,"I drive to customers home to diagnosis and review the problem with appliance. Repair if applicable, including sales of parts and protection agreements. Giving the customers a quality customer service experience each time is a priority. My co-workers are stand up guys and can always be counted on for help."
good,"Success rests with the ability to motivate people, hire employees that can adapt to constant change, and meet the changing needs of your customers."
good,Sears seems to hire and give anyone the opportunity to develop important job skills that will eventually help anyone with a career in his/ her future. Coworkers and managers are friendly and will help anyone out.
good,"Looking ways to advance technology in retail leads to a challenging environment with great opportunity.   Co-workers are great and supportive, management could provide better direction."
good,"Every day is a productive day. From doing signing, setting up a department with new merchandise, and helping customers. I get get along well with my co workers. Management how ever could be improved. There is a lack of communication from store manager to the other associates."
good,"A typical day at work would be doing the same thing everyday which was pack boxes of cloths all day. Keeping count and keeping track of what items you'r packing. Management is decent but always feel like our crew of workers is behind. Good co-workers good though, always fun to talk to and work with. The most difficult part of the job is just lifting boxes of apparel that were no less then 80 lbs."
good,"I managed the loss prevention office.  I was responsible for the security equipment, safety measures, and theft determent."
good,Co workers are great. Rules and directions change each quarter.  Jobs are created and then quickly deleted.  Pay is good.
good,"great employees but some of the managers were bad with communicating with employees."
good,"Availability to learn various roles, however advancement is limited to open availability.  Many co-workers become more like work family."
good,"Did many jobs there"
good,"Sears management is great and understanding however the requirements and what is expected to be complete in a shift does not align up with the pay. The inconsistent hours are a downfall too."
good,"I would have stayed at this job indefinitely if I were making the money the job was worth. Anyone working the docks at sears should be making no less than $10 p/hr, because they do the work of 4 people each."
good,"No help from the other shifts in shared duties and also the management was lack the skill to control the teams and organization. Some of the co-workers there are helpful and really good at what they do. I feel the worse part at this job is the trash no one there wants to do and we didn't have the extra bodies there to control it. Sometimes it would have to be just all dump and compacted, instead of separated properly."
good,"The goal of the day was to ""take care of the customer"".  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customer.  The hardest part of the job was walking on concrete for hours and breathing in dust for hours.  My co-workers were wonderful helpful people including management.  I learned all about major appliances."
good,"It was always busy and you were never bored. There were always things to do, from checking customers out to cleaning up the dressing rooms. I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Sears is pretty much a starting job, that's it.  Your only chance of a raise was with a promotion that only comes if someone above you quits or is fired, since they have a pay freeze."
good,This job was very flexible while I was in college. I worked in the shoe department and it was commissioned based. It would get really intense as the other workers would stumble over you for a sale.
good,"As would be expected with an entry level position in any company, this position did not pay very well.  The work was long and on your feet for hours at a time.  Management found horrible things to say about work performance even when the things they found were of no consequence.  Would not work at this company again, the ladder to climb for better pay and better treatment as a person would not be worth it."
good,"Management could be better, Lots of things are backwards and antiquated here"
good,"Very flexible work environment. A great place to start a career. No room for job growth, but a great company to get your feet wet."
good,I enjoy the work that I do for this company but I question quite a few of the decisions made by management. Most decisions are misguided attempts to keep and retain the current customer base. The ability to perform our work without having a manager over our shoulder is definitely one perk of being an appliance repair technician.
good,"I approve of Sears Holdings it is a good company to work for. The people who work there are nice, kind, and caring. The management is good as well"
good,"A day at work was good when it was busy and we made our day in sales. Learning that to please every body is impossible with so many different types of management and co-workers. Hardest part of the job was to keep my intrest and bad feeling in check. Keeping with the job was almost at the ends when hours and comission was cut."
good,"My experience was mixed  but mostly good. I started out as a part time associate and worked my way up to store manager. Most days were center around taking care of our members by provided the best customer service. I had an excellent work staff and we worked together to make our store profitable. "
good,Pretty much a call center Job decent pay and overtime management was ok till it came to there bosses being on them. it was a sales environment with a hourly wage.
good,Aside from very poor management the skydeck was a blast. Seeing all the happy faces was a joy not to mention having access to the 103rd floor observation deck. I still think of my time there fondly. Great place for high school kids to work.
good,Call Centre jobs of late are not very secure. This company appeared to be secure and a good company to work for as it was not a third party or outsource. They were understanding and family friendly. It's just unfortunate that we were unable to keep the employees on Canadian soil.
good,A typical day consist of clocking in and standing on the floor for long hours with only commission pay.  You pray for sales because four other salesmen are scheduled and over lap for hours on your shift.  You are also thrown under the bus about meeting ever changing metrics.
good,The talented people that work for Sears are what keeps people coming back. I was lucky to be a part of such a storied organization that gave me my start in retail and also encouraged me to move up through various positions of professional advancement. Challenging environment made every day new and exciting. Hardest part of the job was likely ensuring there was enough support to push through a project. Most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by some of the most talented people in the retail industry.
good,"I did not enjoy working here. Although management was very good to be, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at sears. "
good,"Typical day at work was slow during the weekdays, and extremely crowded on the weekends. Management doesn't hire enough cashiers to compensate for the amount of customers who come through making the lines really long which in turn makes customers angry and they take it out on the employees. Co-workers were very nice, made some life-long friends. There wasn't a hard part of the job, it's mediocre labor; however the experience with most customers was terrible (it was mostly because of the long lines). The most enjoyable part of the job was being in an enclosed space with other cashiers, being able to communicate with them alongside you, basically not feeling alone unlike other Sears stores who have checkouts set up similar to a grocery store."
good,Work was hard but satisfying. I learned a lot about how a store operates by working in the back. Management was okay but an associate is not a manager. Co-workers were fun hard working individuals. Hardest part of the job was having to unload really heavy trucks sometimes by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of finishing a project that will help out everyone.
good,"Work started at noon and ended at 8:00 PM.  Learned about scanning product into inventory and then at times placing it in the proper shelves.  "
good,"The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable, working with the public.  Working in a major store inside a busy mall you are faced with every personality type and have to know how to diplomatically handle them all.  I learned how to disarm many potentially hostile situations with a smile."
good,"Things for Sears have not been easy these last few years and the CEO is making decisions that are making things harder. Other than that, the hours were long but the people worked earnestly"
good,The management team at Sears never wanted to help their employees unless they could take the credit for it. The company itself is not bad besides doing very poor business. Location may attribute to that.
good,"Sears is in a precarious position right now and is continuing to down size. They pay their hourly associates minimum wages to pay salary manages significantly. All the hour and job cuts resulted in a lot of associates taking on many extra responsibilities and these did not include a raise. That said Sears has some of the best store level managers you will find, which does not hold true for upper management."
good,"A storied company with 20,000 loyal hard working, passionate employees who are in the midst of the hardest time in the company's history. Massive changes are needed to restore the country's faith in a loyal brand. Hoping they find the tipping point and lead with integrity vs hot-headed executive egos."
good,I learned to build great communication skills. I also learned how to talk a person into purchasing something that they initially had no intent to purchase.
good,"-view daily task/mostly count inventory and stock missing shoe sizes"
good,"Meeting New people helping them obtain the Kitchen or Bath of their dreams, getting to design New Kitchens & Baths, watching their faces light up when they saw my designs. Weekly sales meetings were helpful and motivational. Co-workers and office personnel absolutely fantastic. Management some times helpful, somewhat distant and unavailable. Limited in products & types of credit offered, high end bath & Kitchen 75% of leads could not afford or obtain credit. Training consisted only of programs on computer, most were just introductory to be followed by real hands on training which was mostly nonexistent, trainer was unavailable for weeks to be trained,(not trainers fault) had three half days of actual classes.  According to curriculum was to be 4-6 weeks,1/2 classroom 1/4 computer classes & 1/4 in home training by Experienced consultants,  Did go on appointments with experienced sales consultants which was  helpful in process. Large turn over, most people left after training because felt unprepared and not experienced enough to actually perform job. Managers changed quite often. Hardest part sometimes no days off ,on the road 12-14 hours a day, 1-3 hours of paperwork to do when reached home, and the outdated laptop consistently crashed and froze while on appointments or downloading important paperwork for projects. Company had a good benefit plan that was unable to use do to lack of free time.  Was a good learning experience. Installations were performed well and turn around time very good on projects."
good,"Typical day: review sales of previous day and week.  Review current sales plan.  Evaluate staff on performance per metric category, do observations and coaching based on metric performance coupled with behavior observations. Meet with store manager, overall store strategy, evaluate sales goal and any additional topics.  Discuss on going customer issues, and staffing needs/ issues."
good,It's an OK place to work. Always strive for better with education.
good,"Learned a lot about this company. Faced the hardest part of this job, that I'm able to manage and dealt with on my own. Enjoyed working with people who understands where you're coming from. Everyday is a new challenged for me. I never stop learning each day"
good,"Truck lines as well as DSD vendors, were unloaded daily, the merchandise processed and sent to the floor.  Seasonal merchandise required pre-planning of space allocation.  Dealing with vendors, sales reps, as well as customers was a daily part of the job.."
good,When I started working there it was a fun place to work but by the time I left I would not recommend it to people.  The pay is on the low end and the hours expected to work are now outrageous.  Don't expect a balance between work and your personal life.
good,"a typical day at work for me at sears is usually a pretty steady to fast paced work environment. We service cars from batteries to brakes and fluid exchanges, alignments and suspension part replacement and a multitude of other things. We have seasonal changes in our workload. The summers tend to be a lot busier than the winter months, when it's busy its non-stop, and when it's slow it's dead. I began working at Sears as a tech level 1. I advanced to a tech level 3 within a 3  year time frame. Throughout which I've learned a great deal. The team that i work with is a very colorful,supportive, fun, unique, and diverse bunch.My mentors were always knowledgeable and welcoming. We all are like a family and manage to keep each other going. Being around them on a daily basis is actually the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part of the job would probably be trying to keep things running the proper way without management. We have been working for the past few years with only having a manager for up to a few months at a time before they resigned."
good,"Worked to maintain acceptable quality level of products thru interaction between merchandising team and vendors.  Worked with factories/vendors to improve product quality and prevent defects.  Collected, tracked and reported quality metrics to upper management.  Successfully worked with all types of personalities and cultures to get acceptable results."
good,Work was slow and I took on other responsibilities to fill the time.  I learned that I needed to work somewhere that allowed me to make commission or move forward.  Management and co-workers were civil.  The hardest part was trying to make a living at commissioned sales.  The most enjoyable part  of this job was interacting with customers.
good,"enjoyed helping customers, every day was different"
good,"-You need to be extremely sales driven for this job. "
good,The job it self was great. There was so much of changes occurring to improve the company toward the end which became confusing and out of control. The company was losing control of what's important and how to improve their services.
good,"Face to face customer service. Was able to learn a lot about electronic specifications, active environment with very helpful co-workers"
good,Sears and Sears Automotive used to be a great place to work. With scheduled flexible to college students and and overall fun atmosphere. Why wouldn't it be a decent place to work at? Everyone who works for Sears knows that they aren't doing it to be rich. But the tradeoff of a fun work environment was worth it. Take away that environment and nobody wants to be there anymore. It's now become depressing and that shows in the associates work. It's just not what it used to be.
good,"I wouldn't say an auto center is the best of best places to work but its a sometimes fast pace working environment ...a typical day consist of fast paces and hard working being that its commission based pay which sometimes is not always great, my co-workers are the best, I always look forward to a great day when working in teams, cant really say there is a hard part to the job unless 30 min lunch breaks count but overall its an easy job when you know your work...the enjoying part of work comes after the rush when things slow down and break time roll around, don't look forward to it but it helps... Management is just what it sounds like.."
good,standing all day and dealing with both happy and arrogant customers. It really enhanced my ability to tolerate the good and bad side of different people. the job was all about experiencing problems and solving those issues in a different environment then i was use to. there was no favorite part of the job it was just a job. my co-workers were fun they made the job tolerable but management was the part of the workplace that made it difficult to come in each morning and actually feel comfortable. it was not an easy or enjoyable place to work but it was a job for the most part and it was time to go when the hours could no longer pay the bills.
good,"Customer service, pricing, stocking, planograms sets, signing, inventory, cleaning, general retail expectation depends on shift open/close/ mid."
good,"Being able to work in an team environment to excel in an wholesale atmosphere, guaranteed customer service satisfaction with dealings through phone inquiries and face to face relations. I have learned to problem solve and assist in training associates to company standards and establish relationship with patrons as well as upholding and maintaining to my job responsibilities.The hardest part of my job is not knowing what to expect daily, but the thrill of it all is excelling in projects and store operations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer support and establishing ongoing relationships."
good,"Most days are slow, and a few years ago sears stopped allowing us to do announcements to drum up sales. so you spend a lot of time staring into space. i learned a great deal about watches but largely on my own, there is no incentive to do so. my co-workers were probably the best part of it, if you work with anyone 90% of the time your alone. hardest part of the job, was angry customers although most of the time it wasn't anger towards us but sears."
good,"my time here has been pretty enjoyable for the most part. as far as onsite goes, the workers and managers are very friendly and helpful always doing what we can to help each other succeed."
good,"In a typical day at work, I replenish merchandise on the floor, assist customer when needed.  On a Sunday day, set signing.  I emphasized good customer service.  I had a good relationship with my supervisors and co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is to lift heavy items, and the most enjoyable part is to assembly some parts of a tractor, also to enjoy every morning meeting with all employees.."
good,I love the customer that shop with the company .not enough assocites to handle some of the busy times use to be a fun place to work
good,"I really enjoy the family work atmosphere at Sears . It is all about Teamwork & Customer Service and a Positive Boost to start your day.  Your day would start with the 15 minute morning meeting and try to tidy up your work area to get ready for your Customer's.  Your always learning professional customer service skills to help you effectively provide the customer with their needs at that time, whether it was a billing problem, activating new accounts, complaints or helping them find that perfect item;  All the management staff are there too help and support you either with extra training or just jumping in too handle a busy day. All your co-workers are just as quick too jump in and help with any questions you may have about a particular job or lend a helping hand if needed.  The hardest part of my job is making sure that all our customers are satisfied with their purchases. I try too make sure that they all have a smile and feel important while they are there and when they are ready to leave.  The Greatest part of my job is getting that special compliment from our customers on how satisfied they are with their shopping experience and friendly service. It's always a Good Feeling!!"
good,"My experience was bitter sweet. My work experience was sweet because of the people I worked with, we were a team. The manager I had was great, she was like a counselor because she knew how stressed, underpaid and overworked her employees were. My experience was bitter because I never received a raise for the two years I worked there. If you are looking to move up in the company your chances are slim."
good,Start Day Drive around to Scheduled Appointments try be Personable many different People daily All brands Dealings . Many Skills needed People & Product . I enjoy Driving have good skills since Drivers Ed Days Excellent Record . I Still enjoy my appliance repair profession just Too Difficult to keep Management satisfied on Performance on the Job Training yourself not enough Time Allowed !    I Do enjoy my Coworkers interacting with people daily !!
good,"Although I stayed in the Accounts Payable department, The company allowed the opportunity to learn and excel in various roles within but not subjective to specific departments. "
good,"I worked at sears while going to school. "
good,"We sold products to customers, and met all kinds of people. I learned how to become one of the best sales consultants there is. The best part of the job was making lifelong friends, and working on teams to satisfy customers needs."
good,"Sears has a great team of dedicated hard working merchants, it is a pleasure to work with them daily."
good,"They were very flexible with my school schedule and whenever I needed time off, but unless you can manage to get a management position you'll probably never make more than minimum wage."
good,"If you want to move up quickly this is the company to work for"
good,A very boring job with no change on day to day operations. No advancement.
good,A lot of refolding of clothes and continuously re-straightening shelves and re-organizing the sales floor. I learned to smile and assist customers and give advice on matching clothes and shopping for others. Management followed through every step of the way and when you had a question they always seemed to have an answer. Hardest part of the job was around Christmas with extreme coupon shoppers and long hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the joy on customers faces when they found what they were looking for and when they saved money.
good,"Sears unit 1465 was always busy with external apprehensions"
good,"Host"
good,I loved working at Sears Auto until one day I show up for work and after 12 years I was told well we are going to be closing this store in 2 months and we don't know if we can offer you another job somewhere else.  This was only a month after upper management assured me that our store was not closing.  The upper management really needs to get things figured out in order to save sears as a company.
good,They could not work with my schedule and pay was to little compared to drive time and responsibility.
good,"I enjoyed my store. My bosses were always helpful. However, the corporate structure made it very hard to ever visit with my bosses to discuss the store and growth for the store."
good,"In order to efficiently complete day-to-day tasks at this business, multi-tasking is a high priority. Customers needs come first, store operations come second."
good,Install and repair field AC units. Repair refrigerators in shop. Excellent supervisors friendly co-workers. Hardest part was learning to service all Sears products. Successfully making quality repairs with precise accuracy.
good,"Various opportunities to work on HVAC equipment, refrigerators, ice makers, trash compactors, lawn mowers, microwaves, stoves, washing machines & dryers."
good,Enjoyed being able to help customers by signing up for a rewards membership and helping them learn about all the different ways they could save money on their purchases.
good,"Depending on the day you can either be super busy or super slow. MCA (Merchandise and Customer Assist) have many duties, but it also depends on how much training you have under your belt while working there. "
good,It was a challenging at times but I also met some really nice customers.
good,"Was told that I would receive 20 hours a week of work but discovered once in the position, I would only receive 5 hours of work each week."
good,Can be a fun career because of all the different customers. The managers expect salespeople to handle any problems. Its a lot of hard work cleaning and setting up the floor models.
good,Each day at Sears brings a new challenge. Patience is the key with working in a large corporation. I enjoy working with my fellow co-workers and solving customer issues. The hardest part is being unable to solve a customer's problem because of corporate rules and regulations. The best part is finding a way to solve a problem that appeared to be unsolvable.
good,"too focused on pushing customers, management not very organized."
good,very busy place you deal with all kinds of different things on daily basis.
good,"If it was a truck day I would helped unload the truck. After the truck was done I would start to process the boxes for the various departments in the store. The boxes that I processed were for the apparel departments of men's, women's, junior's, kid's and land's end. I also processed the boxes for home fashions department."
good,My temp job was a simple one So i didn't really have any complaints.
good,They expect you to do 3 things at once and have no understanding of time need to do any. The management was always in disarray.
good,"I would come in at whatever time I was scheduled for that day and check what register I was going to be stationed at. A regular day consisted of checking out customers, assisting them with whatever needs and concerns they had in the store, and keeping the store in a clean state."
good,"While working Merchandise pick up i would retrieve large objects from stock room or expensive items and bring them to the costumer and sometimes load their vehicle. "
good,"The most difficult part of this job was the management. Turnover for managers here is incredible, and HR was removed. So if there are any kinds of conflicts, you have to wait a month to talk to the district manager."
good,I totally enjoyed working in the merchandising aspect of things.  I like the idea of doing something different everyday but still giving perfect customer service at the same time. This is the reason I went into management in the merchanding area.  I enjoyed working with my co workers as a team and communicating about any changes or work  that wasn't finished off at end of day.( Although I myself would normally stay extra hours to finish up a job unfinished.) I  learned something new everyday in the merchandising field or in retail in general.  I like meeting new people and facing new challenges
good,"A day consisted of monitoring CCTV surveillance cameras checking the store for shoplifters. While surveying the store, an inspection was completed daily for safety features of the store. My coworkers and I would cooperate together to apprehend any individuals that shoplift from the store. Management would supervise and make sure that this task was done correctly."
good,It was a great learning experience. Opportunity could have been endless. They worked with me anytime I needed assistance.
good,"Never board always work to be done. Co-workers were friends."
good,Sears was a good place to gain the experience of the the call center field.
good,"Work gets stressful at times, good people to work with. Very demanding in terms of meeting sales target."
good,"A typical day at this location was busy and full of demands."
good,"Great company if you know upper management.  Company has very high expectations for performance but are not very giving to employees. Schedules, days off, work metrics tardies, absent days, vacation are not accepted at all. Its difficult to get time off for dr. Appts without being written up."
good,learned to communicate with all kind of people and their culture.
good,"This was a minimum wage retail job, enough said!"
good,It is a company that has a lot demands for employees but that is typical of anywhere. They are very relaxed and understand when something is not done.
good,"They make you sale. They use and abuse you tell they can no more."
good,great place to work and fun people.  my only complaint is low hours for employees
good,Working here is a challenging and rewarding experience.  I have enjoyed the people and my managers who have helped me succeed in my role.
good,"A typical day was employees trying to beat one another in sales because the job was commission based, I learned that people will be dishonest just to make a sale, the management was sub-par they didn't help resolve any of the dishonesty issues among co workers the hardest part of the job was working outside the most enjoyable part was assisting customers with their needs."
good,"Sears was not a fun place to work at. Upon being hired, I needed to lay off 32 individuals. Not fun. That was not the end though...in all, as most now know, Sears Home Services is closing it's doors. Sad as there are ALOT of great individuals working here and the powers that be...do NOT listen to the staff. C'est La Vie."
good,Ma journée de travail débute soit à 6heures ou 7 heures du matin bien souvent c'est moi qui ouvre la porte du magasin car j'ai la clé et le code du système d'alarme je suis toujours de bonne humeur car j'aime ce que je fais. Il y a un très bel esprit d'équipe avec mes collègues.
good,"I am a merchandiser for Sears. I love what I do but the management could be better. The pay is terrible and your chances at advancement are not very good. They say that they promote from within but so far they have hired an ASM, Dept Lead, and Store Manager all from the outside in the time I've worked here (which has been over a year). They are cliquey and choose favorites. They don't care about how hard you work or how good at your job you are unless your one of there chosen few. Over all it's what can expect from a retail department store."
good,"Go into work, check reports, worked on usual day to day duties, assisted customers and fellow associates."
good,"A typical day at Sears consists of attempting to push Credit Cards, a Rewards Program, Online Ordering, Protection Agreements, and Promotions on customers in an effort to meet a strict nationwide quota enforced by very unfriendly upper management with no exceptions. The daily workload and expectations for a single employee can often feel like too much, especially at an entry level, minimum wage part time job. However, I did learn some valuable salesperson skills as well as social skills beneficial in that field of work. Management was out of whack, however. Upper management was filled with soulless individuals without enough modern salesfloor experience to really understand what they were pushing on us. Store management was *okay*. The particular location I worked at, however, has multiple bodies in management that did little more than walk around the store, sometimes offering cashier assistance at a busy register. There were also several competent managers, however. The co-workers at that particular location, at least, were, for the most part, fantastic and friendly, although none of them were really too fond of Sears, it's beliefs, or it's management. That would have to be the reason that so many customers were also getting annoyed with Sears; they push too many small things on customers all the while being a totally unrelatable  corporate entity. The hardest part of the job would be simultaneously not getting my head chewed off by customers or management, while trying to appease both sides. This was a constant hassle. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the"
good,"Sears Holdings was a very good induction into professional management. In my experience, if you worked hard and had solid communications skills you were upwardly mobile."
good,"Sears need to grow and learn from its competitor.  It was a great job out of college to further develop my leadership skills. The 20% goal increase every year for sales is attainable.  The hardest part of the job was just multitasking the numerous task, procedure, operation, employees, customer, coaching, etc... It's never ending.  Other then that, I enjoy the team their at Westminster and the customers. "
good,"I liked SHC, but they are a dying company and are always looking to cut hours for anyone who is not a salaried manager.  I worked in LP, hold a bachelors degree, and was educating my manager on certain things, which shouldn't happen.  I feel they did not value what I did for them, and they have a lot of work to do to get their company straight again, their priorities and business decisions are not the best."
good,"I do not dwell on a typical day far as a work day. I look at every day as a productive day."
good,"I enjoyed the work very much and I was always busy doing something so my day always went by pretty quickly, that's always a plus. One thing I will say is, When you go in looking for advancement, they told me I would work up very quickly, I was there for a year and never heard a thing from corporate about moving up, although the Store Manager told me constantly that I was close to advancement, just so he could keep me there.. maybe? But I moved on and advanced elsewhere much more quickly."
good,Assisted customers in selection of tires. Gave customers estimates for repair on their vehicles.
good,"•a typical day at work: Fast Pace"
good,"Nice community of people working together. Typical day of work is 8 to 9 hours, mostly manual labor. Management training is very on point. Diverse arrangement of people that work for sears."
good,Friendly store associates and always something to do. The lack of advancement and downsizing is the biggest fall back for the company.
good,Best for people in college who want to make extra money. You may find yourself working a 10- 12 hr shift.
good,"customer service by taking merchandis to the customer vehicle, checking customer orders and layaways, straighting the stockroom and organizing receiving merchandise in that come  by ups fedex etc customer returns  building pallets of merchandise that was to be shipped out. co workers were easy to get along with most of the  time got along with others"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears mostly, I liked the customers and the learning experience. I was hired for Seasonal Help, was told if they like you they will keep you. Basically everyday I worked I was harped about how many credit applications I had got that day. I finally got tired of hearing about it and told my cashier manager just that. Well I said, ""frankly I am really tired of hearing about it, I am a good cashier, do I come to work on time everyday, do I work extra shifts and stay over, am I a pleasant person to be around"", she answered to it all saying you are great! And I said, ""well I think it is really sad that my performance is being based on credit apps"". I was offered a position to stay if I said I would do whatever possible to get more credit apps. I said I would try harder, but there are certain people I don't bother asking, like the already angry customer, teenagers, people that are unwell and the elderly that appear to need to rest cause they are so tired. They said I was discriminating. There was also 3 days I was in Kids department by myself with a line the whole day, every time I paged for help, no one came. I said I am not asking customers that are waiting 30 minutes in line and tell me so when they finally make it to the register because they are so angry. I was told it only takes a couple minutes to do a credit app and I said that is a total lie. I waited in line 10 minutes one day with one customer in front of me that was applying for credit. I said to the customer that has already waited in line 30 minutes that 10 minutes or 2 minutes to do a credit app"
good,They always need someone but the management is downright horrible. I was in management for awhile and left because they backstabbed me. I worked there for 3 years and always had a stable source of income but the lack of ethics in the company became to much for me to handle. There were no raises given to anyone in my store for over 5 years.
good,Dept manager was great to work with and coworkers were good people. Job sucks for someone with a college degree and I hated the short 30 minute lunch break. The position requires a lot for low pay. Loved employee discounts. Would probably work there again part time if the chance  came
good,"A typical day at Sears would be standing at the register all day. I learned how to sell and persuade people to buy things, and sign up for their credit cards. The Management here was not bad. They always made sure that we got breaks on time and were comfortable. I did not make too many friends here because they were all in competition to sell the most credit cards. The hardest part was that I was bored most of the time. The most enjoyable part was the experience I gained."
good,I need to change my career from 40 years of retail.  It is time for a change. I am currently enrolled in the Fundraising management graduate certificate program at the UW.
good,"My typical day was servicing customers with credit card payment, purchases and returns. Assisting customers with applications as they apply for credit cards. What I loved about the Job was that I was in only one department."
good,"A good place to work and build customer service and salesperson skills if on commission and in the right department at the right time. Clear compensation for effectively promoting certain benefits such as Credit. Management view all customers as a number and employees are frequently asked to basically trick customers into signing up for things that cannot be reversed quickly."
good,"I would open up the parts department and immediately check the Service Technicians schedules and make sure they were up to date.  I would schedule appoints for the technicians to come out to customers houses for repairs, and also ordering any parts the technicians might need for that job.  I scheduled myself and about 5 other employees to cover the parts/service department.  I would assist in ordering parts daily for our stock and take inventory.  The hardest part of the job was that most of the customers were very upset when they would call because one of their appliances had broke down and they want it fixed as soon as possible, and sometimes they would take out their anger on me.  But I most enjoyed when a really tough job was able to get taken care of and the customer ended up very happy."
good,"""The job is not difficult at all. I basically put up signs multiple times a week and reorganize shelves and appliances."" Couldn't say it any better. Nothing really learned.  Management was horrible. Co-workers varied greatly. N/A for last two points."
good,"typicaly, wait on customers with different needs, learned about paint prep, mixing & application, most management pre ordained from HQ, good co-workers, hardest thing was satisfy the customer also the most enjoyable when sucessful"
good,"My day would be full of different experiences and ways to learn to improve my selling technics but interacting with my management. The hardest part of my day was when we didn t have the product for a customer, But it was always a good feeling when you matched up the customer with the right product for their needed."
good,Working at Sears was not at all what I expected. The only reason I stayed so long is because I was in a desperate need of a job.
good,"back to back calls mostly dissatisfied customers"
good,"I,possible expectations long hours, low pay, unreasonable patrons"
good,"I already posted a review.  for some reason it didn't go through the first time. Its ok place to work though. Just that the paychecks at the end of the week, don't add up enough to the amount of hours you put in for the week"
good,worked as a cashier and moved up to all other departments. its retail so you have to have patience
good,I only worked there for a holiday but at the time they were really good to me.
good,A typical day with sears is non stop phones ringing and everyone is looking to call out a technician or there technician was late or never showed up. With those calls comes a lot of frustration and confusion.  There was lots of escalated calls which not all the time would a manager take of the call as we suppose to. So on average I was calming people and taking care of the situation all on the same call. Thanks to the co-works I worked with they took all that pressure and stress right away. I could always turn to my fellow team mates. The hardest part of job was escalated calls because its hard making the person who feels the company not doing anything to help them that you are trying to help them. The easiest part about the job has to be just setting up for a technician to come out there and inspect and fix their appliance or tool they had bought through sears or one of the manufacture.
good,"Open store or close store.  Have plan of action for days work.  Meet with associates and give out instructions for the day.  Invest time departments, truck unload process.  Read email and take care of financial area as needed.  Possibly interview new candidates.  Take care of customers.  Be a presence throughout the store and make sure everything runs smoothly.  Assist and help where needed.  Close store if closing manager."
good,its a good job but it doesn't get that much business but its a great job to have.
good,"learned alot about how service calls took place,selling warranties and services customers in need"
good,Sears is a great place to gain sales experience. Schedules are not very flexible.
good,"A good day at work involves great teamwork from my from employer's, and i take in consideration that i want to always deliver a WOW experience to my co-workers, and employer's. Management is good, only to divide who's working hard, and who isn't. I manage to take in the desirable information to get the job done  and more. I consider my co-workers to be nice, and friendly, and the most hardest part of my job is the heavy load i take on everyday. I am good at what i do, and i can elevate to a more presentable role to induce the WOW experience. The most enjoyable part about my job is that i make sure all my customer is happy, and they leaving with a smile on their face, and chance that i may see them again soon."
good,delivering parts to customers and techs learned trade of reoairing household appliances easy people to work with
good,I enjoy working with people and meeting their needs and expectation. I also enjoy tremendously the merchandising aspect of job. But the lack of mentor and career advancement make it feel like dead end job.
good,This company is not very well ran or managed with a very high attrition.
good,It was a little disorganized. I did learn how to use multi phone line calls. Most of my co-workers were helpful and fun. The hardest part of the job was having to take care of the upset customer that waited all day for their technician to show and didn't. The most enjoyable part was helping the customer and satisfying their needs.
good,"•une journée de travail typique"
good,"Seasonal, part time employee with very little benefits"
good,"i am blessed to have a jo0b w sears, I have had a job in retail w sears for  9 years."
good,you have to step on some toes just to get ahead but overall it's a great place to work
good,"Each day that I go into Sears Outlet my responsibilities are for me to great customers and answer any questions that they might have about product that we carry in the store. Sell products to customers along with setting up delivery for the customer if they are needing it delivered to their home. Cancellations or returns of products that are not up to customers standards. Closing, banking/nightly deposits are part of my nightly responsibilities, along with making sure the to store is clean. I have learned from this company that money is more important than customer service. I like working with a good portion of my fellow co-workers. There is really only one co-work that I don't really like to work with and that is the General Manager. I feel like he doesn't know what he is doing in that position. The hardest part of my job is the only person running the store at night when there is no one else there to help with 30 different customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility that I get with this position."
good,helping customers of varied backgrounds make a purchase while working with informed co-workers.
good,A fast paced environment knowing that my co workers always had my back. Helping each other was very important. Also make the job enjoyable.
good,"Work is very easy, just having to deal with people you work with including managers isn't very good."
good,The job payed enough for the time. I had a store manager for a total of about half the time I was employed with SEAR'S which made things stressful for my higher ups. Which on sum occasions it effected us in an anti-productive way. Over all I's say working at SEAR'S wasn't completely awful but I am in no hurry to re-apply.
good,"A typical day can be tiring and the managers dont make it easy for you. I learned better people skills, how to work a register, and stock. Management can be nice but they can also not be very caring or helpful. The co-workers are great and they make working a lot easier. The hardest part of the job is gett people to sign up for a sears credit card which is hard because of their high interest rate. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers and when a department does good we sometimes get lunch for free."
good,it was my pleasure working for sears but working on commission got a little stressful.
good,"An ok job for  part time hours.Not as organized,as they should be."
good,"Commission Sales Major Appliances				   	                 	  "
good,The company is grasping for everything it can and is super intense on all metrics while customer after care is lacking.
good,"Sears is a great place to start out and gain experiences. If your looking for great pay than this is not the avenue to take. Sears can do a much better job of recognizing their employees, building a better relationship with its partners...their assets which are some dedicated employees"
good,Very great place to work however i would like to advance and obtain additional skills.
good,"I understand the demands of retail BUT... MCAs (specifically) work harder than any other employees at SEARS and still make minimum wage. MCAs are expected to: cashier, assist customers on the sales floor, stock the sales floor, clean the fitting rooms and cashier station, AND stay late just about EVERY night even on Saturdays when we're expected to stay to 11pm anyway (closing). MCAs who close CAN NOT leave until all departments are clean, including the areas other people are responsible for. You will definitely get at least 30 hours/wk because they ""don't have enough MCAs""; which means they will work you like a slave because they're short staffed. Job advancement is only available for someone who sucks up to the managers. I worked hard and did my job well but was prevented from advancement because ""they didn't have anyone else."" Meanwhile the people promoted to leads and managers were generally the slowest and laziest employees. Co-workers are usually very helpful. Some great people work there unfortunately they are greatly taken for granted."
good,The work there was grueling. Being in a hot trailer for hours trying to unload it. People there also love to start drama with other employees. 
good,"A typical day at Sears consists of the following;"
good,"Sears doesn't take good care of its employees. Since we work on commission , people can get very aggressive. I like customer service, help customers w/ translations, and providing the right product to their needs. I like to get to know people and feel like I can make a difference. I also believe that time work is helpful if everybody can feel the rules are the same for everyone. It makes it stronger and much more productive."
good,"I do enjoy talking to customers about televisions and the technologies associated with them.  I also get to learn about all the latest technologies as well."
good,"what you're expected of is not explained in the interview process. Every associate, especially the cashiers, are expected to maintain an unrealistic goal in signing people up for credit. Honestly, the amount of work that you have to do, and the stress you are constantly under is not worth the pay. "
good,I got this job with the intention of it being a transitional job; just a job that would last until I found another job. But I ended up working there for over a year. It was nice in my department but other departments were not so great. Some departments such as appliances tended to be very cut-throat because of the commission based nature of the job many associates would take other associates customers or even sales. Like I said it was a decent job although it did have its flaws.
good,I had a blast at Sears because I controlled my paycheck. Had an opportunity to work with a fantastic manager that taught me a lot about sales. The only drawback is you have to be present to sell sell sell....
good,"working for sears was a fun job, i got to sell the things i love and met alot of interesting people. but the lack of good management led to us never having anything in stock which led to low sales and pay"
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is workin with my co-workers. A typical day at work is meeting a certain goal & accomplishing it. I learned how to work at a steady pace with other people that works either slower or faster than me. Their is nothing hrd about this job to me.
good,The base pay is horrible and the way they make there commission percentages are unbelievable 
good,I sold mattresses and vacuums. I worked on commission. It was an easy job. I didn't like when other employees would take the ring up a sell you made with their employee number and management would not do anything about it.
good,The company values their employees & the management find a way to make the work days bearable.
good,"This is a retailer, that has been a around a long time, out lasting, Simpsons, Eaton's and now Zellers. As a commission only sales rep.' they do not offer a lot of benefits or opportunities, unlike what I was pitched on, during the interview. They are more of a sign that retail is near the end of it's rope, and there are massive consolidations coming. I knew the pay was not going to great, but I was disappointed by the lack of opportunity to move in the company."
good,sears is a place for a kid in school. Not really a full time job for someone. The asm and store manager is a joke. the store does not work as a team and the bigger people do not care about the ones below them. your just there to do there work and to make sure they look good for people above them. 
good,"A typical day at Sears was rather slow and laid back.  The thing I liked most about this job was the interaction with the customers and coworkers.  The management team was excellent in the fact that they were always available when needed and was always willing to help.  In the short time that I worked for this company the employees that I worked with were very friendly and courteous.  They generally liked the working environment and were easy to get along with.  The hardest part of this job was the constant inactivity during the down periods.  Having come from a fast food environment that was constantly active and with being in charge most of the time, it was hard to stand still for most of the day."
good,"The typical work day are periods of busy work, Management is very understanding at times, co-workers are all warm and welcoming, the hardest part of the job is during system outages. This would be a great start out position for a HS student for summer or stay at home moms who needs to supplement income. "
good,"This job requires a lot of work and multitasking for the pay rate. You don't get a lot of recognition for the work done. You are expected to give up social parts of life including holidays, birthdays and events to work there. Co-workers can be snide and like to start drama."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of balancing the registers and finishing transactions. When time permitted, cashiers would help stock merchandise. Department managers were friendly and helpful. Store management and assistant management were very demanding. Company places a large emphasis on accumulating credit card applications and rewards program enrollments. Employees that have been there a very long time are being forced into lower positions or having their hours cuts back. They are often replaced by less experienced people that are not looking for serious work."
good,the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. they say they will work with your outside schedule and they don't. the head store manager is nice.
good,"Advising, assiting customers in the type of equipment that would best suit thier needs for lawn care. I learned how to sell accesories with every purchase. In retail managers transfer almost annually, but overall I had a very good relationshio with the person who held that position. Although, it was commission based my co-workers and I never took credit for someone else's sale whether you were present at work or that would be your off day. Tremendous amount of walking, and sometimes there was physical activity (i.e.) stocking. Enjoyed interacting with so many different people. Also, there were montlhy competitions that I remained on top for the lasst 16 consecutive months."
good,"I assisted my immediate supervisor in leading our team to success by coaching for improved work performance, providing motivation and support, and leading by example."
good,Was I nice place to work. Hours were not the best. Started late and had to close at the end of day.
good,the company is always willing to send you to training to further advance your career. I have learned a lot from this company good and bad. the hardest part of the job is the same thing everyday. the job is very monotonous but if you like walking into work everyday and knowing what your going to be doing all day then this is the job for you. the best part of the job is the coworkers and getting to know the customers. knowing that your helping the customers take care of their investment is the most rewarding.
good,I enjoyed being a part of the Sears corporation but at the time I worked there the pay was low and the room for advancement was little to none. The store manager was more than disliked by all the employees and most of the customers as well. I enjoyed the department I worked for and the work was okay. I just wanted more from my job and required more compensation for the lifestyle that I live.
good,"Although the work is good, the hours and long days are overbearing. SHC in the Yuma/El Centro area is not concerned that it's employees are being overworked (ie 50+ hours every week, 10+ hour days, mandatory 6th days 2x/month) The employee is not important, just the bottom dollar"
good,The customers would often bring small children around their nap time or feeding time-this makes for cranky customers which makes for not-so-nice pictures.
good,I began working with Sears part time. There is only room for advancement when another associate retires in the department I work in.
good,Liked working with my coworkers but hated that I never recieved a raise except when minimum wage went up.
good,"Loss Prevention consists of following the 5 plays; shortage control, external theft, internal theft, safety, and people. Everything we do is a means to an end. Your shrink result ultimately judges how you performed over the fiscal year. I enjoy going to work everyday. Although the money is not the best, I try to make a difference each and every day I work. I understand that there are things you can control and other things you can influence. The store must understand what loss prevention does and how to help the programs and how they can affect the store."
good,"At Sears I loved my customers and my job, however there is more to a career than that. I did not approve of many of the actions and decisions made by some managers and human resources. There is definitely some favoritism played within Sears and alot of singleing out employees. Also, the overall views and goals of the company as a whole is no longer directed to customer service. The goals that are pushed upon the associates are directing them away from making customers happy. Much work is needed to make it a better overall company."
good,This storied retailer is suffering from a serious culture disconnect: the highest levels of management are disengaged and completely insulated from the repercussions of their decisions. Corporate headquarters personnel enjoy a corporate lifestyle to which hourly associates have little or no access.
good,"Had to talk myself nto going to work everyday, its shut down now. Wasnt the nicest management ive worked for"
good,"My experience working for Sears was not as I expected. A company with a good history and a decent reputation should have professional individuals making up their management team. But I found this to be far from the case at the location for which I worked. The entry level employees were typically more professional than the salaried employees. It certainly did not help that there were added pressures to sell products and services to customers who were far from interested. I learned a great deal about sales transactions and customer service, but I also learned what not to do if I ever become a manager of a retail store, or anywhere for that matter."
good,"As long as I have worked with this company, My BIGGEST gripe has always been with the way they treat their associates. Management in these stores are just sometimes downright disrespectful. Applicants please go in expecting this."
good,"At first working for Sears was exciting, looking forward to some advancement and a great work environment."
good,The company was very unorganized and the pay was horrible. The good thing about the company was the flexible work schedules. I am a college student with children so I require a flexible work schedule.
good,"Great customer relations, strong emphasis on task activities"
good,"This job demanded a lot of my time, which, in most cases, I did not mind. I love interacting with all of the customers and co-workers. I loved the challenges of overcoming and resolving customer complaints and issues as well as giving great customer service."
good,"A typical day at work was very laid back. What I learned working here was the value of customer service and how a simple smile could make someone's day. Management rarely came from the back office, it was mostly the customers and associates. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that we didn't have a product and the most enjoyable part of the job was being involved with the customers."
good,A typical work day would consist of the receiving crew unloading the stock trucks and putting away the merchandise.
good,It started well but then hours were cut and insurance price went up as well
good,I really wasn't there long enough to get in the grove of how things work up there because I got layed off due to not enough business at the time I was hired.
good,"Worked at the Sears Grand in Lenexa, KS. Overall the experience wasn't great and wasn't awful. For every bad manager there was another good one who made your job bearable to show up for as just the typical hourly worker. Never been a fan of retail jobs."
good,"My typical day consisted of me first thing I would do was to do the go backs, clean dressing rooms. Hang and re-stock merchandise. Straighten out sales floor. Greet Customers and assist them with their questions."
good,"I spend most of my time filling prescription orders via computer input, and safety review of medications used in combination with other medications and patients current disease state(s)."
good,"The staff were friendly towards customers, but rather cut-throat towards each other, especially in the areas that worked on commission. Not much of a team environment. Management was decent at times, but other times seemed to threaten our jobs if we, for example, weren't smiling enough. The most enjoyable part of the job overall was being able to help customers find what they needed at an affordable price."
good,"My first job, was what i expected being the new and one of the youngest working at the store. They took me ans made apart of everyday operations and multiple departments in the store."
good,Load my truck up at 5AM and start the delieveries until I was finished.
good,i learned a lot about on costumer service. working with people in the industry was easy at sears. my management team was very helpful.
good,"I did everything there was to do,"
good,"Large appliance and whole kitchen,and installation sales"
good,"• Responsible for detecting, reporting, and resolving all issues related to Loss Prevention and Inventory/Shortage."
good,Ring up customers. You have some good and bad managers. Co-workers are friendly. HArdest part of thr job is corporated expectations. Helping the customers find what they are looking for.
good,the co-workers are the best. The most enjoyable part of this job are my co-workers.
good,"A typical day at Sears Hometown Store, starting the day at 8:30 a.m, get my load sheets ready for all my deliveries.Then i would proceed to call my customers an give them a estamaited time for my arival for their installation of new home appliance. My Store Manager was on of my favorite Store Managers that i have ever had through out my working career, he was always making sure that i was happy with what i was doing for that day an he would always take my input into concideration weather it was good or bad overall he was very involled in his employees.The employees that i had to work with were all very nice never a dull moment.The hardest part of my job at Sears was the long distance of driving each day dealing with traffic on freeways an in town streets. Overall working at Sears HomeTown Store was very intresting, walking into a line of work that i have never done befor an having to learn how to install home appliances an their sytem, it was hard at first but i was very deticated to learning everything that i was able to while i was there."
good,"I stayed busy @ work & enjoyed my coworkers. We all worked hard. I divided & distributed mail, counted money, made deposits, paid invoices, contacted IT when necessary, set up new computer programs & helped train employees, shut down computers & keyed payroll once a week. I loved this job & its diversity. The company made some bad business decisions over the years, which has resulted in their closing many of their locations. This is very unfortunate. The last six weeks @ our location, our HR quit & I had to take over those duties as well."
good,"My typical day at work was clocking in and going straight to work on what was assigned to me for that day,printing out sales tickets and placing them in their correct spots all the way to putting up signs. Replacing old Merchandise and setting up displays. Always Busy busy busy. Just the way I liked it. I learned how to manage my time on task that were given just to make sure everything was completed before the end of my shift. Management was alright,slightly professional but not all the way. My Co-workers were friendly at times but I always continued on my work. The hardest part of my job was coming in early and the doors would be locked and it was located in a bad area,and I was taking Public Transportation, so id have to stand outside for a hour or hour and a half by myself in a vacant lot. The most enjoyable part of my job was the Customers they kept me coming back to work and they always kept a smile on my face because they knew I was more than happy to help and assist them the best way that I could."
good,"Work at sears is a constant hassle, the value of the company is based only on making money with no regard to customers. They threaten associates with termination if they do not sell enough ""add ons"" such as credit enrollment, extended purchase plan, in house warranties. Which changes the demeanor of the associates and they become pushy sales associates which in turn brings back bad reviews."
good,The people who I worked with were nice.If I needed help someone was there to help.
good,"I start my day by running queries to check incoming merchandise then I proceed to the dock area where the merchandise is received to get all of the dimensions so that when it is shipped from our warehouse the items are put into the proper boxes for our customers. I've learned how to generate the tickets in which the customers have made on-line purchases for as well as to print those tickets for other employees to get said merchandise and many other computer applications. On top of that I've been trained to operate certain machinery within the warehouse. What I love most about my job is that in my department, QA, we control the flow of information for all the other departments. I have a lot of responsibilities in which I love & handle responsibly. The hardest part is 4th qtr or Christmas season. There are a lot of long days and business is very fast but it's also rewarding personally as well as professionally because we're servicing our customers and the more efficient we are it's better for our profit sharing."
good,"It was a retail job in shoes. I enjoyed working with shoes and the people that came into the store. I kept my area clean and picked up. I opened and closed the store, counted registers, stocked inventory, cleaned the stock room replenished the shoes when inventory came in."
good,I worked 16 hours a week. It was hard to get information on any new procedures and sometimes did not have back up help.
good,"It provide you opportunity to further your education, but there is no opportunity to move up."
good,"I learned alot in Sears as a repair tech due to the fact that you are repairing everyday your repair skills accel/ time management is a big factor and you deal with a hectic route. I liked working on different models of appliances. management was ok if they were a previous tech.Wish they had better organizatiion within the company and the culture needs to be more caring to the employees.Retirement was taken away,benefits were diminished"
good,I worked in the footwear department as a Footwear Associate.
good,While the customers were great to work with some of the staff were not to friendly. They didn't seem to enjoy their job very much.
good,"Didnt like working at Sears very much,the management was not very good,and the store I worked at was not in very good shape."
good,Was able to set about 3 appointments a day. Great incentives ands spiffs. Although it was not a very good work environment
good,A typical day at work is very busy always new projects to take on. I learned the it is best to continue to learn new abilities to move up to better positions. I have also learned how to be a team player and continue learning. The hardest part of my job is seeing how much money is being paid out for claims. the most enjoyable part of my job is having the flexibility of my work schedule.
good,"On a typical work day I would have to show excellent customer service. What I learned at this job was how to run a cash register, and work with the general public. My management was great, but they stayed on us. My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of my job was it was seasonal job and it was rush, rush, rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was, a new learning experience."
good,Hard And Vigorous Team Work Yet The coworkers cligament the work day seem less stressful. The management lacks professionalism and ethics in most cases.
good,"Interesting job, fun people to work with,I worked in the auto department and we all worked together as a team. Customers had different problems with their vehicles, resulting in a great variety of work performed.Managers were fair and helpfull."
good,"Ok pay, no benefits, you see alot of employees come and go, overall a fair job."
good,"A typical day for me was mostly in the camera room. I photographed a variety of people. Before this job, I had no photography experience. I was able to learn alot here. I photographed a variety of people, from newborns to toddlers, to teens, to adults. Being able to work with people was the best part about the job. If I wasn't taking the pictures, I was editing them and enhancing them, then selling our best picture packages to customers."
good,The retail industry requires long hours and very volatile income and no job security.
good,I had to take a 4 dollar pay cut to transfer from one state to another
good,My day begins with checking my sales from the day before.I then do many task on the sales floor returns/payments/sales/transactions.Co-workers are great and believe in team work.Hardest part of the job is selling a repair warrenty.
good,"A typical day for me usually consisted of setting the days add, scanning ensured all displayes were set up and up to date, Reviewing the 6 Pillar Metrics of Sears (Sales, Margin, Accessories, Purchas Agreements, Credit, Customer Satification), Presented them to the stores team, and set the Goals for the day. I had to insure that all of the floor plans were up to date and make any changes in the product displaies the company required. I deligated to my merchandise and pricing team their assignments and tasks. Had to review my sales teams sales and coach on what I had observed. Coordination with other management team memberson store wide changes. The Hardest part of the Job was hireing individuals that met my standards for work quality. The most enjoyable part of the Job was when I had to rearange the entire department for the Christmas displaies, then 3 months later rearranging the entire department again for the spring set."
good,Can make alot of money if you apply yourself
good,Did a lot of different dutes with my time at Sears. Would like to see the company want to be in the retail business. Stores look the same as they did years ago.
good,"I would not recommend at that point in time, the warehouse mgmt and long time employees never saw eye to eye."
good,establishment close to my home and also great loss prevention manager.
good,Very small store and staff but most are friendly and welcoming but there is not much communication between employees and higher authorities.
good,I love this job unfortunatly due to cut backs in payroll it is very hard to service customers and complete all tasks that need to be done. You must prioritize.
good,Sears as an Merchandising Associate I was to provide customer service to the customer and always help fellow employees when available. Also I was to keep inventory of Merchandise and unload and take stock to its desired location.
good,"Sears is a sales environment where employees are meant to meet customer needs. Serving customers with current products that are in place/stock to maintaining and cleaning the department are considered the common requirements of the job. Shipments would come in twice a week, leading to unloading stock onto the floor and logging the inventory in the back."
good,Exciting place to work and never a boring time and employees get a long great.
good,"I was hired for the electronics department, which was strictly commission sales. I could only do a part time schedule which made it difficult to make any commission. If you did not make your comm's then you received a payday loan from the company which was deducted from your next paycheck. If customers returned the items, you were docked the comm's too. So Christmas was terrible for our department as folks returned the items. The cheapy promotional stuff was our downfall. No one liked those products."
good,"Overall Sears is a good company with different perks, but there are really not much moments for advancment or higher positions."
good,Tha management was an old school. The managerial offended the employess
good,"Management is terrible and the company is about to implode... Slowly eliminating departments and job positions. Under new ownership to try and breath life into the inevitable. "
good,"Hay un buentrato por parte de los administrativos y gerencia, son muy chismosos en piso de ventasel sueldo es bueno pero no suficientw"
good,en servicio al cliente es complicado trabajar cuando no tienes el apoyo de todas tus compañeras
good,The co-workers were very helpful. Manager only wanted applicants to credit cards. The system to apply took way to long and it would provide long wait times resulting in impatient customers.
good,They shut down the store after i started working there. Im well with customer service but the customers were not happy that we were shutting the store down
good,"Es muy absorbente para personas con hijos pequeños, tienen buenas prestaciones. Pero creo que el salario es bajo para las jornadas que a veces se tienen."
good,"happy with culture at target, store closed at kmart in athens. helped changed the culture in stores at target and goodyear plant. WAS voted in to top ten supervisor group twice and promoted 3 times. as an hr manager improved community relations and partnered with local school"
good,"This was Sears Outlet, so not exactly Sears. The job was part time and good as an entry level job in learning sales. It was a little boring and slow paced. The supervisors were friendly and helpful."
good,I was working two jobs and going to school so it was a good place to work because it was flexable.  I realy enjoyed working in ladies wear i like to help people pick out cloths.
good,"Salario bajo "
good,"I felt managemet to be unfair at times.  Stuck at the register by myself with long lines.  Page for assistance, no one would show up to assist.  They rate your performance by credit apps, which was hard to get as they were time consuming and due to long lines, it was useless to ask as clients thought it would be inconsiderate for the next client."
good,Work culture for sears was poor at the end of the company. Too many cost cutting measures with only focus on hitting goals as opposed to sales and customer service.
good,"Sears is a dying company. Being in dire need, I took up the role at their Mobile Pick Up station receiving 7.25 as my starting pay. Several months passed until my hard work was recognized and was bumped up to 11 hourly. "
good,Sometimes it seems as though the company itself is trying to burn itself to the ground. It alienates its employees in many ways like random switch arounds in the weekly trade plans
good,"Always be on time, the meeting are first thing in the morning. "
good,Haven't anything to add...I have a job and is paying my bills..nothing else to say..no need to continue.. I have nothing else... that's all I have..thank you..
good,"The manager was unprofessional and racist, but I often got to to work on my own. Lunch was an hour long and the work was fairly easy. Every now and then you had to deal with unreasonable requests from patients."
good,I liked helping people with their problems. I got to be an independant worker.  Got to meet new people and start up relationships. I worked with electromechanical devices and refrigerant suppplies.
good,"A difficult place to get things done, trying and trying but I don't think the company will make it. They keep downsizing by letting the wrong people go."
good,my first job was a great experience to get a feel of retail. was very slow-paced but was the first job as a teenager. gained experience with Cashiering and customer experience.
good,"Benefits could of been better for the workers, pay could of be better for better motivation. Management is great, very friendly,and helpful. Overall it’s a decent place to work at."
good,I wouldn't go back here because I didn't feel like it was a comfortable place to settle especially for new coming employees. I also had rough patches with managment.
good,"When I was there, we had to sell lawn equipment to customers. The manager was very nice, but in my opinion not experienced in sales. A typical day consisted of stocking shelves, counting inventory, and selling equipment."
good,a ok place to work but pay is very low for the amount of work you do..company is a laid back place not a lot of hustle or bustle..other then that is a ok place for high school students to work
good,"Come in get a scanner and everything was on the scanner, When it was shipment day we unloaded the trucks as a team, Occasionally would have to go out and get all buggies."
good,"Good benefits, good work/family balance, treat employees with respect. Good employee discount program, Good opportunities for advancement, pay holidays."
good,"Part-time position. Enjoyed working with fellow associates. Lots of interaction with customers, allowed opportunity to develop and perfect customer service skills."
good,"Not a bad job, lots of hours, high expectations, pretty good training, not bad management, low pay. no retirement options. 25 years and no pension offered to long term employees management makes high salaries."
good,I worked there part time during college.  I was paid minimum wage. I wasn't offered a raise until I decided to leave and work for another company.  It is a great high school.  The pay isn't enough for a college atudent.
good,"Sears #1 concern is getting customers to apply for credit. Cashiers earn bonuses for every approved credit application which is great, but management is on the employees constantly to push customers to fill out the application. They don't care if there are 50 people in line. You are still expected to offer the credit application to every customer. I worked for Sears for almost 4 years and never got a raise from the company. My only pay increase was when the minimum wage was raised."
good,Was a great company to work for until the last few years. Benefits were reduced  when merged with Kmart. Learned my computer skills at Sears as well as learning new systems.
good,"I was always being provided with new information about the products I sold. "
good,It can be fast passed and or slow depending on the day. I learned you can enjoy everyone's personality no matter who and how they act. The management is more considerate than other places. The hardest part about the job is the pay. You work hard but for such a low rate of pay you start to not care about the job anymore and it makes yourself upset because its great but not helping you pay the bills.
good,"I learned that patient was the key to handle the situation depending on the call. "
good,"I do not recommend the store due to many or all closing.  The hiring process was not very good and I was never able to get what I would be paid as a definite amount but just an ""I think this amount.""  The manager wasn't there a lot, but the assistant manager was great."
good,The biggest and best retailer was ruined by upper management.  It’s sad to say that I was there during the time while you could see the demise coming.  It was a question of when not if the company was going to fail.
good,We walked around and gained knowledge about the products and kept the stop looking presentable. We greeted everyone as they came in to make them feel comfortable
good,"It a good place to work out, a little stressful. They want the best workers, but do not pay enough. I worked there for 7 years and was at the same pay rate."
good,work environment is greatly affected by the status of the company as far as wondering if the location would be closed. that tension and pressure trickled down from the top.
good,"This was my first high school job. It was a good first job, however; I ended up working about 6 days a week and I was in high school as well as taking college classes at the same time and had to eventually quit and find a more part-time job."
good,i enjoyed work with families and children.. i learning how to do pose in different place. be creative. make sure customers happy with their pictures..
good,They expect you to get a certain amount of credit but you only see a least one person every hour. I was pregnant with high blood pressure at the time and they wouldn’t let me set down when needed at my station.
good,"This was my first job. Easiest job I’ve ever had. I quit when they started cuttin managers over bankruptcy, because the management was so poor already."
good,Pay isn't great for a two week period. But coworkers are professional. Work lounge is horrific the vending machine upstairs is more expensive and that to me raises the question of if we are working there for money or to be aired out for money considering the discount cards don't work as promised. There is barley affordable food around for break making it hard not to dip into what little paycheck is offered. Management is some what ok. They push me in a good way to fully grasp my job.
good,The co-workers made it a fun place to work. Management could be a bit of a pain from time to time. The Soft-Lines Manager was not very likable and did not do the employee reviews often. Nor would this manager give you a high enough score on your overall performance to get a pay raise. The stress of having to struggle financially is really what lead me to quit without notice.
good,I loved working here. The people I worked with were great. The employees were amazing. The work was hard but it got done. Everybody did their best to work together.
good,"I always enjoyed working with my co-workers and friends but did NOT always enjoy the slow paced environment that our store ended up having, over time. I need to stay busy and not have time to fiddle my thumbs. I need a little down time, but not more down time than busy/work time. There were NO pay raises, unless you made threats of leaving the company and even then, it was a difficult thing to get. Those that had been there 10+, 20+ years hadn't even had a raise in YEARS! get it together sears"
good,This job provided me with base knowledge of retail and operations within a company. I learned a lot about my work ethic and how to deal with poor management.
good,The clientele that this franchise attracts is slowly dwindling and the managements sets unrealistic sales goals for their employees. What started out as a lucrative part-time job that made me decent money suddenly turned into an incredible waste of time as the job is commission based. Management often forces the sales associates to work as cashiers instead of being on the floor assisting customers and making sales.
good,"Pressured to open a credit card account for every 10 customers or pressured to have customer use their sears credit card. Need to be patient with customers and need to be able to stay on your feet for long periods of time. Overall, not a bad job just stressful because managers pressure you to get customers to apply for the Sears credit card."
good,"Sears has multiple promotional opportunities within the company in various roles including Operations, Workforce, Process Improvement & Finance. Sears offers new child time off with pay in alignment with the Family Care Act."
good,"Management and Associate training is a critical component in the  success of an organizations delivery of Customer Service as well as providing goods and services."
good,"Work was tedious but the people you worked with made it workable."
good,Very productive working environment. Heartbreaking to see so many people who worked at the company for all there lives out of a job due to the closing. Glad to have met many of them.
good,"A typical day at work was just that: typical. There was rarely anything out of the ordinary for the most part, unless a machine broke down. It was as simple as come in, do your part, leave, and get paid every few weeks. Everyone was nice for the most part, but there were occasional people that were hired who were more interested in the paycheck than making friends with coworkers."
good,"Not a bad company to work for be employee dedication and giving 150 percent for very little money takes a dedicated person"
good,El ambiente de convierte sumamente pesado por el hecho de que partiendo del tiempo que se maneja en la empresa se creen jefes a pesar de que tengan la misma jerarquía que tú. Te tratan míseramente y el sueldo no compensa tu trabajo.
good,"aprendí a controlar inventarios, la disminución de mermas por departamentos e incrementar las ventas utilizando estrategias para lograr los objetivos, tienes que apegarte a las políticas de la empresa y siempre tener la camiseta puesta."
good,"The pay rate is extremely low, almost insulting. Otherwise it’s a decent job and the employees are nice and it’s a relaxed environment. The employee discount is helpful too!"
good,I enjoyed the management. Training was subpar. Hated new weekly circular day due to signage and not having all the products advertised. I enjoyed working during the holidays made your day go by fast.
good,"very straightforward you come to your station you do your work and go"
good,Es una empresa donde se aprende mucho ya que tienes que tratar al cliente y en el departamento donde me encontraba hay un buen ambiente laboral ya que en otros departamentos no lo hay
good,I started with the company as a sales associate and worked my way up to a manager. The Company did no have a retirement plan and they had incentive plans that help with credits.
good,"Commissions were given for online orders.  Some managers were helpful some were not, when help was needed.  The hardest part, was when I would say no to a customer for a return because of the policy and in some cases's the manager would ok it.  The best part was always seeing a happy customer, asking if they found everything and giving them other ideas as to what they might need."
good,"will grant you the schedule you desire, so long as you make sure they do"
good,lots o lifting n walking. building was tore down and they eventually relocated to university plaza which across the street from there original location. hours werent always guarnanteed
good,No guarantee of hours. Required to learn many different jobs. Although more hours closer to the holidays. A decent part time job. The management was understanding.
good,"This was a great job experience. I sold mattresses, vacuums and microwaves. This job was a lot of fun. The work environment was great. I learned a lot from working here."
good,"This is a fun place to work, and if the corporation situation was different, employees would feel more at ease.  Every day though is a struggle waiting to hear what else is going to show up in the news."
good,"They were good at giving breaks, and looking out for their employees. Good perks for selling credit cards. Overall was an ok place to work as my first job after childbirth."
good,"I used to enjoy going to work everyday, but as time went on it became harder and harder.      "
good,An amazing workplace just a lot of pressure but an easy job. Everyone had something to do and time went by pretty fast. The managers always seemed to busy to help though and it seemed scheduled were always messed up.
good,"This company was great to work for until 2015. From that point forward in efforts to save the company the turnover at the CEO level was extreme. Each new CEO had their own idea on how to save the company. Unfortunately, although many of them had great strategies they were bidirectionally different than the previous team. The turnover, was too quick , to implement any one strategy completely which eventually left the company bankrupt."
good,"I do not wish to review this company the operations of this company where i worked closed years and years ago, but Indeed holds you hostage on answering all of these questions."
good,"when I started at Sears (A$E Factory Service), I worked in VA and I worked a lot of overtime. I wanted to transfer to Florida, and there was a slot available, so I did. When I first arrived they had about the same work schedule I had in VA. Then they started counting the hours and cutting back the overtime. Not do to lack of work, because customers were backed up for weeks. Next thing I know, I am being asked to clock out or told to go home after a couple hours work, which I could not afford to do."
good,I advance fairly quickly with the company because of my quick learning abilities and getting to know the right people and undergoing promoting/building other people to meet their potential and beyond.
good,"As the time passed that I worked for Sears, I could see how much it was changing. It was not the same company I started with, nor was it the same company it was when I was a child. the culture changed, the items lacked craftsmanship, the warranties lacked sustainability. It was truly sad to see it heading in the direction it is going continually. I took a promotion to Sears Outlet and left to be a Sales Manager."
good,"The job expected you sign people up with sears credit cards,only thing was; customer spoke spanish so it was hard translating to those customers.  ...."
good,"Well it is closed now so do not worry about this review, but if I had to say that for a first Job it was rather bad, the hours where long and the pay while moderately good was not that helpful for me."
good,"Lo que no me gusta es que el salario es muy bajo, el horario muy pesado"
good,"Hay buen ambiente laboral, solo que los horarios son algo pesados"
good,"Sears is struggling and store closings have had an enormous effect on the company morale. It became a very stressful work environment. Although I had many opportunities in the beginning, it became obvious that it was soon to be over. The opportunity to work at home allowed me to relocate before it was too late."
good,I left for a better paying full time job with benefits. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as well as customers. I prefer to be steady to busy on a daily basis.
good,It is a great place to gain people and sales skills the worst part of the job is not working enough hours and the pay I like talking to people and driving sales
good,a unique time and unique set of circumstances; strategy direction void; faithful and devoted co-workers; time to focus on objectives in front of you and excel
good,"On a daily basis  I unloaded A truck of merchandise. Once all the item's were unloaded off the truck, we then checked all ittem's for defects or damages before we put them on the floor. After all the items's were priced and labeled, we than found place for them on the floor. During the course of my employment, I learned that different stove s and refrigerator had different feuture's and I had to find out what suited my customer's need's. Management was very laid back and do to it being such a small store, it was easy to get questions and concerns addresses.Everybody at work got along great and we all worked well together. The physical demand required of you took a tool on your body after a while but you body get's use to it and is able to recover . The best part of the job was the laid back environmental."
good,"I loved Sears.  They may have not been making plans, but you always know what your goal was and what they expected.  I did have several DM's that we were fantastic and several that had no business being a DM."
good,"Learn about the products you sell, engage customers in your department and help them find the right tools for the job they are looking to do. This was a commission based job so what you made per hour was up to you."
good,"Nice place to pass time and keeps you going. Management seems knowledgeable, people are friendly and courteous. fast pace environment for the young. all and all good place to start your training for a better future."
good,"Over all, it was a decent job. They just aren't very flexible on their hours and the management is horrible. The best part was that there was never nothing to do. If there are no customers, there's clothes to be folded, things that need to be cleaned, etc."
good,"Management treats the associates well and respectfully.  Compensation is not great and the benefits are very expensive.  Under present financial conditions, advancement a bit sketchy."
good,"While I have to say that this company is not a career company for the vast majority; they were flexible, and it got me through college... a lot of college. Most of the local staff, after a couple of years, felt like the best kinds of acquaintances and some like family."
good,"The typical work day was alright, I just did what I had to do and went home when I had to. I learned more about the customer service profession and being a floor associate."
good,"Worked in the fine jewelry department selling, Cleaning, and setting up repair for fine jewelry. Some basic merchandising skills required, and an ability in  inventory controls a must."
good,"Most of the people in the work place were friendly and easy to work with. Management was sometimes unorganized, and not prompt when dealing with digressions. I enjoyed working in hardware, it's always enjoyable to work in new departments and expand knowledge.  Work was slow a lot of the time and considering we made commission some of the employees were very competitive and it would make it difficult to make sales occasionally."
good,"They base your hours on how many credit card applications you process, that is it. I never asked customers because I believed that I shouldn't ask them to sign up for something that I wouldn't sign up for myself. Because of that, I literally went MONTHS without being scheduled a shift. Also I was a cashier, meaning they would place me at any department's register, even departments I knew nothing about, making me feel worthless. If you weren't a top credit card earner, you were nothing to management, no matter how nice they were to your face.."
good,work days was easy made friends very easy with the people i work with and also customer was very nice to me. had experience with a customer ask me to tie his necktie.
good,Managers were not organized and we had terrible customer service. The pay was good and if you like interacting with many different people for different backgrounds it's a good job to have.
good,"the workers at sears are amazing, they are fun and there is almost no interpersonal drama between workers, the store manager takes some getting used to though."
good,Good employees and good for a high school kid to get a small part-time job. Learn how to be a cashier and stock up some shelves. Don't look for a high pay grade at this place.
good,"me gusta porque aprendí a usar la caja para los cobros, la gerencia en mi opinión le hace falta estar mas organizada, la cultura laboral al parecer no la tienen muy en mente, lo difícil de ir a trabajar es llegar y ver la mala cara del jefe y lo que mas me gusto de trabajar ahí es que tengo buenos compañeros"
good,Learn my great Customer service skill here at Sears. Team work is a great part of retail without it is does not work. Management was always changing it seem that every 6 months to a year we had a shift in management.
good,Enjoyed working there for the time that i did but there were many flaws in Sears including the fact that it shutdown due to a claim of bankruptcy.The Staff at my location were not the best at managing sales not were they able to create the right sales prices until the store was beginning to close
good,Sears was fun to work at. Its a shame that the company is going under and future generations will never know what Sears was. Great training program but sad nowhere to progress due to company performance.
good,"Sears gave me the chance of dealing with different kind of customers. It has expanded my work experience dealing with people. Although I liked working there their hours to their employees were very poor. I would get about 7 hours a week, and if it was a good week only about 12. The reason why I’m looking for another job is because I need more hours."
good,There is no room for advancement. They have employees that have been there for 15 years and not given the opportunity to advance. They let people go for simple things and do not consider that you're top performer and you're a great team player. Although they always want to give you duties outside of your responsibilities.
good,This place is nothing more than a stepping stone to something better. Stores are closing left and right with no signs of change and there are reducing the workforce by a ridiculous rate.
good,"With the frequency of Management changes came different Management styles. Must be able to adapt quickly and efficiently to change."
good,"I can see why it had to close., Ithey had managers in and out in a matter of a few months and most did not have answers to many questions  the employees had"
good,it was a stress less job the manager was very capable and understanding the pace was slow and the other employees were very helpful there were few arguments among employees
good,Not a job you want if you're looking to take care of your family. The pay is decent only if you're great at sales. On average a paycheck is $500 with base pay. Not a job to have if you have a family.
good,Total control of the stock and distributing goods to customers. Very relaxed environment easy approach to moving customers goods from warehouse to vehicle.
good,it is a good place to work if the management team would treat you with respect and as an adult. turn-over is extremely high. the work is there some long hours required.
good,"Working there was usually very independent and quiet. We were discouraged from speaking with our co-workers and were preferred to figure out solutions ourselves rater than ask questions. It sounds silly, but sometimes it could be physically taxing and emotionally exhausting but the other associates definitely made it worth working there. I learned to build a good work ethic and the importance of punctuality."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I was able to help all employees in 3 different lines of business. I learned and help train new hires before and after the nesting period..
good,"My ideal work environment is one that is centered around working as a team and that allows everyone’s talents to flourish. When I was researching your company, your desire to cultivate each of your employees’ skills was very impressive to me. I find that I work best in an environment that is empowering and positive, no matter what the work is that I’m doing. Some of which was missing at time of working with Sears."
good,"I would only recommend working here if you are a teenager needing some experience for a first job. If you are over 18 you are wasting your time working for the company unless you are in management or higher up. Pay is terrible, no raises."
good,"This job is not for everyone you will develop tough skin while you are working in this type of environmrnt its a call center, but after you learn the protection agreements it became easier. Always making changes..."
good,"If you are young and need a first job it's a great place to start. I was payed minimum wage, which as a teen wasn't a problem. You can meet some great people. Good way to learn how to work as a team. Does have different working hours each week so it's hard to plan things in advance."
good,"Job duties expanded into many fields for little pay and benefits, management could have communicated more effectively with workers. Allowed to work independently and felt trusted there, overall not bad."
good,It was a good first job but they stopped giving me hours because I wasn't getting enough credit. so by the time I left I was working like 9 hours a week.
good,the culture at Sears was fun and very team oriented. management was knowledgeable and friendly. The hardest part about the job is holiday hours. I mostly enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,During this period I was undergoing extreme stress and health concerns. Because of this I missed a few shifts and was subsequently fired two weeks before Christmas.  It's a cold-hearted thing to fire someone two weeks before Christmas when you already know the entire store and staff will be let go in 2 months time.
good,Sears was a job to make ends meet.  It was very laid back and enjoyable.  Fun.  I don't believe the company is yet there.  I enjoyed it.  Learned a lot of new things.
good,The work environment is friendly and fun while being productive with and around co-workers and getting the job done at the same time. I like to make my work day and enjoyable experience.
good,"Very nice company to work for, but did not keep up with the times. Did not provide enough training for employees at store level. Many times unrealistic expectations."
good,"It was basically stock selves, so after a while you kind of know where everything is at. Then that makes the job easier to work in that store. I tend to catch on quick."
good,"It is no mystery that Sears isn't doing well as a company, which consequently affects the consistency of work hours and the quality of the pool of management personnel they have available. Associates work hard and the skeleton crew atmosphere can in a strange way compel a sense of team unity not found in retail stores with larger teams and better equipment. If you are a part time worker, the ideal time to work at Sears would be on temporary seasonal terms when hours are available. For retail managers that enjoy ""crisis"" situations, Sears might be an adventure to put on your resume."
good,"There are many wonderful, smart, talented people that I have worked with at Sears during my career. There have been some financial struggles overall, but still a good place to work."
good,i worked for sears auto center. they had room to advance with learning more of the cars and other techs would help out a lot. you could move up going to certification classes
good,"This was my first job and I was seasonal. If you've never had a job before you might as well try there. The company has been dying for years though so hours are mostly sparse, and they love to push credit apps on people."
good,"Easy job treated well but too much drama among  workers. Constant fighting among workers. New managers constantly. Just when things start to run smoothly and no favoritism a manager will be sent elsewhere and bring in new manager. Health insurance a joke and 401K,basically no benefits."
good,"Boring, but it seemed okay for the time..."
good,"Collaborative , Entrepreneurial, and open environment. Great people with can do attitudes."
good,"you did your job tire changer or battery  tech .the manager taught you some tricks of the trade .he taught you how to use other equipment too .he showed you how to use other tire machines and balancers"
good,"management is terrible"
good,for the most part the staff was great.  some of the management at some locations were difficult to talk to.  Sometimes I had the role of manager on Duty where I would take all  manager calls and a lot more pressure / responsibility but there was no difference in pay for the large amount of responsibilty placed on me without my approval.
good,"I worked here as a part time Backroom Associate for a little under a year. Typical retail. Pay was minimum wage, bi-weekly, no health insurance. A ton of hours during holiday season, working Black Friday was mandatory at the store I worked at. Mandatory half an hour breaks if you worked longer than a 5 hour shift. Most of my co-workers were awesome to work with, but a revolving door due to the nature of the industry. There was a pay ""freeze"" when I worked at Sears, no raises given."
good,"The store has great management but the corporate management team in Hoffman Estates is a disaster and seem to be running the company into the ground. "
good,Well now that the store is closed there's really not much to say about it. We had a good team though. Most of the management was fair enough and the staff I worked with was hardworking and nice. Like every other job there's good and bad customers. I learned a lot in terms of retail experience during those 2 years.
good,"If you are in school, Sears is a good job for part time hours. Low stress, but quick paced on occasion. Flexible, and good management. Also you get an employee discount."
good,"Due to the fact that Sears as a whole is generally trending towards closing, employees are not paid well and are not given a sufficient amount of hours per week."
good,Inventory and put away sorting and equipment oparater are my skills have a high school diploma general labor are my job searching fast to learn and fast pace
good,customer service was great and helping all the people in the community with all their appliance and lawn and garden needs was great. it was a lot of later nights and all holidays
good,One of the absolutely worst run stores I had ever worked in. So much was going on within that store that I can't even begin to touch base on any single major issue. This particular store actually announced closure within a month of my 2 weeks notice.
good,Good part-time job for my situation at the time. Friendly store manager and coworkers.  Lunch breaks and time-off were granted when needed. Hours weren't readily available
good,"High stress, long hours and lack of flexibility for personal time needed off when dealing with family illness.  The company didn't give time off for a father in-law that was dying before I put in a two-week notice to quit."
good,"The store I work for is understaffed and everyone is underpaid for the jobs they do. We never know, day by day, if our store is going to be the one that will close next. Hours assigned are totally dependent upon weekly sales i.e. they charge every week...you can rarely make plans in your personal life."
good,Sears rapidly proving to be a forgotten player in the retail industry. It provided me with customer service opportunities not found at the competitors and developed me with loyal customer following.
good,"At Sears, you were allowed to gain more hours only if you were able to sign a lot of customers up for a Sears credit card. This made the nature of the job a bit competitive. Even if you were doing your job correctly as a cashier but were unable to sign many customers up for a credit card you were penalized the next week with less hours on the schedule. My coworkers were very nice but the managers weren't  as they were frustrated with the lack of credit card applications coming in."
good,"Management seems to be confused on how to effectively manage assigned personnel to ensure maximum production of sales.  Management is not willing to listen to viable employee complaints to better work performance, sales, etc..."
good,Many employees fell they had been left in the dark regarding the current stand point of sears. News of finalizing closing dates surprised many employees.
good,Working directly with customers photographing them and then selling them their portraits.  Photos can be printed out immediately or ordered in higher quality from the lab
good,everyday was a gamble on whether you had a job to stay in or not. priorities of job was more o sell insurance than to actually repair appliances for customers
good,"Because of my position there was always something going on/something to do. I either monitored CCTV or inspected in the Auto Shop or escorted money drops to the safe to name a few. Management was alright. The hardest part of the job was when unable to make an apprehension , the most enjoyable part of the job was saving the company loss and decreasing shrink"
good,A brief but productive employment experience gave me insight into retail sales with a very large company.  Their recent closure demonstrates the new market environment and the need for companies to remain relevant to their customers.
good,"My typical day at work, I worked from 600 am to 200pm.  I would get I would clock in by the computer and then there would be about 6 to 7 of employees to get a devise and head to our section, which my area was the womens or mens department.  I was there to mark down the price tags and put up sale prices.  After we would straighten out the clothes from what the night crew didn't finish.  I was able to learn the shoe department, loss preventions department, jewrely department and hardward department.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the children's department clean.  The best part of the job was when the regular customers would come back and recognize you.  That means you left an impression for them to remember you."
good,"Loved working for Sears. Hours were nice, benefits were nice, however, there were some messy people with little ambition to progress who were not team players."
good,I mainly left due to feeling like I couldn't help people due to how I was trained. Transferring calls to sales even though thats not why they called. I just didn't feel helpful to the people who were calling.
good,"I learned how to work as a team player on this job by working with other ethnicity, It was a fun relaxing job and easy to do. My boss was nice and took time to talk with me."
good,Very long hours/ driving all over north/west Suburbs and Chicago Illinois area / cleaning carpet and upholstery from sun up to sun down / dealing with lots of pets
good,"every day parts and service orders 10 to 15 calls,and as technician to install and also we would order parts per going to the customers home and diagnosing the repair for all major brand appliances such as washer/ dryer /refrigerator /icemakers/ microwave /hot water heaters,etc to include GE whirlpool frigidaire lg samsung  etc"
good,"This place hardly gets costumers and when they do its not the nice ones. Slow paced. Prices are okay for products, not a great selection of clothes or brands."
good,"They were closing the store so I was just hired to help them close it, it was fun they let me work on most of soft lines which is registers, MCA and shoe department."
good,"No matter how hard you work,there is no opportunity to move up. They hire from outside, not inside. I feel that is the reason, that sears is going out of business"
good,"When you come in the morning, you start with your emails..see if there are any issues and then you have to run reports to see how the stores did the day before... In between you are running into meetings and review the Ads or Digital Ad to confirm that the correct item and promo price look correct.  You have to load items for the week that you are working in to confirm that pricing goes though... Run bar graph reports to confirm the dates and price are correct for the up coming week and if there is any issue you can go back and make any correction....etc..."
good,"Sears has awesome people employed thoughout corporate and the stores. They may be the main reason I have stayed with the company so long; it certainly isn't becauseof the pay or benefits.  It's sad Sears has been too far behind the 8 ball and it's unlikely they will ever recover in sales and market share.  I sincerely hope they do, and sometime soon.  However, I'm ready to move to a more stable environment."
good,"Working here was fun, I started here when I just got out of high school and they co- workers were extremely wonderful to be around and there was always something to do."
good,Worked with a good team and liked the job.  Supported inventory management and retail store associates on inventory issues.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with roll out of systems that were not 100% ready.
good,It wasn't a place that could be relied on for income. There was not many things to do but the pressure of obtaining sales were ridiculous. There is a reason why this placed closed down.
good,Operations was still using a green screen when I left.  Difficult environment using antiquated systems to review 100+ accounts on a weekly basis to try to make somewhat of an EBIT.
good,"The work was easy enough to be accomplished within a few hours. Unloading and stocking the warehouse with a forklift. The management wasn't all that great, they never wanted to hear new ideas or new ways of doing things throughout the warehouse."
good,"When I started I learned a lot. It was stressful since they weighed ability based on enrollment of customers into SEARS Credit card. Most of management was helpful. I was kept on after holiday and moved into accounting office. I answered phones, counted down the drawers, and made money and currency to deposit. I based my low ratings on when my son suffered a traumatic eye injury and was hospitalized. I called in and the manager that answered was suppose to put my call into my immediate supervisor or input message. She failed to and I was terminated."
good,"I have learned that retail work is not for everyone. You can not let things upset you, or take things personally. You have a table full of tee shirts, folded and it looks great. You come back from your fifteen minute break and that same table is destroyed. The most enjoyable thing about my job working at Sears is when you get the chance to really help a member and they are so thankful. Being tall helps. Management is helpful  a  lot of the time. If you are trying to get new merchandise out to the floor, and set up a really nice display showing off the new merchandise. You can go to your manager and ask for help, ideas, what would you do. How do you make this display catch the shoppers eye? Things like that."
good,"Great company to learn and grow. "
good,"I provided customer service in the apparel department part time and ran a cash register.  This was a temporary job right out of high school.  I learned how to deal with customers, run a cash register, as well as build lasting relationships with fellow coworkers."
good,"A typical retail position, unpaid lunch breaks and constantly overworked. Sometimes there wouldnt be enough people and you  have to work longer hours to cover others shifts."
good,I learned how to run a cash register.  A typical day you would get no more than 200-300 customers all day.  Very very slow paced.  The best part of the job was talking with nice customers/regulars.  The hardest part of the job was staying busy all the time or dealing with mean customers.
good,"I usually work in escalation. Communication from customer to the vendor or supplier, to make sure the you can fulfill the needs of the customer."
good,This was a great starting point on B2B sales experience. The manager I had was amazing and I learned so much from him and other members of my team. No advancement opportunities.
good,"When I am doing something I enjoy I very hard to have the job don and when I am with the right people to work with thing,s run  smoother.You should enjoy when you work."
good,The days seemed to zip by. Liked staying busy. Work experience is better when your direct report is GREAT!!!! The most enjoyable part of the job....No micro management!
good,"A typical day at Sears was a balance of ringing customers through the till, tidying up the work space, and aiding the customers in finding product. Co-workers were nice and friendly and management was flexible. However with the current state of the company you can see that it would be better to take your skills elsewhere."
good,Typical day starts at 7am and leave around 6:30 or 7pm.  Direct management  were good to work with.  Upper management are making strange decisions that is impacting the livelihood of current employees.
good,Sears was a nice place for my first job it was a quick pace job that was fun at times and stressful at others. i had to stock racks and mark clothing with prices and discounts .
good,"As retail work goes, K Mart wasn't bad.  I loved being a department manager when I worked there.  When I went into Asst. Management it was a different story.  No life/work balance, and not nearly enough pay for the work you are required to do."
good,Great people to work with across the nation. Little to no job security at this time.  Executive management turnover is extremely high. Benefits are extremely expensive.
good,"A typical day at work was competitive, stressful and repetitive. I've learned not to be manipulated by management. The workplace culture was inconsistent. The hardest part of the job was stressing over credit applications, customer feedback, and not knowing if my job was secure. Most enjoyable part of the job was the discount at the food court, and be a 'floater' because you could move around to different departments for the day."
good,"Manejan un buen fondo de ahorro, descuentos y ventas de empleado"
good,"In efforts to bring profitability to a flagging company, Executive management chose to cut the earnings for their biggest money makers - the appliance salespeople. This resulted in a atmosphere of cut-throat sales in order to make a semblance of former salary. There was also a rapid flight of these and medium range salepeople to other opportunities."
good,A typical day at work is ringing of customers and trying to get them to apply for a credit card in which some dont have time to and can be the hardest part of the job.
good,They started getting this new management at this specific store and everything was out of place. Several times the workers wouldn't be on the same page and would leave you with this confusion on what exactly to do. Management needs to work on better communication with the employees there.
good,"Sears has provided me with work experience in retail that I havent had before. It is a great spot for young people who are looking for their first job or someone who wants to gain work experience.. It has giving me lots of experience working on the floor, as a merchandizer, as a reciever, and as part of the inventory team. It is sad for me to say this but I am now looking for more stable job. Also looking for a better job that I can grow into."
good,It was not even a job. You stood around waiting for someone to come in and hoping you could sale the highest price mattress. I work on commission. So you were always competing with the other sales associates. Dog eat world of commission sales.
good,The particular branch that I was working a was bought out by a private owner. As soon as the new owner took over salary and commission percentage was lowered without letting any of the workers know. Store did not have a manager for almost 6 months. Myself as well as other employees took on all manager duties.
good,Working here was very busy all the time the pharmacy was very small as far as co workers so friendships were easy to create. Learning all about different medicine was very interesting and  educational however again I found myself in a career battle.
good,It was alright at first but I was a college student and they frequently worked me like I was full time. My last schedule before I quit was 55 hours with a straight seven day shift. You're only treated well when you're selling a lot. There's not much traffic in Sears anymore so it's hard to make any money. They treat the people in tools terribly.
good,"Not the best place because of management but okay with coworkers. It's best if you are patient overall because customers there like to put up a hassle, and management can often times be unresponsive."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Es un empresa seria que me abrio las puertas y gracias asu apoyo dure dos años ahi , apoyo gerencial bueno.solo que hay mucha rotacion de personal"
good,"As a backroom associate there is always something to do.  Staging product for pickup, web orders, loading customer purchases, unloading trucks, and opening boxes.  Sometimes can be understaffed and can be hard to keep up with everything that might come along.  If you have the right group of co workers job can be fun.  Be prepared to have a a lot of different things going at once.  Flexible hours.  Never had an issue with asking for time off."
good,"The people were great to work with but the dying company and people giving you their view on it every day was depressing ..................... The cashes are old and turn off sometimes, the clients are elderly so keep that in mind if you are an impatient person"
good,"It's hard to work for a failing company.  Between layoffs and bad management it's hard to work there. I have nothing else to say, the job sucked and I would never recommend working there."
good,"I helped maintain upkeep of dressing rooms, the store floor, and cash raps. One of my enjoyments was getting to see my fellow coworkers. I must say I worked with some really wonderful people. I took a lot of pride in my job and my work ethic. I feel ones work ethic is a direct reflection of ones self. I continuously made laps around the store and stock rooms checking on things and seeing if something needed to be done."
good,Enjoyed the staff at the location. Regardless of which direction the company goes the people who work the floor are amazing. They deserve much credit for their work.
good,I was so happy to work with the people at sears they where close to one in anther and very helpful. there where things like security alerts to learn and use because it was a large store there was  lot to learn and I greeted customers. well having  the ability to ring up customers and tag items and stock also take innovatory beginning of the month.
good,"greet customers , find out their service needs , write up work orders. keep customers updated on status of work being done. Answer phones, provide quotes, schedule appts."
good,I was trained in two days and thrown out to the wolves. i was expected to be great at selling credit cards and to figure everything out as i went. Managers stayed in their offices unless called out. Employees tattled on each-other out of boredom. Very slow environment.
good,Sears as a comapny was a good place to work overall. the company has been changing and  i left before more changes. The new management structure was the main reason i left.
good,"for non management position great  flexible hours, Team work and positive attitude among field employees. If there was a job security i wold love to retire from this job"
good,"Hay que tener muy bien mentalizado que aquí se viene a dar un servicio con presentación formal y elegante, tener un conocimiento de las prendas adecuadas para el cliente o lo que el necesita, también ofrecer servicios adicionales que le podrían servir al cliente mas adelante."
good,"The most pleasant was coexistence , the manager's confidence with the workers, independence often to carry out projects and suggest ideas."
good,the mangers didn't know how to handle the customers . I learned how to have better customer service. the hardest part is when the people didn't get what they wanted
good,"-help customers."
good,"It is a good place for seasonal workers, but not for careers. Good start up job, but not enough business to make a living. Very inconsistent pay and just not enough sales to make it."
good,Job is ok .  It does not have room for advancement.  The pay is moderate.  I think that they need to advertise more because the base pay is low.  Also returns on merchandise can be difficult to deal with.
good,"A good place to work if you live downtown and if they don't go bankrupt in the near future. "
good,"Get to work with a variety of people in the business place and with the public,  Customer service oriented and ever changing to meet the needs of the business,"
good,Worked hard everyday. Was trying to become something big in the company. Made sure to leave the day with a smile on my face and make sure everyone was happy with me.
good,Each Day A Major Focus Is Getting Credit Cards Opened And Member Feedback. With This Focus From Corporate It Is Very Hard To Keep Moral Up And Positive.
good,"The job at Sears was perfect while completing school. This location made every attempt possible to balance work with continuing my education. I typical work day started with me going to work and processing all overnight web orders."
good,"Sears is a great place to learn the trade of appliance repair. But they will work you to death. "
good,"Dynamic, everyday brought new challenges, mastered the skill of multi-tasking and prioritizing.  Great people to work with. Open concept floor plan, no cubicles"
good,"a lot of work but little or no backup/ support team, drove an old work van that was ready to kick the bucket. when I worked for bestbuy I always drove a new work van"
good,"It was a nice comfortable work place, nice and good coworkers and nice work flow. I like that it was lively and no drama and customers were good as well. Not really much I can say good place to work at."
good,Overall it is a okay place to work for. But there is no place to grow. Salary is  very poor. They made me work long hours and never gave me a raise despite my excellent work ethic.
good,"The good thing about this company is they try to be as flexible as they can with your college/school schedule. Management is very poor here, they are organized, but they are not friendly. Almost every department has a head manager that is extremely rude to not only the employees but to the customers as well. You get the overall feeling that no one likes their job and no one wants to be there, which makes it difficult to enjoy your shift. Positive is that they pay really well in the appliance department as far as commission goes, however if youre not selling merchandise, be prepared to not have a paycheck."
good,Stores employ caring and hard working associates with a strong commitment to customer satisfaction. All levels of the team participate in a variety of processes that enhance the customer experience.
good,I personally hate working in retail and only took a job at sears to hold me over until i found something better. No one can live off minimum wage therefore the pay SUCKS; especially in comparison to the attitudes of the customers.
good,Hard to make any money when the slowest store in the district is moved to full commision.  mangment is always help full but cant make customers go to the store.
good,"Busy work day I was pregnant during this job, they really didn't care and still had me do hard labor. Not really flexible with hours. Would ask for a specific day off in advance time and still had me work. Other then that it was decent."
good,I have many great experiences working at SHC.  The company in in the midst of a transformation.  Great work-life balance and flexibility.  Good opportunities for upward mobility.
good,was a fun place to work but company was going down so things got hard for everyone. our location ended up closing like allot of locations did. made some long time close friends and great experience but company didn't seem to care about its employees.
good,"There isn't anything that makes this job stand out instead of knowing you have a job. Easy, slow at times and sometimes long is the best way. you make friends with the co-workers but where i was you were to close and not everyone is worth trusting"
good,its a good place to work for a student or someone just trying to make a little extra cash. the pay is low and so are the hours. but the people you work with are nice
good,"you'll learn what you need to chill place to work when I was there, not sure about now. managers during my time at sears helped when you needed them.."
good,"Sears has no shortage of talented and passionate associates. Unfortunately the highest levels of leadership have failed to commit to  any specific strategy or direction; instead opting to ""throw ideas at the wall and see what sticks"". Most of the projects and initiatives are simply spinning their wheels and getting no where. Not willing to try anything that might truly move the needle. No true north; no true identity. Trying to be all things to all people and beat Amazon on a budget is simply not working. Cannot cut their way to success. Even as the business is failing, refusal to pick a strategy and truly go ""all in"" has hurt this legacy company."
good,"bon emploi, les employés sont agréables et super gentil."
good,"A typical day working at Sears putting up sale signs, operate cash register, process online orders and drive workplace sales"
good,enjoyed assisting members and dealing with the day to day issues but it was hard to move up in the company if it all possible and the stipulations were to much for me.
good,"regretfully Sears may be failing and my belief is they do not care for their employees, which they should, they are the current representatives of the store, no training, expected to do a job without directions and rewards.  There would be less turnover  of employees if they were given some hope of a career, better pay.  Most of the people I worked with have been there for years, some 5 and 7 years, without any pay increase except for government minimum wage increases.  Shame."
good,Really discouraging to enjoy working /repairing vehicles but to deal with the The constant stress of knowing the store was going to close down and dealing with individuals whom gossip cutthroat smack talking and not being professional and management team that was all mouth and no actions pritty much there to collect a pay check.and the constant self audit on pay checks to ensure you were going to get paid for all work being done . Sorry Sears can't have people calling the shots if they never been on the bottom
good,"At Sears I was the Hardlines manager( lawn and garden, electronics, appliances,tools and mattresses)."
good,"College job Just starting career, telemarketing is always a rough job but I was young and upbeat and calls were all established customers, Free Lunches were great but not being invited to employee appreciation days when you are located in the store is not fun."
good,The position speaks for itself. Warehouse work as well being a receiver of merchandise. Also received a forklift license and operated same quite extensively. An incentive to better oneself.
good,"I worked for Sears while I was still taking classes. They provided a flexible schedule and did not invade with my classes at all. The work was run of the mill retail, nothing special (good or bad)."
good,On the phones everyday with limited company help or involvement.  incentives were more like small candy bars then even a warm pat on the back.  not much in then way of incentives. focused on metrics
good,i was cashier at a sears in a mall with almost no customers. the mall was old and run down and i was going to school at the time so it was perfect for me to balance school and work.
good,If you can't sell well you can not work here and should not ever work here! co workers are fun but management is not good nor is the actual work if you hate retail dont work here
good,"too much expected of us not enough staff to complete the tasks, manager moises was such a mean assertive man with a temper, he plays favorites, and always bashes the hard workers to pick up the slack of others that he would not bother them as much"
good,Always working with customers to help make sure they left with the tools they needed to finish desired tasks. Mangers were very helpful and resourceful.
good,Creo que tiene oportunidades para mejorar en beneficios para sus empleados y clientes.
good,"Started off in the men's clothing Dept , that position was a little tedious folding pants all day. But great for a high school kid such as myself at the time. I did get promoted from clothing to Lawn and Garden where I was able to expand my knowledge and sell high ticket items such as patio furniture ,Lawn Mowers, Riding Mowers, and Garden tools. Great for high school kids and up skilled Business Admins."
good,"Could handle the workplace better, and actually teach the managers how to use a register and promote credit rather than yell at employees for not preforming up to their standards."
good,This company pays well but is very stressful for a manager and requires much of your time. The pay if very good but in the end you may not feel it was worth it because of the culture in some facilities. It is really a cut throat company this is very shaky at this time.
good,hourly pay plus bonus per job if your a tech 2 or above. mostly did oil changes and tires. fluid services and brakes mostly done by tech 2s and up. tire day was most annoying as we had to unload the truck and stock the tires.
good,"Poor sales, made it hard to make money to live. Poor management and training made it hard to do your job at times. Co-workers were mostly nice and friendly to work with."
good,"Its retail. Low pay, benefits are lacking. You are over worked but that up to you if you want to be a great worker or just get by. Good for students or first job."
good,"I have worked for this company for 13 years. During that time I have sold jewelry, lead a jewelry team and a pricing team, worked on the pricing team and been an mca. Over the years I have gained valuable knowledge and confidence from my job. Many changes have occurred at my job over the years and the things I enjoyed as part of my job are no longer priorities."
good,"I loved my position I had there , however we had to close our doors , at this time I do not feel that Sears has any type of job security and feel that it wont be long that all Sears will be closed. I very much enjoyed the people I worked with along with some of our regulars and they will be terribly missed"
good,Immediate Co-Workers and Lower/Middle Management were willing to assist each other when ever possible to satisfy the customers concerns to keep the them as a customer but the hands of the employees are presently tied due to the financial state of the company.
good,When the Store you are working at is closing they make you reinterview for your position. Even if you happen to find the same position they will not let you transfer until your store closes. This could take up to 4  months and the tranfering store will NOT wait for you. Plus to much Favoritism goes along in the hiring process with store managers.
good,I have worked with sears for more than a year and it is a place where there will be lot of tensions in the project and fully stressful workplace ..finally I Left the company now.
good,"I worked at Sears as an Office Associate which is a hybrid cash office/HR position responsible for daily deposits, safe fund access, and the like. They pay minimum wage, which in my state was $7.25; Sears pays their hourly employees significantly less than their leading competitors, such as Walmart and Target. Most big retailers have made the bump up into the (at least) $9.00/hr or so range. High turnover is typical of retail, of course, but the turnover at my Sears store was on another level entirety. My advice? Go somewhere else, do the same job, and get paid more (and at this point, probably have more job security)."
good,I have acquired many skills at Sears that have broadened my selling abilities. I have strengthened my customer service abilities by working in different commission areas at Sears.
good,Pick and Choose Employee to be promoted/ favoritism / cross trained in every department / Deal with  Irate costumer everyday/I like some of the people that I worked with.
good,"The job itself was great, my direct manager was amazing. Policies and higher up managment made doing our job very difficult and felt that our opinion and input on our daily tasks did not mean anything."
good,They need to change something. Management is disconnected and they don't have service in mind when addressing budget or productivity. I hope service gets sold.
good,This work of sales help me to be more confident this was a great experience.The most enjoyable part of the job was meet people with more experience than me and teach me more.
good,Sears is one of those jobs your child works at for their first job. It doesn't pay well and its slow paced. The job itself does not require much skill or knowledge to do and at the end of the day you do not feel like you really did anything. Perfect for the lazy worker but not recommended if you want to make a living.
good,"The company unfortunatley has been through rough times since the merger of Sears and Kmart. The CEO has not done a good job and eventually the company will be disolved. At store level though, great enviroment. My superiors are well educated people with alot to teach. Care deeply about helping the company succeed and to teach all associates as much as possible. They become of part of your family and I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world!!"
good,More clear direction from upper level Management.  I was able  to order merchandise based on the customers need.  Able to contact buyers negotiate for future order.
good,"Very little hours they're only busy during the holidays. Management i had sucked, and one went to jail for stealing company money. Not a good place to work for."
good,"The typical day was greeting customers and helping them throughout the store finding things they were interested in buying. We were required to ask them to apply for credit cards which was a hassle after while. Job was overall good, but not the best."
good,Exciting place to work with much competition and the opportunity to learn new skills. For instance I attained the ability to communicate more effectively due to having to deal with many consumers daily.
good,"Several stores are closing leaving associates looking for other opportunities & employment.  They are running stores with less than the bare minimum of resources,  the employees & customers are seeking alternatives in employment & shopping.  There are so many hard working employees who are staying strong,  I would be one if my store wasn't closing,  I wish them all the best & hope the company can turn things around."
good,"Working at Sears was cool at first because I am in high school and the schedule was fairly flexible. However, it got so boring after being there for five months. I only made minimum wage  (7.27/hr) which wasn't enough for the things I had to deal with almost daily from rude customers and demanding managers. Even people that had been there for 1 year or more and worked hard never got raised from 7.25. They were always low staff and expecting us cashier's to run EVERYTHING down stairs. My job description only said cashier but it turned into much more than that...and for 7.25 I wasn't willing to do it. I quit and got a higher paying job."
good,Quand j'ai travailler au sears je me sentais jeune car tout le monde etais plus vieu mais jai bien aimer mon experience car il y a une bonne esprit d'equipe et jai appris beaucoup a utiliser la caisse et comme tout mes autres travail je travailler avec soin
good,I loved working for the portrait studio.  I built a great customer base and a great team while working there.  There something wonderful about capturing a great portrait of a child and a family.  The hardest part was when portraits didn't come out well or was lost in shipping.
good,During my time I found the associates were wonderful but a lot of demands by the management considering its a minimum wage job. At times very hectic due to organizational over sights.
good,The people I worked with made it worth working for and being there. Management worked well around my school schedule and I was quite happy for some time.
good,"It was a physical and fast paced job, learning how to run dot coms, providing service for customer pick-ups. The management wasn't great, the people I worked with was all around people I had no issue working with them."
good,"it is a good company to work for, however change and communication of changes could be better. Managers are open to hear improvements but the culture needs a fix, lots of old employees stuck in the old ways of doing things"
good,i definitely enjoy working there. the people are great and the experience has been great. i have learned a lot while i have been there.
good,Extremely busy with ongoing changes to floor plans. I learned a great deal about AutoCAD and JDA.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with.
good,"If you like to repair this is not the place for you."
good,"When I started they spoke about changing the culture of the company. Managers were called coach and it was a good environment to work. Things changed soon after. Wages were frozen and we were only able to hire people in at minimum wage which made it hard to motivate the team year after year. Long term employees still stuck around but they were eliminated at the end of each year through job elimination. So in the end you had people only made minimum wage, with little experience and no extra long term leaders. I loved the members who shopped our store and the fellow managers."
good,"I had to leave this job because it got to a point where I was only getting 4 hours per week and that was just unacceptable. The managers only seemed out for themselves and it was obvious they weren't trained well enough, if at all. My department was a good one with good people, but the quotas they gave us were unachievable with the flow of people we were getting through the store. It got to a point where management was telling us to make up surveys and recaps. And that was coming from not only the electronics manager, but also the training manager and store manager."
good,Sears was a great company to work for unfortunately over the past 10 years things have taken a turn for the worst cost cutting dropping employees benefits taking away sick time and dropping employees income
good,Enjoyed working with the public. Great employees to work with. Fast pace enviorment. The work hours were perfect for me.
good,work environment is set as entry level. A very welcoming environment to come to everyday to work. Wonderfull managers and completely trustworthy with information about job and personal information
good,"It was a good job to keep in high school. But once I realized there were better opportunities, I just simply couldn't work there much longer. The pay was not the best, but enough for a teenager like I said."
good,Overall good store. Very tidy. Only discrepancy is asking 16 - 18 year olds to pitch selling credit cards. Talk about pressure. How do you expect a teen to sell credit to an adult.
good,I always received good hours here but the management was pretty pushy about metrics and numbers we had to meet. I done pretty well at meeting my numbers but still the principle of hearing the same lecture everyday about the same thing got pretty repetitive. On the Few months I did struggle on meeting my goals my job was at a constant threat.
good,"easy money. little commission not enough money. Several locations in major cites. Great sales and deals on major appliances, not a career just a stepping stone."
good,"Most of the management are brilliant, fun people to work with who try their best to increase the enjoyment of their associates in the workplace. I got to interact with a wide variety of individuals every single day, and no day was the same. Sears has a weak, fragmented training program, but I was able to learn about swift transaction completion, upstanding customer service in the face of any interaction, and close teamwork in order to complete direct goals. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the people I work with, they are all interesting and likable. The most difficult aspect of my current job is balancing corporate desires with high management desires, as they repetitively clash, and the lack of solid trust following the chain of command to all be on the same page."
good,Typical day was selling lawn and garden equipment also tools and accessories to work.  Also studying online courses to keep up with the latest sears products...the inside and out of mechanics of products...also going to meetings of demonstration of equipment.  Handling money and securing product protection services were also important.  Above all making the customer happy so that they would return
good,"A typical day at Sears is interesting because you never know what's going to place, it's always changing and the customers are all walks of life. The hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by customers because something doesn't meet the standards of what they need or want. With management I think the line of communication could be a little better. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you make with the other employees."
good,"Depending on which sears you work in the clientele is very different, meaning you will encounter all kinds of customers.  Management and the job itself is alright,  not bad not great.  The customers are always the worst part."
good,You have to be a people person and team player to work here.  The hours are very long and fluctuate.  I was able to build a team that was very successful.  The hardest part of the job was missing most holidays with family.
good,"After my previous employer the Silver Club closed, I applied for and got hired at Sears in the Meadowood Mall. There was little job security - salespersons and cashiers were expected to meet daily quotas. If these figures fell short, so did the hours scheduled for any given work week. Co-worker moral was quite low, too."
good,"Unload trucks and get a customers order ready to be picked up"
good,Nice people to work with.  Pay should be more for the amount of work that is required. Should  train employees on a register instead of a computer.
good,"Daily interactions with my employees, store managers and 3rd party vendors pertaining to facility related work and expenses. Hardest part of the job has been store closings and people losing their job due to work force reductions."
good,This job isn't very hard. Trying to get someone to sign up for a Sears card is kinda hard since everyone thinks Sears is going to close. The management can be good but some are worse than others. I think it is a good job if you're in school or just looking for something easy to do but advancing to something more than a cashier seemed like  it wasn't even an option
good,"Working here I have acquired lots of team working and great leadership skills to get the job done. The more responsibilities put upon me gave me the confidence and will to get the job done. Furthermore, with these tools I have  the ability and needs for almost every job who's seeking employers."
good,"works with my family obligations and traveling for family medical necessities. In 2017 with my family's medical situation haveing improved,I am able to seek a more financially secure position."
good,"As a former appliance sales associate my typical day if I was on the opening shift started with our morning meeting, where all staff and managers came together for a readiness meeting. We were then dismissed to our various departments to prepare to meet our guests."
good,"Every one there is nice. However, the managers are misleading during the interviews, the job is not what I anticipated. They cut corners and are under-staffed. The company is number based. If you don't have good numbers, you will get low amount of hours a week."
good,"Not the worst job in the world. Pretty much show up, work, and collect a pay check. Not much to look forward to. Somewhat flexible with schedules but you will work pretty much every weekend."
good,"While at Sears, the biggest difficulty was the resistance to change and lack of consistent executive management. There are many intelligent and talented people at this company and hopefully if the employee development improves here."
good,"I have learned a lot about the role of a buyer and have developed a lot of skills while working for Sears. The main concern is not knowing what the future of Sears may hold. The other downfall is that every year the cost of health insurance goes, but salary increases do not happen."
good,Working for Sears was a great experience if you worked in full commission sales appliance and made all your goals.  I loved the fast paced sales environment. Due to the company currently turning belly up I had to find da new job even though I loved it.
good,"I sold electronics at Sears for three years.  It was a blast, hanging out, drinking, and getting high while getting paid for it was awesome.  But that was the nineties, I was young."
good,Sears has a decent automotive shop that i enjoyed working with a couple of occasions. Only real downfall is the drop in Auto Service resulted in the the company downsizing quite a bit which results in less work/commision opportunities.
good,so days are non-stop on the go working full 8 hrs. some days are very short maybe a max. of 4 hrs. working around the store was nice. get to lay out the floor plans and position things how you want it.
good,"Productive,enjoyable , lovable characters  dealing with a variety of accounts holders from the East Coast to the  West coast in various situations, helping to achieve a  manageable agreement for outstanding payments to the terms of  the allowable credits. "
good,You get no holidays off and must work black Friday.  Its retail. What do you expect.  Management is mediocre but once you learn the job its easy and fun with lots of pay potential
good,Management is constantly rotating which creates instability to the teams and the loss of very talented people that make the difference in the execution of initiatives. Growth opportunities are very limited due to the rough financial situation of the company.
good,Had some members of management that only focused on the bad everyday. Always what was done wrong never what was done right.
good,"As a sales associate you are paid hourly and paid on commission for products sold. Management varies, some are great and some are absent and hard to contact."
good,"Receive service calls on laptop, systems has some glitches but being worked out. Able to communicate with Routing for any assistance needed. Daily duties typical HVAC service, maintenance & Repairs. Co-workers communicate well."
good,"The hardest part of the job would be lack of resources and payroll. Very few associates working at a time, and since hours were cut Sears expects the same result with fewer people to get the job done"
good,"My experience here unfortunately was not a pleasant one. Retail in itself is a stressful job, however lack of proper scheduling is a constant problem."
good,This was my first real job that seem to be ok at the begin. its a ok paying job but to much hard work labor with to little pay. some how we are always short staff we never leave work on time because the csa are always trying to make a sale.  management doesn't make a schedule under Saturday.
good,"Managing an online medical business I gained some of the valuable skills like an open mind, a willingness to do whatever is needed, and a positive attitude which would be an asset to me."
good,"Developers are hired with no job security. Workplace is decent with good environment. The company is big, so there are things to do apart from just your job. Developers are hired without sufficient knowledge of how many are needed in the department."
good,"It was alright working there. Smooth and easy job. "
good,the only thing that kept me there was my co workers besides that it was a horrible job. You didn't get paid enough for what you did and the management was sexist.
good,"Working at Sears was nice, staff was respectful and they worked my school schedule. What i did not like was that i didn't receive a lot of hours."
good,"a good job, you work independently and everybody will help you with any query. the management is good but not quite efficient. the hardest part of the job is dealing with disrespectful customers. best part of the job is talking to respectful and understanding customers."
good,Just as life and society has become more numbers driven so has Sears. I truly understand competition and growth but it shouldn't be at the expense of ones values and principles. When I worked for this company the first 12 years it was so much fun although a great deal of work. It was my determining factor when I was offered an opportunity to return to the organization. I only hope the company and its Team the best. I would love to see the organization Return to its value that made it 1 of the #1 retailers in the market!!
good,"Nothing really to say about this.  You spend the majority of the time taking merchandise to the floor, unloading and reloading the trucks.  making sure the backroom is clean and orderly.  helping the customers with their larger purchases."
good,"es muy agotador, aprendi sobre las ventas y al trato con la gente, la gerencia muy bien y mis colegas muy buenos, hay mucho compañerismo y trabajo en equipo, la parte mas dificil es ordenar buscar mercancia y sobre todo cuando no hay ventas no ganas por que somos comisionados"
good,"pros: decent work hours"
good,"I love the family vibe I get from leadership"
good,"friendly atmosphere, poorly managed,good co workers,all aspects of running store operation,long hours no holidays,store is now closed"
good,Sears is a good starting point and you have the ability to advance quickly if you put forth the hard work. I learned many things in management in a very short period of time.
good,More cons then pros. Company needs to improve their procedures in every aspect. Techs made the middle man too often. I enjoy doing the work itself. But there is too much inbetween.
good,"Management is usually a joke considering most aspects of working in the backroom. Proper equipment is generally lacking (SNCs, fitting back belts, no forklift, etc). Backroom coworkers are all easy to get along with. We usually buy pizza as a group every friday after unloading the weekly freight."
good,"A typical day at Sears entails a few customers every so often, and a lot of pressure to take advantage of the few with credit opportunities. After learning to be personable and having little formal training, credit applications are driven above providing what would seem to be a pleasant experience in Sears. The other sales associates are very nice and easy to get along with, management on the other hand requires some getting used to (not necessarily a negative connotation). The most difficult part of working at Sears is standing for hours with little work to do but wait for one of a possibly a few people to check out. With so few customers coming into Sears the push to apply for credit is not proportional."
good,"I learned that sales was not just a job for me, but a passion. I enjoyed engaging customers and trying to help them find the best deal for the their needs."
good,"Some days working at sears were good, some were bad. I got along with my co-workers pretty well even thought some were difficult to work with. The management was ok but could be better. The best part of the job was engaging with customers and building a relationship with them."
good,This is a decent job for part-time work. You learn how to make cold sales. Those that can produce even in poor regions are given the opportunity to work trade shows. This is not a position to get rich in - but excellent for those wanting flexible part-time work.
good,On my second day of work I was put on a cash register by myself before I was even able to have enough training. Very friendly and helpful co-workers. Did not give me proper training
good,"The engineering work when not encumbered by the business teams and management is great. However, the lack of leadership and vision makes the future of the company uncertain"
good,"At the time that I left Sear's, I was a Loss Prevention Manager. A typical day was reviewing surveillance cameras for possible theft and managing the third party security officers that worked with my staff."
good,Working for this company allowed to learn and experience first hand about minor and major vehicle repairs. Expanding my mechanical knowledge of  vehicles gave me the edge I needed to be an excellent customer service associate in the industry.
good,"not much can be said about the sears where i worked at. it was in a large mall, the place was decently designed with multiple floors, and the customers were tolerable."
good,Manager is cool the only person you gotta look out for is the main boss who always wants to get people in trouble. good for someone who needs a job for the mean time
good,"Sears is an old well organized company with a many different type of employees from student to the elderly people. every day was a new experience for me, the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customer and management occasionally congrats me for the way I treated customers.I learned how to deal with customers and co-workers in a big group and learned how can I be a team player."
good,"Greatly enjoyed my co-workers. Some of the best people to work with and great team players. Unfortunately,Some Management are bullies and abuse their position.   Sadly, the business is not doing very well and have cut down on hours causing many of us to find employment elsewhere."
good,"I work at a pretty small workplace with 4 other employees including my manager. Dealing with people directly while representing a large company, one thing I have learned is how to interact with others in a way to bring about positive outcomes.  I deal with customers with a range of issues regarding my company and instructions must be followed, while ensuring my customer is as pleased as possible with the outcome. This trait allows me to assist customers and work with my team in a way to move my part of this company forward."
good,"a very active job,keeps you going all day long making sure we keep the store clean and well mantained. interact with both costumers and employees."
good,Terrible management all around. No help and got nothing but sarcasm and negative comments. The other staff was the only reason any other employee stayed there. Would never tell anyone to work for Sears.
good,"Typical day at work is dealing with rude customers saying things about how expensive things are, I learned that the warranties at Sears are pretty great. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful especially during my first day in the job, but the newest manager they have talks down to employees and although means well is extremely rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was both the ratchet repairs and getting people to get a protection agreement both for the commission and for the enjoyment of helping someone protect their investment. The hardest part of the job was the way customers were allowed to walk all over you and the horrible hours."
good,"Since I started no one was really happy their. Someone was always complaining. Management is horrible. Managers ignore employees and customers. The Back Room team doesn't get paid enough or credit for anything. They just complain about the Back room team. Your store cannot function with out the back room and no one has respect for them. They can't even rest because they are running the store, and the one I worked at you were pretty much alone most of the time. That doesn't make sense. It is a two man job at least. I say 3 people should always be on there. Two would be fine, but there is only one when the other person takes lunch."
good,"je ne me rappel pas trop mais je sais que c`était bien."
good,"compagnie tout indiquée pour les généralistes du commerce aux détails (multi tâches)"
good,"Overall, it is an okay job. Fun job but not enough to support yourself in life money wise. If you are not a manager it is hard to live off of working here."
good,"mejoramiento del sueldo base y mejores comisiones, creación de estrategias e ideas para evitar la competitividad equivoca con los internos."
good,"Typical Day Is Slow Except For Holidays"
good,"As a member of the Sears team I enjoyed my jobs.  However it there was no growth for any positions beyond mine.  The company is going through a lot of store closing nation wide.  "
good,"Setting up work orders for customers, warrntys for appliances, leads help out all the time, co-workers help sometimes, taking high intake of calls in a short about of time. Helping customers."
good,I usually worked three times a day for four hours. It is a great place to work. You are always busy doing something and the people did their job. The manger was mean but very serious about her job. They always wrote everything down for me about whats going on and if we had a meeting they would always get an interpreter.
good,"Great people to work with, however Sr. management is distant and not enough is being done to reduce costs is the most obvious ways."
good,I would feel good about repairing other peoples automobiles on a daily bases. The management was very helpful and constructive in their guidance. I learned a lot about a lot of different automobile.
good,I enjoyed being able to help and assist customers with their needs. Being trusted to do transactions for several thousand dollars or more safely and securely. The hardest part of the job was not always having what the customer needed in the store for them.
good,"Estar presente en una auditoria no es fácil ya que la responsabilidad de que la empresa se encuentre en optimas condiciones no es solo responsabilidad del personal o del alto mando sino que es una responsabilidad de un buen trabajo en equipo y es algo que casi no se ve, ya que la empresa paga por comisión y todos compiten entre si."
good,I enjoyed working with the many associates I met at Sears. There was always something to do which kept the workday productive. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them find the merchandise they wanted.
good,The out of date computers and systems made the job longer and harder than I thought it would be. The process for checking people out and getting them a credit card was long and drawn out as well.
good,"A typical day at Sears Canada is short-lived. I worked on the merchandising team and typically most of the staff is part-timers as Sears Canada is moving away from full-time status positions as it is cheaper to hire several part-timers versus full-timers. You would typically be only scheduled during truck days and a day prior to advertisement set-up (changing signs in the store to reflect next day sales). Usually you get anywhere from 1-8 skids daily with merchandise that needs to be stocked. There is usually 1 individual in each department stocking product whereas 2 in larger departments like men's or women's fashions. There is quite a lot of pressure on you to finish quickly in short 4-6 hour shifts as it is rare getting a full shift during the day."
good,"Little room for advancement, poor management, and unreliable hours. The workers were great and really friendly though."
good,"Really enjoyed job, co workers"
good,"Great work life balance, interesting projects, lots of cool stuff happening all around the company in terms of projects and fun activities."
good,"The job in itself is easy, but management will make you do other things and train you to do other peoples jobs with no hope of advancing or getting a raise.  It sucks to be a hard worker because you take on all the work and responsibility and get paid the same as the lazy or incompetent coworkers."
good,"A typical day at Sears would be to clock in and go to your department. star folding and organizing areas where its most needed. assisting cashiers if needed and checking the fitting rooms. At Sears I learned how to handle responsibilities, because sometimes we would have a lot of work and we had to find a way to take on those responsibilities at a short time. The management their was okay. Some managers were really mean and not helpful at all. The co-workers were also okay they would do their job. The hardest part was on black Friday a lot of people show up and the work is non stop. The most enjoyable part of the job was being cashier i loved doing that."
good,"Sears had a vibrant and outgoing staff. The workload, although sometimes hectic, was never unbearable."
good,Sears was a great place to work at and get hands on everything I learned alot in the 4 years i worked their. Unfortunately they went through alot of managers and on top of that my pay was not making sense i was doing work without getting my raised i was promised.
good,"I learned a lot from Sears. I learned how to deal with different people,how to maintain relationships with co-workers by helping them,was fun to work with my co-workers. My management was so good and supporting. "
good,"Le personnel est très aimable et sociable. Malheureusement il n'y a pas d'augmentation de salaire, peu importe l'expérience et la productivité."
good,"Enjoyed the people that I trained and the team I had, fulfilling to help people succeed, wear many hats. Very busy office, never a dull moment always work to do. Very overwhelming at times."
good,I would ring up customers and help them locate the product that they were looking for. I would also put Lawn& Garden product into service if they were under warranty and needed to be repaired
good,"Sears was OK to work for. I was technically part-time, but pushed about 33-36 hours a week working at minimum wage doing customer service. The largest benefit was that I had a manageable work/life balance, and the work was stead for a time. "
good,"Very fast pace, detailed and structured work place.  Unlimited amount of resources and room to grow.  Staff and management very friendly and helpful."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at SHC, however, it's really hard to accomplish change because there are so many hoops you have to jump through. The company has failed to change and thus has struggled for years. I wouldn't recommend working here strictly due to job security reasons. SHC could go under at any time."
good,Management. Its not what it used to be. I was told that Sears in itself is not what it used to be. Management couldn't work with me. And they didn't see my hard work.
good,The job was straight forward and most times enjoyable.   The company as a whole is not competitive in today's retail environment.
good,"Before I begin my review, I worked for a franchised location. I'm assuming my review will not fit the bill for many Sears locations. "
good,Typical day varies. Most of the coworkers are nice. The hardest part of the job is getting credit apps. The best part of the job is getting to leave.
good,work place is unorganized and management is not great with helping boost employee moral . staff often played against each other by management.
good,The co-workers are friendly and the management is helpful. The counter is not very busy so it gets rather boring at times. The employees take yearly online test to improve customer service.
good,I enjoy having a good Salary but as a manager I have to put in 60+ hours a week 24 hours straight on thanksgiving. I would like to have a better work/life balance.
good,I took inbound calls then I was selected to moved to outbound calls. learned how to processed credit cards on a virtual cash register. I learned management was not consistence. I treated everyone that I came in contact with in person or on the phone the way I wanted to be treated. The hardest part of the job was management picking and choosing when they wanted to apply the rules. Interacting with my co-workers and speaking with different customer's from all over the world
good,pool table on the floor for recreational breaks. some compensations for some departments. fun and friendly people. the work floe is somewhat slow but the people around me make it a lot of fun. we take care of major order related issues. delivery/installation of major appliances and coordinating dates for said services on the daily basis. the hardest part of my job is putting up with upset customers that tend to go overboard and yell and curse at me out of frustration.
good,"My experience as a sears tools associate is as expected. it is not for someone to try and live off of. i am 20 years old andi have to pay my own bills, well on 9.47 an hour and 20 hours a week you cant pay for much. there is practically no benefits and you cant advance at all just transfer to a different department. the only thing it has going for it is that the management team is awesome. they are understanding and are willing to work with you if you have an issue."
good,"Management was not very friendly or understanding, did not really like working there. I loved working with all coworkers, but when it came to management, they were not very understanding when it came to me and working being 8 month pregnant. Took awhile to get a stool to sit on when I gave them a doctor's note; had me work 14 plus hour shift on Black Friday when I was 9 months pregnant."
good,"I loved my job, but the management is just horrible. They complain about everything and want everything done. which is impossible when they push you back more and more."
good,It was a terrible place to work and even if the management wanted to there was little to nothing they could do without cooperate blaming something else on us.
good,"Nothing really special, I would receive a pile of books once a month to deliver house to house, nothing really crazy. I didnt really know any of the workers and never actually sawthe van that would drop the books at my house."
good,"BUSY"
good,A typical work day involves engagement with advisors and peers to assist with escalated members with complex retail related issues.
good,Able to meet and greet different people everyday. Job was not hard to do. Co- worker were friendly and work as a team. I learned how to deal with different personalities and attitudes.
good,"Working with the employees at Sears was great, I applied for many jobs to move up in the company and I never got interviewed for any of them. They don't like to give raises or let any one move up in the company, they hire from the outside."
good,"A typical day involved greeting customers, answering questions, making and closing sales, as well as keeping my department clean and organized. During my time I learned the importance of developing leads as well as maintaining them. The most enjoyable part of my job was closing the sale."
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in,checking status of orders,putting out items from safe,stocking if we have any items to stock,general duties and running register. "
good,"This was a nice company to be apart of, i learned a lot of new skills in which I can apply to future jobs I will have. I also had very nice managers that were always there to help if needed."
good,"Always fast paced but was rarely slow, management could have been better, enjoyed the co-workers, and learned a lot more."
good,Walking through the store and speaking with the members you realize something about what the store is doing is driving off it's customers and they are not able to attract new ones.
good,"I currently work at sears, my store is very laid back. People i work with are ok, very gossipy with a bit of drama though, so i tend not to associate with that. Pay isnt the best, im a cashier and start at 9 an hour, but with an extra 2 bucks for every credit app that i process. Management is super bipolar lol, if your not doing well with sales and credits they nit pick, if you do well then your like an angel to them. Very good first job. Definitely not something you want to make a career out of thats for sure."
good,Management is great and everyone is extremely supportive. Job is exciting and fun when the store is busy. Unfortunately the store does not stay busy except for a couple times per week and to fill this gap in time resetting and cleaning the department is the only additional work to be done. This is a great entry level sales position for anyone that wants to get a solid opportunity in face to face sales.
good,They did not care about their employees only the metrics. As many years as I have worked there I have seen Sears start to treat customers with no respect and always passed the buck. I would not recommend employment to anyone to work there.
good,"the only thing good about this company is that the commission rate was good, but the management was very misleading. the company is going down the drain, so they will hire you in a heartbeat and also would get rid of you in a blink of an aye"
good,"Being an MCA is not exactly easy and you probably do more physical work than cashiers and other sales associates. It's a big store, so you will be doing a lot of walking around-you better have comfortable shoes.  Sure, when you are new it is OK, but once you have been there awhile, your responsibilities will increase and they will make you do more.  MCA's typically clean out fitting rooms, put the ad up (sales signs), do price checks, do mark downs and put merchandise out on the floor. "
good,This was my first job and how lucky i was to be made a sales manager. At Sears you will do a lot of different things giving you well rounded work experience. However pay was frequently late or not paid at all at one point i went 5 weeks without pay of any kind.
good,I enjoyed working at Sears. But only thing that I was not getting working hours which could fulfill my requirements. Staff was very helping hand.
good,"Driving to member's home at scheduled at a preset determined time and conducting a full in-home product presentation to the member, utilizing the complete Ten Step Selling Plan, bringing the showroom to the member, and giving a total price guarantee on-site.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting members with updating their kitchen and bathroom, seeing all sorts of different homes and getting to know all sort of different people.  All of the Sears employees are like a family and are eager to help each other out day or night."
good,Good place to work if your going to school or a collage.  Noticed for some people it is hard to advance in the company.  Great co workers but not enough hours or advancement in pay.  Used to be a good company till K mart bought it.
good,"Great communication between management and staff."
good,"Task driven, customer service focus, team environment at all levels, long hours to contribute for covering store needs, the people lots of great associates and customers. Keeping business on track."
good,"Company changes tactics and direction every 6 months;striving to determine how to increase profitability. Lacking sales and continued profit loss has created a desperate culture within upper management. Customer service is stressed. Store level try very hard to satisfy all customers. Lack of follow-up, team work, and accountability of service and delivery teams make it extremely difficult to give great satisfaction and attain commitments for customers."
good,"My typical day requires a review of the following day’s statistics. I review our department numbers, my individual team’s numbers and all other sites performance. This requires attendance, revenue, commission and overall performance. I have learned how to manage hourly agents, salaried managers and how to make a profit for the company. My co-workers and I manage different parts of our business. We work together to form well in order to exist. I learn their departments and adapt to the different styles. The best part of my job is being able to communicate with so many different people and personalities. Everyone I work with knows something I do not. My job is to find out what it is and use it. The most difficult part of my job is the never ending sales. In the sales world, today's goals are tomorrow’s minimum standards."
good,"fast paced environment, flexible schedule, enjoy working with other associates. learned a lot about customer service and sales."
good,"Cashiering, organizing, cleaning, stocking, pricing."
good,It's a hard job lots of lifting the pay is comission only with a very low milage amount. The leads are very spotty with most people shopping
good,"A typical work day for me would start off with me opening my registers, and counting the money in the drawers. Then when the store opens I would check customers out. Management would come by every few hours to ask what the percentage was on the computer and also ask if I had got any credit applications.my co-workers were very nice to work with they all worked hard to make their goals in credit applications .The hardest part of my job was not being able to make my credit goals every day. The best part of my job that I most enjoyed was the interaction with customers."
good,"Good people, tough job, but enjoyed. Had never worked in sales so was different than the regular lab work. Learn a lot about sales."
good,Kmart allows for its employees to help brighten customers day. I enjoy working here but I need more hours to pay for my school tuition.
good,"A typical day at the call center consisted of yelling and arguing with customers. Making customers go weeks without working appliances. Wheather it's their fault or not. Whenever a customer would ask for a supervisor you basically have to argue with them until they hung up or realize they'll never get one. And if you ever did make a supervisor actually talk to a customer be prepared to get a ""coaching"" of what you should have said along with a nasty stare and eye rolling. Not all supervisors were bad though mine was excellent the others were terrible. I mean why be a supervisor and not want to handle escalated calls.  O and to top it off there's no annual raise for being a technical specialist. Of you want to get paid more then you have to sale more but be prepared to be stuck at $11 a hr. Good starting pay for a young adult with no family."
good,Great interaction with problem solving and customer relations. Saying yes to customer is a plus. No further room for advancement. Looking to change my career. Hardest part of the job is the tug of war that happens between SHOS the Franchise owner and Sears corporate. Most enjoyable part is the constant flow of customer doing what I do best.
good,"Sears has many good elements that make them the prime example of great department store. Though much of Sears has lost its luster that gave them great prestige in their golden years. Management is somewhat unresponsive. Where they only notice when something bad happens and also seems to only be looking out for them selves. Employee morale is very low, though it doesn't stop them from performing to the best of their abilities. On an employee perspective, Sears is a job only suited for a short-term basis."
good,"typical day at work was ringing up costumers, at work i learned to better my costumer service skills. The management was fair, my co-workers were nice some friendly. most enjoyable part about working at sears were meeting the costumers"
good,"I believe if the managements can communicate with all the co-workers  the company will much better. Hoping everything will overseas the every employee, they should prioritize in times of giving hours to the old employee ."
good,"Overall, a good first time, and you're able to learn a lot of customer experience and general folding habits. You know how to adjust your time management skills to better accommodate what's more important"
good,"I answered the phone setting up appointments for their appliances to be delivered, called those that their merchandise was delayed, trained a lot of people"
good,"Despite how difficult it was to work at Sears I am glad I met such great people."
good,A normal day at work consisted of me talking to customers about products and making sure everything in my department was running smoothly. I learned how to sell to many different people and also the ability to explain a variety of products.
good,"I worked in the shoe department, helped people with online orders, and etc. I learned how to stock freight, etc. Management was awesome, always willing to help."
good,"If your not a minor they give you ridiculous hours for only minimum wage. Although there is a chance to get commission (which they basically force you to get) it's not much, and because your paid bi-weekly your broke by the end of the week. God forbid you have to pay any bills because you wont have any choice but to get a second job which most associates do. And just try to leave, it's nearly impossible to even transfer if you happen to move. So all in all, good for minors with no responsibilities, not so good for anyone else."
good,"Sears is not a good place to work, there's a bad vibe while walking into work. I can't speak for Sears Holding Company overall but for the specific place I worked, it was terrible. Management was also unorganized."
good,"Working in consultative sales it was my job to assist customers in the hardlines department. This department was everything that wasn't large appliances or clothing. My routine was comprised of opening and closing duties with registers, cleaning and stocking the aisles, operating point of sale systems, and learning the about the product line of sears and craftsman utility items. I became fluent in understanding functions of various tools for many “trade” jobs and projects, there was a great variety of customers that came into the store looking for something specific and it was my job to help them. It was common to multitask several detail oriented projects at once, on line orders and telephone calls would be separated between checking the warehouse stock on an item, or explaining specs on tractors, air compressors or chainsaws. This pace was fine, and I liked being able to have control of the tasks I could see through. Building customer relationships was a big part of this job since I had the potential to make a small commission off of an extended warranty we were urged to upsell as a mandatory part of the job. The commission was equivalent to one percent of sales after sales goals were met for the day."
good,"cashed the public out"
good,"The management wasn't great, we switched managers a few times in only a couple of months. You do not get paid enough to deal with the rude customers that come in because Sears made a mistake,  not me."
good,the first couple of months where good i loved the enviroment and my fellow co works welcomed me with open arms i loved it but my last couple of months there i had problems with my manager in my department she wanted to cut my hours because of me talking to other co workers which i thin is against the law but from tht point on i did my job and finally decided to quit because of her
good,"Not a bad job. Decent compensation plan. Management could use a lot of work, company is falling apart. Great co workers. Very decent hours."
good,"Very poor management, unprofessional environment, unionized unit so everything is based on seniority, nothing is based on merrit. Good job security due to union"
good,I learned how to efficiently manage the stockroom and store layout as well as using the tracking system which was administered to us in terms of our receiving manager.
good,Worked as a salesmen.  On a slow day you would barely sell anything.  The work life balance was pretty good. Sundays would get out early.
good,"Not a bad place to work, however there are a few things company-wise that make this not the BEST place to work. Its almost as if this place is a walking contradiction, ""do this but dont do this, you can do that but cant do that"" its confusing. Management plays favorites when it comes to vto, offline time, dress code violations, attendance , etc. The only reason im still here is because MY manager is one of the kindest and most helpful in the en tire call center and my team is close knit. Otherwise, management could really give 2 effs about the employees. "
good,"the overall was fine.and I received numerous accolades from the job .also i love working with people.the company contract all the work out to us,so we had to pay for everything."
good,"Handle sales transactions, which may include operating cash registers; explain cash back reward policies/store promotions."
good,"There aren't many customers on a regular basis, but sometimes they can come in huge waves, so high customer volume times are rare. The store is always neat and clean and managers seems to make sure of it, as well as praise you for your good work. Compensation could be better, but the store doesn't make enough money to allow that. Co-workers are all friendly and hard-working and help when you need it. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to find an associate to cover for you while you go on break since there aren't too many associates. The most enjoyable part of the job would most likely be being able to help people find what they need, because they leave satisfied."
good,"I have worked in two different departments with this company since I began working there over a year ago. When I worked as a Softlines Merchandise Customer Associate, I mostly walked around the store and straightened up any areas that were not neat and tidy. I then helped to keep the dressing rooms empty of clothing. I also occasionally covered for any cashiers that needed to take their lunch breaks. My co-workers were not always engaged in their job and would talk to one another frequently."
good,I have grown in the Sears environment in the leadership and areas of Multi unit management . Great company to get your start
good,Constantly changing job requirements and schedule.  Management feedback was not very consistent. There is an enormous effort of the part of management to show employees they were valued.
good,"Good people, but cloudy outlook makes it a difficult place to come to work everyday."
good,"surveillance des employes"
good,. company was a lot of fun to work for 13 years ago.  recent years have seen the economy destroy the companies bottom line so there has been a mass exodus amongst top management positions.  most notably the president and vice president of the home improvement division.
good,"A typical day would be buffing & waxing floors, cleaning windows, and taking care of all handy needs. The day would start super early because we have to have the store spotless before it opens. It takes a hard working person to do this job. Time & patience is everything. This was a job I didn't want to do as a man but I had to do what it took to be a man."
good,I enjoyed working for Sears and I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I was easily trained to perform the duties that were needed.
good,"This is great place to work if want some additional  income ,,but not as primary job.   Loved the discount. Had to work with a lot kids who did not want work."
good,Key skills in my position starts at associates. Positive and happy team members make a winning team. Having a daily focus and or goals contributes to success if all members are involved.The hardest part of any job is dealing and adjusting to the daily climate of customers and associates( internal and external).  Shifting on the fly to adjust to the task at hand and still achieve the expected goals and or projects.The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing people grow and succeed to the next level. In turn this is a positive for both the associate and the company.
good,"I start at Sears, department of hardware and I know a lot of tools, but because I was very good seller, the manager of the department changed my department appliances where achieves also highlight and make good weekly sales."
good,"lots of pressure and confusion, but i can say i learned alot of skills coworkers are cool. customers can be very challenging."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking out the trash, checking lists for delivery, pricing, and customer service. What I learned at Sears Outlet in Elgin is their management isn't all that great and they intimidate their employees with aggression. My co-workers seemed okay. The hardest part of the job was working with management and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with customers and taking care of their needs."
good,Not a bad place to work for someone who is willing to work seven days a week. You can make a lot of money but you must be willing to sacrifice a lot.
good,"es una empresa muy competitiva a nivel comercio en el cual yo estuve 4 años."
good,"Learnt a lot of thing thing here. colleagues are suportive. Support thing was really bad, developers have to support application as well. No monitory compensation for support work."
good,"Llegada, entrada, saludos,novedades y a la chamba, luego la comida sin contratiempos ni prisas."
good,Sears is going down hill fast.   They are having a hard time finding good employees.   Existing staff must cover for employee shortages at other stores.   Products sold by sears show signs of inferior workmanship.
good,"A typical day begins with price changes and moves on to resets, customer issues, inventory changes, and setting ads.  I gained a lot of people skills at Sears along with rudementary knowledge of management."
good,"I enjoy the responsibilities I have at the position, and I enjoy working with the public.  My co-workers are great, and overall it is a good company.  The reason for looking for additional employment is the weekly hours available to work are very limited."
good,"Daily counting of safe."
good,"At Sears, we are put in different departments depending on where they need associates. We work the cash, make sure the merchandise is clean and help customers. "
good,"If you are among the chosen few, you can have a good career here. That is, as long as Sears Holdings can keep it's head above water. Some people come in and rise to the top because they are given opportunities. Others stay where they are because they do the day-to-day work that keeps the place going."
good,I have worked there for over 7 years and through out the years sears has been a great place to work. They work well with your schedule and understand your family needs. but lately the management has gone down hill. Metrics are more important then your well being and has become a very stressful place to work. Customers are last on the list to be taken care of regardless of the management saying they are number one. The management team spend more time in the office then out help the employees who are often found in front of angry customers.
good,i worked outside in public where the work was. you stoped too get coffee or a coke if needed and brought or bought your lunch.very seldom finished early if so you went back too the dept too do something
good,My day consists of both inbound & outbound calls with customers regarding repairs.Management is fine-the issues are bigger than management. The company seems to be in trouble.There is not much opportunity for advancement at this point.
good,"Sears has the highest paid appliance sales associates, which is always nice. As long as you stay aggressive on the floor, you will make good money. However, day-to-day is dull and tedious, and as the company is currently struggling, business is not as good as it used to be."
good,staff is great. customers are fun to serve. pay was minimum wage I feel for the amount of work the compensation could of been a little bit more.
good,"There's not really any opportunities for advancement unless you go into sales. If you do a good job, others get recognized for it. I enjoy selling mattresses and learning new things in every department, but the cons far out weigh the benefits. My co-workers make work worth while, they really are the best. Management is a little touch and go, some are really great and will have your back when things go wrong, and others you have to tip toe around."
good,It's not a fun place to work. People are not friendly or helpful.
good,"Its a typical job with the typical stresses and environment. There's difficult people and there's bearable people. The pay and benefits could be better. I worked at the Sears Auto Center btw, not the main store. In my store in particular, heads clash on an almost daily basis due to the strong and opinionated personalities of some coworkers and the managers, so there's usually an argument going on and sometimes customers witness it and its kinda unprofessional."
good,"Sears is an okay place, I wouldn't ever work there again though. I feel like it will go out of business soon anyways but who knows. Very Droll place to work. But if you have no better options then definitely head on over there. The management is really lacking though"
good,"I learned how to perform vehicle alignments, most co workers were great"
good,Typical day at work is helping customers loading/unloading trucks. I learned a lot the best was learning all the paper work. Management was ok. The hardiest part was lifting appliance by myself. The best part at work was helping customers
good,"Working at Sears Logistics Incorporated was a grueling workplace that dealt with constant removing of unloading and loading of warehousing materials.  I learned most of my skills here for about 7 years.  The management team were fine, but they had some flaws in their production instructions.  Finally, working there was a huge help to myself working as a warehousing associate."
good,"It's a cashier job, what else can I say. Management is ok, co-workers are nice. There is no promotions or any way of advancement so I would only recommend this job for a first job. Getting credits is a really pushed for the cashiers to get. If your numbers are not good they will let you go."
good,Many Sears are closing. Mainly the stores but the auto shops are closing as well. They're all about numbers and not about personality.
good,"Management is great at my location, can not really complain about who I work with. But as a company I do not think that they truly appreciate the employees that work for them. The systems for sears are not the most reliable."
good,"good co-workers and management, the only bad about this company is the yearly review, no extra money.."
good,"It is a easy job which is probably why i get such a low payment, but whatever it takes to get an income i guess. The hardest part of the job is probably unloading the truck which is really easy. The co-workers are really nice. I would prefer a better paying job which keeps you busy."
good,"serving customers, upselling products"
good,"I worked an average of 13 hours per day managing a crew of 30 technicians on productivity, sales, and service.  The job was an up hill battle, due to upper level management's greediness at making money, at the expense of overworking the majority of employees.  Most technicians were made to work over 60 hour weeks forcing fatigue, poor moral, and unsafe working conditions.  I enjoyed my position as a leader but my hands were tied when I tried to fight for my crew for fair treatment and reasonable working conditions."
good,"I love being able to review my assortments, identify those under performing and look for replacements.  Meet with vendors to see what is new and exciting and work to place these items within my current assortments to make them that much more productive."
good,"Everyday you come into work you have to clock in at one of the computer that we have, put on your name tag, and get prepared to start your day. As a sales associate you have to ring everything you sell on an iPad. Everyday you have to check one out under your name and take it back to be scanned back in."
good,"Coworkers were helpful, but management struggled. Very high turn around rate. The hardest part of the job was miscommunication between the managers."
good,"-Counting your register before and after shift, assisting customers, cleaning area and department, setting up displays."
good,Working at Sears is indeed work.....few employees in various departments. Often times customers have to wait extended times with some customers walking out. Positive: Fantastic Manager who works along side us and backs us up 100% Have worked 3 yrs Part time with the promise of being made full time. Still part time.
good,"Company isn't stable, and looking for a job that is secure. Cuts keep coming, and the work load doesn't get any lighter."
good,I haven't worked for this company for so long that to review it would not give an accurate portrait of the current company environment.
good,Sears does not pay well in relation to the amount and different kinds of tasks required for this job. The last pay raise I had there was four cents.
good,"Unless you were in another part of the store, its hard to make a living."
good,It was great to work with sears and learned the management field.
good,"Everything was pretty good except for the work hours, and they don't really allow too much leniency for any slip ups or emergencies."
good,The job isn't bad but the pay structure can be difficult. The base pay is only 6 an hour and it is possible to owe the company if you don't make enough commission. some of the worst benefits I have ever seen offered.
good,"Other than the experience, employees are well under paid. Company wants you to trick people in getting credit cards Hard to move up in the company."
good,"Its a good place to gain entry level customer service, shift hrs can be assigned better, some gets 40 hrs some get 35-40hrs a week."
good,"Great place to work in the beginning & then the company went down hill. No raises, poor management skills, little room for growth & very unorganized. Employees were friendly. Hardest part of the job was dealing w/ management, not the customers."
good,"Sears was interesting for a couple of reasons. 1. The management was strict. 2. The employees were relaxed and enjoyed working there. and 3. The mix of both 1 and 2 created problems that could only be solved by either promoting or firing an employee. "
good,The work that was performed was security for Sears Roebuck. This job had it's ups and downs. This job required walking around the store and assuring customers safety as well as employees. The hardest part of this job and sometimes dangerous when someone is shoplifting in the store and we had to follow them around till they dropped it. I like talking to customers and employees and letting them know that I was here to help.
good,This was a nice place to work very hery hectic though. Negotiating with clients to pay their bills was sad at times
good,"My typical day is walking all over Sears talking to people to set appointments for home improvement consultations. "
good,"I typical day is to provide the best service possible while meeting all needs and wants of the customer."
good,Enjoy the job but poor management but company will not be around for long.co-workers great . Hardest part of job is staying excited to go to work.
good,"A typical day at work during the week may be slow unless there is a sale going on. I learned people skills and definately communication skills. Management is a little crazy because there is always someone new, especially store managers. The co-workers are the best thing about the job. Almost everyone gets along and can relate to each other. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes it can get pretty boring and that you don't get paid enough or get raises. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the co-workers."
good,I enjoy being able to help customers during their home remodeling experience to make it as smooth as possible.
good,"Sears/Kmart is a great place to start for young adults and people looking for a career change.  Starting salaries are pretty competitive and you will gain a lot of experience.  However, this is where it stops.  Once you are employed you will receive little to no raises (unless promoted), high cost medical benefits, and an unorganized management workforce that have colliding agendas.  Sears is structured in silos with senior execs and boards each running their own divisions with no conformity among the big picture.  Crumbling stores that are continuously closing without any improvements and a reclusive CEO who is selling all the parts to attempt to stop the bleeding."
good,"good people, okay company, needs major updates in the stores."
good,Les gens avec qui je travaille sont tous sympathiques et il est agréable de travailler avec eux.
good,Although it is a family like environment not all members of management take their jobs seriously. I would not recommend the company to anyone looking for a career.
good,"I enjoy what I do quite a bit, however, when I put the enjoyment I get in my work in a balance with the benefits the company provides, the opportunity for advancement and the long-term outlook of the company, I feel that I need to look elsewhere."
good,it was good for part time not reliable that much but its okay.
good,"Very fast pace working job, all about customer service and working with sales personal"
good,A typical day would be assisting customers with their purchases and suggestive selling
good,I was afforded the pleasure of working independently with the trust of my supervisor.
good,"Sears Auto Center is not a bad job if you're looking for part time employment, or a teenager looking for some easy money. The job was enjoyable, but just not the kind of job you have to raise a family."
good,"There are many a dead time spaces where you can either fold towels or help hang up new merchandise but when behind a register, be quick the after 5 crowd builds momentum quickly and lines become unbearable"
good,"When they switched managers to surrounding locations, this store died in many ways. There was a server cut in hours even for associates that had been there for YEARS!"
good,Sears was a nice place to work. Kind of working at a plant. It was cool learning all the different cars and the specialty needed to properly complete the job.
good,"Working at any high volume call center can sometimes become overwhelming, but with the training I was well prepared."
good,I was a contract worker for Sears as a call center rep. I helped people that ordered online and helped them with any concerns.
good,"I owned the company"
good,"Sears was a great seasonal job, I learned a lot of customer service skills, sales, and retail that i took going forward in other employment ventures."
good,it was tough being a cashier during the holiday seasons but it was work and i needed it
good,"long hours , fun at work, work with your schedule, perfect if you are in school"
good,"good retail job."
good,The mangers along with the workers are very messy an drama filled
good,The managers are good about working with your schedule and there is little drama in the store among coworkers.
good,The job was very nice while I was raising a young family. It enabled me to work around their schedules from infant through school age. As I became the sole provider for my family I needed to seek full time employment and a better wage.  I loved the job and enjoyed the people I worked with during the time I was employed there.
good,"The only thing I loved about working at Sears was the people that worked there. Other than that, the managers would nag you about getting credit ALL THE TIME. If you didn't get enough credit they would make you go to a meeting on how to improve your work. The customers in my store were rude most of the time. I would work really hard and the managers would bicker on how I could improve, even though I'm a full time student. I work really hard even with the low pay."
good,"I enjoyed working in the optical area, learned a lot and liked the people I worked with and the people I helped when I could."
good,"Busy place to work, fast paced, a lot going on"
good,"this was a summer job just so I could stay busy, I liked the job but I needed to finish schooling."
good,it was interesting and great place to work .................
good,"I enjoy working at Sears in my department, however, the pay is TERRIBLE . They don't pay us enough for what all we do ."
good,work on multiple cars in need of service in a fast paced environment
good,"A good job for students looking to just pay the bills and make ends meet. Your typical department store culture, your coworkers and customers come from all walks of life, so there isn't a very specific description of day to day work."
good,"The people are pleasant to work with however, balancing my life ouside Sears is difficult when my wife works as well and you are required to work every weekend."
good,Typical call center work environment. Sign into phones and computers and took calls. Everyone kept to themselves and focused on their own calls. Had an open door policy and held team meetings. Managers over looked teams and assisted with any issues.
good,"Sears was a good place to work, I loved the job itself and the pay compensation and benefits were good as well.  "
good,"The location I worked at was at a dying shopping center, so things were usually very slow. Wouldn't be a bad student or supplemental income job though as it is usually low stress. Management will be on you constantly to process credit applications, though (which is a lot easier said than done). They do have a small cash incentive for each application you process however, which can help some. A lot of their styles are dated so this is not for the hot-and-hip to shop. Overall not a bad company, but you could probably do better."
good,"There's no pay raise (hasn't been for 5 years), growing with the company is pretty easy.. Don't expect nothing more than a Team Manager position. They try to make it a fun environment but what the workers really want is a pay raise.. at least $.25 cents every 6 months. But NOTHING Micromanagement at it's best. HIGH turn over rate.. I've been here a year they come and go. Honestly for Sears to be a major corporation I expected a lot more organization. You hired in working one area then by your 5th or 6th month you're working 3 area such as Lawn and Garden, Laundry and Kitchen and TSS (which is TV's, Garage door openers, and smart Washers, Dryers, and Refrigerators) you'll have to take on a load of stress on top of meeting metrics with NO PAY RAISE! It's a joke really."
good,"Le travail d'équipe est tres important pour moi. L'implication de chaque personnes fait en sorte que l'on atteint nos objectifs de compagnie .Prêcher par l'exemple pour une directrice est ce qui rend son équipe plus performante et productive étant donné que nous mettons le standard plus haut.Coachez,récompensez et encouragez son équipe font parti intégrante d'une journée au travail car après tout il faut quand même avoir du plaisir tout en travaillant."
good,"Lot's of overtime required, low pay for type of work performed."
good,It was stressful at times because we was short handed a lot. So it was common to do more than one persons job. Than there was times  I didnt have hours to come and make a pay check. it was insane.
good,"Selling, Selling, Selling. Sell the product-Sell credit-Sell protection. "
good,I've had a lot of fun the past three and a half years at sears Automotive. I've met a lot of great people.
good,"I've worked for the seasonal and stayed for the part time. The hours suck! You have to MAKE people sign up for a sears credit card! And if you don't, you're replaced with someone who can. It wasn't in my job description to shove that stuff down someone's throat!"
good,you install cameras and search for shoplifters and for internal theft
good,"Other than that, it's a pretty so-so place to work."
good,I have worked here for 20 years and have found my true passion as a District Loss Prevention Manager.
good,"My personal experience with Sears as an assoiciate is one of mixed reviews.My department manager is one who shows gratitude for the high acomplishments that I achieve for myself and for the store, but I disagree with the direction the company is heading and the direction the upper management is leading the store. The store seems to lack morale due to the lack of accreditation or acknowledgement from upper management, in corporate roles, for the hard work and success by myself and fellow associates. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the happiness in my customers faces when they recognize ho i have gone above and beyond to find the perfect purchase for them and have given them all the information possible to enhance their purchase further. The hardest part of my job is the lack of voice we have as employees towards how to benefit the store. Upper management has their idea of a culture it would like to fully instate, but never have I been approached and asked how I as a valued associate, can advise the team in what works and what does not. Most of all on what needs to change. My ideas are taken under advisement by my department manager and often implemented, but rarely taken under advisement by company leads because of lack of interest in those who truly make the company work."
good,"The hours are flexible at Sears, whether you are full time or part time. If you wish to work only mornings, only evenings, or only daytimes, that is possible. Help is usually around if you need it, and the other associates are very friendly. Customers are a big hassle as many of Sears' policies are very oddly worded and are hard to explain. Management changes hands quite often but for the most part is quite intelligent, friendly and helpful. Do not expect any raises or recognition for your work- just be another cog in the wheel. "
good,"there is no short day, the one good thing about sears is that you will be busy for when you get there till you have to leave, some days are better than others. But the co-workers there are very friendly there. so days helping the customers are the best part of the day but not all customers are friendly some just want to be in and out. the only part i did not like was they don't give you a raise because you do a lot of work but no raise will be giving to you"
good,"I work in the stock room.  I manage the stock locations to ensure all places have the right amount of merchandise in them.  I add to, remove from, and audit these locations on a handheld device.  I unload trucks and open all the boxes.  I get people their merchandise when they ordered it and make sure it gets to them within 5 minutes."
good,"the pay was terriable, didnt like the manangers, but i always had people work with my schedule"
good,Didn't care for it. Management was without skill.  Place was just a hole to work at
good,"I worked in Loss Prevention at Sears I loved it, but it was really bad pay.  I made 8 dollars an hour and I found out a month after I got hired that they no longer did raises....Needless to say I did not want to make 8 dollars an hour for the rest of my life so I found a better LP job making way more money.  My advice is if you want LP experience Sears or Kmart is the way to get your foot in the door, but not a career to make there because the pay just sucks that bad as well as the hours which s usually 25 hours a week.  You also have quote which can be hard to make when the company you work for is not a very busy place.  It's a really fun job though!"
good,Lack of stability and security means overuse of part time staff to avoid awarding benefits. Seasonal periods of high and low demand mean many people hold down two or three jobs to keeps the money flowing.
good,"A typical included reviewing sales and working with our planner to make any adjustments i  had a great relationship with my co-workers which consisted of planners, replenishment staff, and planogramming team.  The hardest part of the job was working with continued sales declines as this has been an issue for Sears for quite a while.  The most enjoyable part of the job was developing product for the stores."
good,"Each day I deal with families including children, people with disabilities and large groups. I photograph sessions within the required time, edit the photos and attempt to up sell packages to individuals geared toward their specific needs. I speak with clients on a one to one basis to build a strong long lasting relationship insuring their return. My job also consists of taking inventory, organizing deliveries, clearing packages from our computer system, cleaning the camera rooms, prop room, and general work area, and taking proper care of camera equipment. Also I am required to assist clients who are unhappy."
good,"Walk in and on the floor i go. Take a couple rounds on the floor see if an members need any assistance. If not i tend to my aisle starting from one side of my department to an other, cleaning up and zoning. Find out what management is closing or in my shift and ask to see if they have any suggestions on what to do specifically in my department other then the regular clean and restock. The hardest part of my day at work is when there arent too many members around, my most enjoyable is when the rush hour begins."
good,"Pleasant to work with co workers and management team."
good,"For me, It was basically report to your supervisor, do the assignments assigned, and that's it. It was just an internship, an unpaid one in fact. I learned a different way to fold clothes, but it was difficult to keep an area looking nice, due to the customers destroying my hard work."
good,"A typical day at Sears/ Kmart can be enjoyable in some ways; we have new cultural methods that all Sears Holdings Corp entities have started to implement. All associates are expected to abide by the new ways to increase motivation, recognition and better their actions. The new rollout has certainly been a positive turn for the company and has everyone more engaged and feeling appreciated."
good,"Typical day was making customers number one, despite any situation."
good,I didn't know anything about being an In home specialist. I felt that the job wasn't really for me because of the lack of knowledge and the hours worked were very short
good,"Job is all about statistical performance. It dont matter if you are a best repairman in the world, management will find it`s way to feel you like you are working not enough. Best way to stay in position is to make more sales. "
good,Be prepared to work long hours and have little work-life balance.  The ratio is around 80% work and 20% life.  Typical day starts at either 6am or 7 am and ends around 7pm the same day.  The typical day is 12 hour shifts with no breaks except for lunch.  Sometimes shifts can be 15 hours in duration based upon need of the business.  It is a very intense one-on-one environment (internal and external customers).   The hardest part of the job is the lack of recognition given at both levels (subordinate for 'thanks' and supervisor for 'good job').  The most enjoyable part of the job is actually two events.  I had the opportunity to shape and help promote several people over my time with Sears.  The second part was turning around a poor performing unit (potential closing store) to a consistent sales performer and operationally sound unit.
good,Maintian good friendly customer service. Show and have loyalty to our customers.
good,I absolutely loved my coworkers in Loss Prevention. I got along with everybody and became part of a productive team right away.
good,"- Typical day consists of oil changes, batteries, and tires"
good,"while working at Sears, and Sears Outlet I've work and met many people from all walks of life.  Although the pay is not considered great, its not bad for retail commission sales.  With some effort you can realistically make in excess of $11-$12 per hour.  Management seems to have a hands off approach, which means they are not watching every move you make, but rather leave you to make your own decisions based on the training and company policies and procedures.  They are numbers driving culture, so your sales goals must! be met or otherwise you get additional training from management.  I would recommend this job to a person wanting a sales commission job.  I would not recommend this job to a person who wants to make a steady paycheck monthly, simply because your pay may fluctuate.  A nice part time job for students, or adults who want just that, a part time job."
good,"You are given a route first thing in the morning.  A typical route consists of 7-8 calls per day.  You stay out in the field until the calls are complete.    "
good,"A typical day at Sears Portrait Studio consisted of checking the client list for the day to confirm no cancelations. Cold calling people about deals and promotions for the studio and trying to get them to book an appointment. Going out of the studio and into the Sears store to inform customers of promotions and get them to book appointments with the studio. Cleaned and organized the studios before clients arrived. Once a client arrived you would greet them introduce yourself confirm what the purpose of the shoot is (example; Birthday, Christmas card, Updates...) an average photo shoot took approx 25 - 35 mins to shoot and edit. Edits included black and white photos, sepia photos, creating collages, creating cards and announcements. Once the photo shoot was completed you would then sit the client down to show them all of the photos and edits you would gage their response to the photos and see how many they liked then offer them packages."
good,This was by far the worst job i have every had early morning shifts that wasnt ran by anyone that knew what they were doing if the shift leader was late someone else that didnt know anything about the pricing team or department came in to make a mess and it was up to us to fix and stay late no being paid over time or anything
good,"A great job to start off at.  You get your basic customer service and retail skills down fairly quickly. You learn quickly and do you work slowly, that's how they liked it."
good,Job was very simple help customers an stock the store and help clean up. Only downfall is that with 4 managers telling you what to do and them not talking to each other can sometimes get you into trouble.
good,"Not really a stressful job, but it wasn't the most exciting. Not great, not bad."
good,The district manager bold face lied to me. He is very misleading and only looks out for himself
good,"This company was actually CPI, a company contracted by Sears to run portrait studios in their stores. The company is now out of business."
good,In this position I had something new to do everyday and met new people
good,"-Daily coach and train cashiers to greet customers, make daily metric goals to drive profitable sales"
good,"Over all sears is not a fun place to work, how ever the Lands End Dept work together as team to get the job done and we all enjoy working with each other"
good,"Sears is a pretty good place to work at as long as you stay focused and positive. I worked there when I lived in WA and they were happy to transfer me when I told them I was moving to CA. But it is a very fast paced job. At the Los Angeles branch, cleaning up after customers takes up the entire shift. They rarely return things where they found them and they spill food and drinks often. Most of the managers were nice but usually stressed out from assisting the many disgruntled customers. My co-workers were pretty lazy. Their 15 minute breaks usually ended up more like half an hour."
good,"I began Sears on the last day of school and I enjoyed my job as a merchandise and customer assistant I was then promoted to Loss Prevention Associate and 2 days later my LPM quit. The worse part was that she quit the day before inventory. I didn't have a clue. But I partnered with the operations manager and my coworkers in LP and made the best of it. I was over looked as a LP associate because the manager at the time was not a fan of mine. Later I made the decision to leave Sears after 2 1/2 years. But before I left I was managed by one of the smartest LP managers I've ever come in contact with. I became a homemaker but later decided that I enjoyed loss prevention. I returned to Sears as a part-time agent and worked at Macy's during the morning. I was approached by a Sears DLPM and promoted to a low performing store where I quickly implemented shortage control strategies and retrained the current staff on shoplifter techniques, implemented the associate call award program and recognition programs. I worked with the store management team to build a relationship with the operations, core compliance, human resources and facility maintenance, side of business. With hard work and core compliance implementation, I was able to reduce the shrink, WC and General liability dollars to plan making the store more profitable. I was then promoted to Loss Prevention Supervisor in the Logistics company. I succeeded by working with some wonderful individuals who had a mindset of winning. While working in the DC I Learned how the entire operation worked in order to prevent internal and external"
good,want you to do everything but what your job title was. Benefits wasnt that good.
good,"Apparel group has been successful since moving to SF in 2010, however overall health of Sears is a concern."
good,"Sears is a dying company mired in debt that has not seen a profit since the very early 2000's.  Much of this is due to over-expansion and mismanagement of funds.  It has many appealing programs and much potential for success, but the corruption of the company does not allow that."
good,"I managed as a district manager/ studio manager. I learned "
good,"Typical day at work consisted of meeting expectations set by routing (in re time frames for service) and daily emphasis on customer surveys that rated customer experience with call set-up. I learned to deal with customers with tact and diplomacy and that there are some customers that were not happy with anything done by management or service technician. Management put too much emphasis on numbers and sales of maintenance contracts, water filters and add-on sales instead of customer satisfaction with the repair of the appliances. The co-workers were, for the most part, easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was meeting unrealistic expectations of management and promises made to the customers that were seldom kept. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and satisfying the customers."
good,"I was really good at the credit and rewads, but its a factor that will either keep your job or make you lose it. Either you sign folks up or your gone is not a good way to run a company and it runs guests and workers out the door."
good,Like the title says I was hired at the wrong time . It would not be long before they would closes the doors for good at the Macon Mall.
good,"This was first job in Canada, it was a seasonal work just tried to get some Canadian experience."
good,Great job and comprensive training. I loved this job I just wished it paid more and had better managment.
good,the photography n sales where fun. From Oct to Christmas u r really busy. Everything was really easy to learn.

good,"I clock in, work my freight for my department, assist customers with finding items, answer telephone calls pertaining to my department, help out on check outs when needed. I also unload trucks twice a week. I like my co workers. We all get along and help each other. There is no real hard part of my job. The best part of the job is the joy I get when I get compliments from customers for just doing my job."
good,"There are so many layers to this company that projects are never truly approved and countless revisions have to be made on any given project.  Holiday seasons here are brutally busy and youll never enjoy a holiday again while employed here.  Also, the big decisions made at this company are not based on research or trends, its based on a suit pointing their finger and saying ""because I said so.""  A lot of teams here do not work well together and would rather point and finger and place blame on others before accepting responsibility.  The casual and flexible environment does not come close to make up for the lack of competent management."
good,"Every day was practically the same so there is never anything to lose track of. Most of the time, you work alone. All my coworkers were incredibly supportive and even after almost a year since resigning, I still stay in touch with them. The hardest part of the job was getting people to apply for the Sears Mastercard. I felt as if I was encouraging bad credit for my customers. Plus, the managers would get on us if we weren't at 200% every single day. But the managers were amazing. They were all more than just supervisors, they were practically our friends too, and they made sure to maintain that friendship on a professional level. "
good,Just another typical Retail job. Salary was base pay plus commission depending on how much you sold. Management wasn't the best unfortunately. WE would be overstaffed or understaffed at all times.
good,"great people"
good,"Managing all aspects of a fast paced tire and repair facility.  I have learned multi task managment, and working as a team, as well as how corporate america works."
good,"Being at this company I had the privilege of learning all aspects of parts and service, including mangement, payroll, sales, service and call center. "
good,"From working at Sears I have improved upon my observation and team work skills. I currently work within a group of two investigators in which we make use of CCTV and physical patrolling to detect and apprehend shoplifters. The most difficult part of the job is the fact that we are understaffed in the Loss Prevention department, at times there is only one investigator scheduled for a shift. "
good,I love helping people day to day at work. I love solving problems and turning someones situation completely around. That's the satisfaction I gain from working with the Sears company.
good,"I work as a Sales Representative in the Hardware Department which includes lawn and garden, fitness, and home improvements, I've learned how to be successful in sales. I also work the odd shift in electronics as well as working with the signing group putting up sale signs to standards weekly. Mid level management is great to work with. The hardest part of the job is overcoming customer objections. The rewarding part of the job is having your customers return to see you for another sale.  "
good,une expérience enrichissante tant au niveau professionnel que humain
good,Offer excellent opportunities toward career pathing and getting people variety of jobs.  Incentives were great which motivated people to work harder
good,a typical place is selling products and interact with customers
good,This is basically a good job for high school or college students.
good,"Usually open the cash registers, making sure that the work stations are clean and tidy. "
good,Sears over the past few years has declined in quality of managment. 
good,My first week working there i was left alone not knowing what i was doing and had to keep calling for a csm and half the time they didn't know what they were doing either. I learned to do things on my own and asking alot of questions. Managment would leave me by myself for hours without teaching me everything. Not all co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning everything by myself. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers that came in even if i didn't know something they were very understanding.
good,"everyday was doing something different, learned different jobs, most of the managers were great to work with, along with the co-workers, but not very many would stay long enough to really get to know them. the jobs were not hard to learn and most of them were easy to do. "
good,"I was a sales person. I went on deliveries. I assembled lawn equipment, tools, etc. I was over the tools department. I was also in charge of making signs. I did the daily deposits."
good,"I only worked at Sears for a year. I worked in the loss prevention department. In that department we prevented product loss from internal and external theft. I learned how to interact with local law enforcement, and how to handle stressful situations because of dealing with uncooperative shoplifters. My manager was very good to me and taught me a lot about Sears. My co-workers were also very helpful and welcomed me with open arms. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with uncooperative shoplifters. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with. They really were a good group of people to work with."
good,Management was very poor they seemed very incompetent in how they should manage their employees they never gave any direct instructions on how customers should be dealt with when a manager isn't around.
good,"I sold major appliances and later, mattresses. As the market changed, it became more difficult to make a living selling appliances. Commission rates dropped and customers bought more on line. Mattresses commissions were fair, prices were outstanding and Sears had a good mix of mattresses."
good,"Merchandising, inventory management, ad set up."
good,Prepare and run all day to day operation functions
good,It was a laid back environment and also a quiet place to work.
good,Typical day is handle customer request for parts/service
good,"Sears was an okay place to work. It was a steady job. Pay wasnt that good, but as a stock worker what do you expect. Best part was they were more than willing to work around my college schedule."
good,"The specialty fitness concept is a great idea, but logistics and other issues make the company get in it's own way."
good,"A typical day involved selling to many customers throughout the day, giving a sales pitch slightly tailored to each person's needs. I learned how to implement the Sears Outlet approach into other applications to become very good at selling. I also learned through experience how to carry myself as a member of the management team."
good,"great place to start but no room to grow or raises . goals are not hard to reach when you have a team but when your alone its difficult , hands on /off policy is not explained . best part of the job is being friendly with management they help out a lot"
good,Not enough people to much to do. they dont give you space to work with when unloading trucks. stock room is really small with lots in it. place is a disaster.
good,Directly handling customer orders through use of tools provided. Ensuring that each product is delivered on time so that customers receive their orders in a timely and professional manner.
good,"A typical day would also consist of me loading unloading trucks,also I helped at the register which is something I learned from this job,The hardest part was the weather,most enjoyable part was the hours,unfortunately it was not that big of a company and eventually went bankrupt although the management and co-workers where easy to get along with."
good,Good co-workers. Long days.
good,"Sears was loading and unloading of merchandise, keep a clean warehouse. Stack merchandise on to racks. Distribute items to assigned floors. Unpack skids. Scan items into inventory. Fast pace to work in but not enough hours. Management was nice."
good,"A typical day at Sears included getting any deliveries ready for the outgoing shuttle, wrapping any merchandise that needed to be picked up and unwrapping merchandise taking it to the floor and assembling it."
good,"Unfortunately the job is very stressful, not because of the amount of work to be done but from the lack of customers. Being in a commissioned sales position, it is very difficult to sell when there is no one in the store!"
good,Great place to work if in school. The management was very nice to its employees.
good,"My daily routine at the office consists of assisting customers and service providers in finding resolution to their cases besides managing other issues related to customer care, marketing and business management."
good,do 12 hrs of work in an 8 hr day. expected to meet too many numbers.
good,"Very flexible schedule, great atmosphere for gaining knowledge and customer service experience."
good,"Working at Sears Home Improvement call center was very fast pace and fun at the same time. A typical day would be come to work and socialize for a quick min, attend your morning meeting and then your on the phones offering estimates to potential customers for Home Improvement projects."
good,I've learned alot about working with people and how to handle customers.
good,My typical day at work was in the mattress department. I made sure the department was neat and clean. I learned that helping customers is not just fun for me but helpful for me as well.
good,"Sears is accepting of everyone, willing to work with your schedule, and an easy enough job to do for 40 hours a week. However, some managers tend to play favorites towards their friends when scheduling hours or deciding who receives a full time position."
good,"Bad pay, management isn't great unless you stay there for a while. job security, its a job they can fire you whenever they want."
good,Daily food prep .. positive interactions with both customers and coworkers. The hardest part of the job was working alone when hours were cut and the most enjoyable part of the job was the daily visits from customers.
good,Typically I would be the one who would early open my department and make sure merchandise are customer ready.
good,Nice place to work if you're a student or in between jobs. Flexible hours. Commissioned style of pay.
good,Number requirements of commissioned employees during probationary time is strictly enforced which is why I am no longer there.
good,I Had a pretty good job while we were open
good,"A typical day involved selling appliances, setting planograms, and keeping appliance section clean and presentable. It is a great place to learn how to be assertive in sales as you are required to hit metrics for accessories, protection agreements, etc. The management is poor as they tend to hire people who hang in clicks. Most of the managers will go on break together, so help is not there when you need it. Most of my co-workers were very good. Since it was a commission job, you will get a few greedy people that will do or say anything to get a sale. The hardest part of the job was stacking washers and dryers on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and fellow workers."
good,It was a good place to work to make sure the needs of your family is taken care of.
good,"Was a fun place to work, fast paced and educational with training. Was an individually owned franchise store, so Sears Associates were not offered the benefits like the Associates at the larger Sears stores like we see in the mall. Compensation depended on sales and was commission based and some days there would be days when not one customer would come through the doors which made it hard to depend on a paycheck that did not have a hourly wage. When there were advertised sales on TV or in the Paper, it would become very busy all at once and then we would be short-handed. Smaller town made the traffic and sales very unpredictable and only one employee there at times made it impossible to keep theft activity down. Store was eventually sold by the owner shortly after I left."
good,A typicall day at work was doing my job! I learned how to deal with people in the very nice maner! The manger was more concerned about the inspectors then us girls who did the hardest part of the job! I gotta long with my co-workers pretty well!
good,this store is a good place to work if you are a college student looking for extra money for holidays or breaks would not recommend as a careeer there is no room for advancement and growth
good,"Typical cashier duties, helping customers, ringing out items, cleaning. My managers were okay, seemed stressed most of the time. Co-workers were nice. Pay was not great."
good,"Had to play security, not enough workers to help, some workers don't want to do there part, management at the time was running around with his head cut off. Some co workers were ok."
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work. There was always something new to learn or to be changed. Ive effectively learned how to overcome situations without being properly trained or having the proper tools, to work with a team, and to always look for ways to improve. My co-workers are wonderful. Sears only tries to hire those best for the job. The hardest part of the job is learning to overcome obstacles and problems without being properly equiped or trained. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Being able to serve people and help them acheive complete satisfaction."
good,"5 star employer for 8/10 yrs, then it all changed: from the motto: needs of the business: and that eventually spilled out into front line staff..all the pros diminished.."
good,I had a great job leading the cafe team. I got to do a variety of tasks which I enjoy doing.
good,"My position at Lands End Shop,allowed me to interact with a wide variety of people.Each day I was responsible for maintaining the sales floor to Lands End standards, keep an in-depth knowledge of Lands End products, and assist customers with online orders or in store purchases. I learned to work with a team, keep a sales goal for each day, and learn to solve problems on the spot."
good,"Sears Outlet is a decent place to work. I started there knowing it would be a transition job and it has lived up to that. The company does not care about any employees except for those that make it money. The only people that did not loose hours when they started chopping hours were the two with the highest sales in the store. They did loose some hours, but only about five instead of twenty. The job is pretty typical for retail; help customers, clean stock, straighten, etc. Management is pretty immature and it shows in their leadership. The plus side is that they allow a lot of flexibility but come down on you when it fits them, not every time the infraction happens. The pay is not enough for the environment the person has to work in. There is no insulation or air conditioning so during the heat waves it got over a hundred degrees inside the store. Management stocked cold water, but it was only for the customers not the employees."
good,"I came in expecting a fast-moving, consistent environment."
good,"My job as a maintenance mechanic was good, My job was always changing, I like doing something different everyday. My coworkers cared about one another we were like a family. If someone had a problem there was someone you could confide in. Management really took interest in what workers had to say."
good,"Being a full time student work days were limited to just 4 hours a day throughout the week and 8-9 hours on weekends. I did gain a better idea of working in a shop environment and working and learning mechanical work, along side with auto body training. I felt management was poor being it was based on favoritism, certain jobs were given to only certain people, and hours work cut and given to only a few chosen individuals. The hardest part of the job was understanding how to maintain my schooling and part time job together. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with people my age, and also learning from the older senior technicians."
good,I enjoyed my place of employment and the people that I worked with. I loved comming in contact with people from all over on a daily basis.
good,"Cleaning, selling, searching. You are either cleaning the sales floor from customers shopping, at a cash register ringing and ringing, or helping a customer find something."
good,Love the Job and people But there is no room for advancement.
good,"Although the Sears I was at didn't have a lot of foot traffic, the customers we did receive were very loyal to the store for the most part. The people I worked with there have worked there for years and have served generations of families in the neighborhood. I learned that making a sale is not convincing a customer that it's the right for them, but to establish a personal relationship as well and just talking to them as if they were a friend of yours. Management were pretty good about their jobs for the most part. Sometimes they'll work with you with a customer or a sale, other times they didn't or couldn't."
good,Nothing bad to say. Engaged with clients and customers to generate business and residual clients on a daily basis.
good,Management was good. Store management not so much. Too focused on numbers for the company and not the actual customer. Low pay.
good,"Stocking shoes, Helping out customers, Putting up new signs and taking down old signs."
good,"Although Sears is commiteed to keeping the customer company, or as they say in their company values; I found them to be a little greedy and uncaring towards customers. Yes they lowered alot of prices and changed their return policy but still they don't always seem to be in it 100% for the customer. Being working tehir 1 year, I made great friends ranging from different age groups and everyday working there was better made with caring employees. The best part about working here was also the staff discount. Other than that there are no good benefits, you can only get full time positions if you are a manager (really dumb) and they hourly wage is low. Better luck with a convienence store or Subway."
good,"A typical day at work for me is walking the call center floor and assisting advocates from all lines of business with questions, price overrides, Service contract information, and handling escalated calls for the advocate. Assisted with manager escalations as well if one wasn't available to speak with."
good,"Being a cashier was not exciting at all, probably because of the fact that there was very little traffic coming in and out of Sears, which left me with nothing to do. Also, I couldn't straighten up as much as I would have liked to because they expected us to stay near the cash wrap. So basically I had to circle a very small area for about 5 hours a day."
good,loved the job district was hard to deal with as they changed rule by the hour and always different answers to the same questions
good,Meeting and greeting new people who shop for appliances.
good,If you like sales good place to start. not to much chance to go up
good,"Windshield time everyday, 10 to 12 customers a day, meet all kind of people, some great co-worker but a lot of not so trustworthy ones as well with management"
good,"I have been employed by Sears Holdings in Lake Mary FLA for 2 months and for the name to be so big the company is not doing well as far as the call center go, we were forced to share seats which made it impossible for stability, you had to come to work almost 30 minutes early to find a seat and if you worked afternoons you would have to clock in and stand around and wait for a morning rep to leave to go home and take over their seat. The call center had a bad bug problem and to top it off the bathrooms were not very advanced."
good,I like what I do. It's just that the way we do some of the things don't make too much sense.
good,"Managemet:Over all it was a good job, but bad,, I mean they cut your hours if they didn't get enouf people buying things, so that was bad! Could 'n count on a good check.Had to get a better job."
good,Great stores to work. Very productive in sales. Employees was fun to work with. No drame.
good,"A typical day at work would be finding customers on the floor or following up with any customers with a phone call. It's a job with its pulse dependent on the economy, if consumer confidence is down expect slow days, if people feel financially secure expect big sales. Management can be uncoordinated and give mixed signals on expectations."
good,"This job was just ok. I enjoyed the people I worked with very much, but this ended up being a seasonal position."
good,Basically the position consisted of selling products to customers in the store. Responsibilities also included assisting with inventory and setting up sales ads.
good,"On a daily basis, I would balance pleasing the customer with following policy. I would direct, encourage, and challenge cashiers working in my department to efficiently accomplish work. I was always answering the phone, ringing transactions, and paging for customers who needed assistance."
good,This was a parttime job 15-25 hours per week. A typical day was keying in over 60 applications. Contacting cumtomers for additional information Co-works were very nice
good,"It's a job, and it's paying the bills, but there is just two much to explain, but I can really see why Sears with all its connections in the home improvement, appliance, clothing arena they still can't keep pace with Walmart or Target."
good,I gained a lot of experience at Sears that was invaluable to me.
good,I enjoyed the time I was there but at the same time I felt there was no room for me to grow any further. I appreciate the time they had given me to work there but at this time I really would like to explore my opportunities within a company that will allow me to utliize my skills and be able to allow me to grow accordingly.
good,"At the beginning of any shift I first check all fitting rooms to make sure they are clean. Afterwards, I walk up to the cash-wrap to check on any go-backs. Go-backs are merchandise that need to be put back to their specific departments. If those two are done I will move on to cleaning the department that I'm currently stationed at. Throughout the day I will get codes from a cashier or manager to assistant a customer. All day I repeat this process."
good,"Any simple task can be a big deal when working with the public, But i believe and come to find out that, all problems can be resolve if you can listen to what they really need or want, when something goes wrong you apologize and try to resolve the problem or bring somebody into the conversation that can resolve it."
good,"Like any retail environment, you will work varied hours, weekends and holidays. Sears is a company in turmoil. They continue to close store around the country. If you are a salaried manager don't expect to have any personal life. You will be working 6 days a week, 10-14 hours at a crack."
good,I worked here when I was 18 and it was a decent job. On a typical day I worked on the register as well as placed orders online for customers. I would also organize and stock the sales floors. The management was good I got promoted really fast. The hardest part of working here was the lack of hours. At the time of my resignation I was only getting scheduled 16 hours a week and it was during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of this job was my coworkers. They were always very friendly and I am still friends with a few of them to this day.
good,customer engaging and sales oriented. Sometimes it was busy and sometimes slow but it seemed like all we heard from managers was that we didn't do good enough.
good,I enjoy working there because it improve my communication skill and learn the needs from the customers. I learn the rules of selling items and how to make people buy items without hassle.
good,Major retailer Sears acquired Big box Kmart and eliminated food departments because they weren't consistent with it's prime directive which is hardlines.
good,Sear was a great place to work then when they started talking about closeing store it became unbearble giving you unrealistic sales goals for the slow ecomony and when you dont make to goal they embaress you in a store meeting. I dont know and probably not at all sears but thats how it was in mine. when i needed to move to another position due to stress induceing illness they werent gonna help me so i voulantary left the organization and was able to get healthy agian.
good,"A typical day at kmart is assisting customers on the sales floor, Maintaining your check out lane, Checking out customers in various departments, Doing reshop(putting returns and items not wanted by customers back on the shelves."
good,"My main responsibilities include purging the stockroom, setting the men's dept. to typical/company standards, and creating displays through out the department to captivate customers. I enjoy assisting my regulars(those that come in at least once a week) and informing them of the current promotions and most recent merchandise."
good,"there always something to do. mangers can be a handful but they're substantial. the hardest part of the job were the unpleasant customers and keep on your poker face, but the easy part was people leaving with smiles."
good,My day is easy and fun I learn how people are everyday because I have a lot of customer's that come in everyday with different need. My manager is very helpful and teach me different things everyday. I get along with my co-workers and we work as a team. The hardest part of the day is when I get a customer that gives me a hard time but when they see that I can help them with their problem that's the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,"When I was scheduled to work, I was given clear assignments which were easy to complete. I could take a brief break when needed, and the 45 minute lunch was generous."
good,I have made great friends while at Sears. We are usually understaffed and are responsible for more than time allows.
good,Opportunity to move up corporate ladder.
good,Sears has been able to work around my school schedule when I was attending Central Michigan University and they also worked around my other work schedules.
good,"Sears & Roebuck is a company oriented around achieving its metrics more often than not at the expense of its employees and customers. If employees are unable to maintain the high standard of acquisition, there is no place for them in the company. The Sears I work for has one of the highest turnover rates of all the stores in the entire mall. It's about goals and not people."
good,In this work envionment there was alot of effort that went into your paycheck as an appointment specialist. At times there was alot of fun and incentives but only small windows for advancements. A person had to be cut out to perform this job for long periods of time.
good,"Worked here through college and still am, looking for advancement in a bigger company with more options."
good,had a hard time requesting to have my starting wage matched to the state required minimum wage.
good,I currently work for this company and it had been a great experience. I have gained valuable knowledge that will be beneficial in my future endeavours.
good,Sears at the time was an ok company they provided me with work for about a 1 year before I left for closer employment
good,Working in the shipping side of sears is easy enough if you have the back for the work. It pays decently and they don't ask much of you other than that you unload and load some trucks.
good,"i work part time and they changed the 401k policy where i wont be able to take my 401k out if something happened to the company. the new softlline lead is horrible she doesn't know what she is doing, barley see her around, always in the office, always hands a customer she is working with to an associate instead of figuring out the problem herself. shes just horrible at her job and its sad that she got the position instead of someone else who would know exactly what to do as softline lead."
good,"Sears isn't a really great place to work. Well at least the sears I work for. The management team is rude, careless and rarely communicate with the employees. Everybody walks around with some sort of chip on their shoulders. From the initial interview to me actually starting, it was all a very unprofessional experience. I wouldn't do it again."
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears however the business climate and store closures made it difficult to achieve financial goals.   "
good,"Sears was my first job and I drove 30 minutes away to work my shift after class. The manager and other employees were pretty understanding of this as my first job and tried hard to teach me. After about 2 months I understood a lot and was comfortable in my position however, I was seasonal and soon went from working 35 hours a week to 12. It wasn't worth driving across town for so I quit but it was fun and interesting for the time. During black Friday the Sears network all registers ran off of went down and all items had to be typed in by hand. Being the youngest of the crew by decades I was able to be the fastest line and had the highest item count for the night. You could tell though that the company wasn't doing well so as sad as it was to see it go it was time. RIP"
good,"In general, Sears was understaffed (I was employed in Warehouse, but needed to help in other departments from time to time). Sears provides a Flexible work schedule, and has friendly Mangament. Also, coworkers get along. However, there's a lack of needed supplies in the warehouse. Business attire is casual."
good,Management is kinda racist and 100% show favoritism. Won't promote someone with experience and skills within the company but would hire a friend and promote their friend within 2 months even though the company policy states that you can transfer to another department or get a promotion at least until after six months after getting hired.
good,Enjoyed the guys I worked with but management was real pain in the butt all the time. All and all the pay for the work that you had to do wasn't really that bad
good,productive and fun workplace. I worked during the week morning to afternoon. The manager was not the most friendly boss i have ever had he was really strict and controlling. The most enjoyable parts were the breaks and the store discount.
good,The company is ok. They try to keep up with the times. People buy on line instead of coming to the store. It is a same that people do not come out anymore.
good,"Sears me me brindo la oportunidad de aprender de muchos departamentos. Lo que mas me gusto fue el area de Electronica, y el servicio al cliente en esa area, de verdad me apasionaba."
good,"Since The Day I Started I have learned the basics such as How to treat a customer and then how to work with shoes. Its pretty basic, but very fast paced. Hardest part of My job Is Multitasking For example Storing shoes And helping a customer at the same time is pretty challenging. Most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer and making them feel comfortable."
good,"I like the interaction with the customers & coworkers. I also like my tasks of things that i worked on in store. Working in retail was really nice i got to meet new and different people, and the experience."
good,I went to work for this company with the anticipation of helping customers and supporting the department but it turned out to be more like a competition in the department instead of helping one another.
good,a typical day at sears was work just as any other place we wanted to mach sure we help everyone.........................................................
good,It was a good place to work but it did not pay what I wanted after being promised advancement which never happened. They closed down a 4 years after I left there.
good,"Although I learned a lot and met some amazing people, Sears is very hard to recommend because it is still struggling to keep many stores open. If your area still has stores that are busy and thriving I would recommend it as a good place to learn to manage people and to sell a variety of products."
good,"The job is laid back. That is the positive. The negative is that it is laid back too though. If you aren't part of their click, you will be ostracized and ignored for the most part. No one will bother you per-say but that's just it. If you are looking for a place to work that is like a High-School click, then this is the place for you. If you are looking for a professional environment where people are mature and recognize your talents, then I would say look elsewhere."
good,in my time there all they did was push for credit and rewards members .its difficult because people think the store is going to close so they don’t want to apply . The shop your way can go from 100% to 50% and they get mad . It’s just that one person that doesn’t have rewards and doesn’t want to sign up .their version of employee appreciation was picking out snacks from a reusable bag . I can buy that stuff from the vending machine .  I had people cut up their credit card in Front of me and tell me to find a new job cause I won’t have one in a few months .
good,"But that’s pretty much it, since the people can’t really make up for lost sales. The atmosphere is tragically desperate, and if I was paid more I might stay to help. But it’s just not enough pay or benefits to consider it."
good,Sears originally was a great place with opportunity to grow. However they are not in for long haul. Bad financial planning and future. No work like balance and no full time hourly associates
good,"Sears was a fun job laid back and easy jobs included unloading trucks, oicking orders, and loading customers purchases, and every once in a while you will stock hours during the spring and summer and good but they drop down around fall and winter"
good,"Sears has devoted customers AND employees for a reason,  They provide a good work environment, with opportunities for performance based bonuses in most positions.  Though Sears by all news reports is ""circling the drain""  and does not seem to be a wise long term employment choice."
good,"Sears seemed to care more about getting customers to open credit cards, and less about making sure the costumer received good service in a timely fashion. The managers were unorganized and our store was incredibly understaffed."
good,"Sears Auto was a great place to work.  A good manager makes a tremendous difference! If you are willing to know your job thoroughly and put in time and hard work, you can do well!  Unfortunately Sears Auto no longer exists in Wisconsin, but I learned a tremendous amount of practical skills, and industry knowledge.  The shipping receiving system is antiquated, and most problems required some critical thinking skills to solve, but it was one of my favorite jobs thus far!  The upper management cared tremendously about steering each auto center wisely and successfully!"
good,It was a fast pace job packing boxes and loading them on a pallet the employees was nice and the pay was ok but I didn’t like the hours because it intervened with me attending college
good,Seasonal work for extra cash. Customers are usually retirees. Alot of customer interaction to help them find items. Work hours are scattered. Do not go in expecting a set schedule.
good,"My daytime hours were ok, pay was not, very busy which was ok- made the day go by fast (not so much lately though)"
good,"Very easy job. after I received my list of appliances to deliver I wrap them, loaded the truck and ready to go and deliver the products. GPS was already set with the address to follow."
good,"dommage pour l'entreprise et les employés . J'avais de très bonnes collèges. J' avais une belle clientèle , des femmes et des hommes , ils me faisait confiance , j'ai passé du bon temps. je garde  un bon souvenir."
good,en general hay buen ambiente de trabajo pero nunca faltan los que sienten que la empresa les debe la vida y siento que ya decayó mucho
good,"en este empleo aprendí a valorar la oportunidad que se brinda, un lugar con mucho aprendizaje sin embargo, la paga es poca; la misma presión de las vacantes hace que en ocasiones se olviden de reservar lo principal que es la calidad humana, servicio a los empleados como el comedor y sobre todo el cumplir las reglas como el horario. Te hace fuerte en decisiones y conococimientos."
good,"The store manager was not enjoyable to work with as he came in late, left early and usually took excessively long (1 1/2 -3) hour lunches. The rest of the team and the assistant manager were fun to work with, and morale was high whenever the store manager was not around. There was no room for advancement without relocating. The pay was base plus commission. The base pay was not enough to live on, and the commission pay drastically decreased when Sear's filed bankruptcy because clients were afraid that the location would be closing."
good,I enjoyed my job I would help customers fix any appliance issues they had management did help out on the floor the reps had to help each other management only cared about doing as little work as possible
good,"I enjoyed what little time I spent there. Flexible hours, friendly co-workers and managers, and decent pay. However the managers were very aggressive when it came to getting customers approved for credit cards. Very few customers were actually eligible for approval and somehow that was the fault of the employees. You would eventually see your hours cut and eventually a complete department change or dismissal."
good,"Can be fun depending on your Management team. Offers training and development to help you succeed at your job. "
good,Never enough time for service calls and sell sell sell a sears home warranty it is more about selling than serving the customers properly when you are there to fix the appliances
good,"It was fun while it lasted. It was a relaxed atmosphere and I had a lot of fun playing with clothes. The only reason I left was because I figured our store was next to be closed down since hours were declining. It lasted for a little bit, but eventually they all did."
good,Promueven la cultura de respeto y los lideres no la siguen. Dan ahorro cada año y lo duplican
good,"The company was a very good place to work before the changes in merging Kmart and Sears together."
good,"While this location is closing, the work environment is easy going. Had opportunities to promote from within to other facilities but are difficult to get. Probably would have stayed here until retirement."
good,"While at Sears I  was responsible for helping the customer to select the appliance that best fit their requirements. I would place the order, and enter i into the system, and follow up on deliveries. Sears provided extensive training with regards to customer service which was ongoing throughout my tenure."
good,"Overall mediocre place to work. Nothing particularly terrible to say, but this place flew through management members like none other. "
good,I enjoyed my time either in Customer Support or as a Customer Service Advisor for the Auto Department. I was able to help many people with getting their vehicle safely back on the road.
good,had a good training program and paid you to take it. promoted from with in company. mandatory break and lunch time so no one could make you work thru them.
good,"they work well with your schedule. they pay minimum wage for most jobs, constantly understaffed and the hours are always fluctuating. the managers are nice but this is not the place you want to work to build a future in."
good,"I liked the people, the sales and the productivity. I learned to use the scanner and the cash registar. I liked the people and they were helpful.It was touch screen, but it was a little out-of-date."
good,10 hour work days 5 days per week. very stressful employed by sears for 43 years. culture was never learned due to upper management problems. used to be a great place to work until the last 10 years or so. now they have closed a lot of the stores including all in my area .
good,Slow pace easy work task job requirements made me travel across the metropolitan area employee discount was decent the work hours where reliable staff very friendly
good,Management could be better.  The pay was decent depending on which department you worked in.  Great coworkers made the environment better.  Not much room for advancement
good,I worked here part time selling appliances . 100 percent commission so it was not steady . There was not much of a culture and little employee appreciation . Really depends on the story . The Irving Texas store was decent
good,"Sears hasn't given benefits in years. The only benefits I've gotten is Vacation Leave. Other than that, nothing, no health care, no dental, and certainly no pension!"
good,"I loved my coworkers, and pretty much the only problem that I had was the cashier lead abusing her power without permission of the manager. She has since been let go. other than that it was a pleasant laid back place to work with it's occasional rushes."
good,I found that working at Sears was good. I liked my immediate manager and the staff.  Sadly we closed down not once but twice and now I am looking again.
good,Decent place to work until all the down sizing started. Then moral went down hill.  Employees were very concerned that the next morning they would be let go.
good,It was a good temporary job for my situation.  Consistent hours and pay. The manager was real good but  not all the managers were as good as the one I had.
good,"I went into Sears for a long-term employment with opportunity for advancement, only to be announced as a closing store. I could not have asked for a better opportunity to learn and work within such an amazing environment."
good,I cant say much about Sears as I was only there about 10 weeks before they closed.  But the time there seemed like a family atmosphere enjoyed going to work
good,Las capacitaciones que te brindan y las prestaciones que ofrecen son buenas más no la comisión que dan ya que quitan demasiado en impuestos y deducciones sin sentido. Lo que me molestaba bastante era el horario especial en el cual se trabajaba hasta 14 horas diarias (viernes y sábado) sin pago de tiempo.
good,"I worked for the optical department which is actually under Luxottica Retail not Sears holding. I did enjoy working for the optical dept, however I don't have a review of working for the actual Sears store itself."
good,Enjoyed my short time at Sears. Good work environment and quick paced. Management changed though and the store has since closed. I wish the best to everyone still working at a Sears.
good,"Worked in tool department. Was a fun place to work,got to interact with customers some good some bad.oversll was a good part time job to have when i needed it"
good,"On average, a lot of older people shop here. You'll learn how to use a cash register if you're new and teach about paying bills and applying for credit cards. Management really don't care about what goes on with employees, focused on keeping store clean. A lot of minors at my location so it was a lot of fun. Hardest part is when they force you to clean a whole department on your own while customers are still moving around and messing up clothes. Most enjoyable part is honestly the people you meet."
good,"Assist in placing and ordering appliances, setting up appliance services,providing customer service to other calls that may also be routed.  Great coworkers who assist in being sure that great customer service is provided and all orders are correct"
good,It is a very slow paced job looking at monitors to see if individuals are stealing items. You learn to make it through the day with good co-workers. Best part was catching thieves.
good,"Sears had there up’s and downs, but the company is going out of business. Not sure of future at this point. Management has not given us reassurance of have a job in the near future"
good,"Good training, decent tools, you are on your own and can make decent money if the leads are coming in. Management is pretty lax and focus is on production."
good,"This job helped me take care of my family, it was very flexible with my hours and was a great place to work. Management was great to work with you and help out wherever they could."
good,Great place to work just no good benefits and managers were horrible. There was also alot of favoritism that happened with the managers. If they didn't really like you you would be treated differently.
good,"como es la revisión de la mercancía, como llevar un inventario, cobro de caja y corte de ella, el registro de  mercancía de entrada y salida."
good,"Commission sales. I worked selling, ranges, OTP mircrowave ovens, dishwashers, water softeners, air conditioners, water heaters, and garbage disposers."
good,The organisation is very good and the management is also very good and supportive. Good place and nice people to work with . People are very supportive with personal feel to it.
good,"learned great customer service skills, Most people stay for the connections you make with your coworkers. Awesome place to start if you have no experience,"
good,"sears Electronics taught me a lot about customer service, public relations, the total customer experience and the importance of keeping up with the trends with changes in technological advancement."
good,"I was a sales associate and I was working my way up. I did signage in Sundays, and it was really nice that they trusted me enough to let me do it. I liked working there until they decided that I wasn't getting enough cards."
good,"The wages were terrible, the shrinkage was outrageous and stoppable, and the anager was a stubborn and mean person. However, the supervisor was great, she gave the place some light from it being so gloomy."
good,"The company was struggling, then with little warning shut down in Minot. Couldn't offer hours when it was open and closed from under a lot of folks feet. Don't apply unless you're desperate."
good,"Needs more focus on the employees that aren't associated with sales. Service/Warranty repairs are often what brings customers back, but are also often pushed back and won't be handled properly."
good,"Not the best job in the world but helps for a starter. There is a lot of issues with the company that I wish it made it perform better, but I feel as if the company gives more to the workers, Sears would be more productive."
good,Not going to participate in this as it is not a good way to get feedback and to talk about prior employement.  Thank you for the info and help and it was great.
good,"Sears was my first retail job. I learned anumber of skills on my own and I thank them for the opportunity. Sears has long been a company that has served its customers well  but a sales began to drop and vendors started leave, the culture of the company changed, Employees werw cheaed out of part of severance packages and now have to appeal to receive their pay. The way things were handled by management was not a good ending for the company. I did however learn some things that I can take with me so as I stated I am thankful for the oppurtuniy."
good,The people at Sears made every day worth it but trading conditions for a Buyer were tough.  I learnt a lot about change management and finding new ways to solve problems.
good,"we used to take care of inbound calls and try to either extend or sell a protection agreement for the appliances asking qualifying questions, addressing needs and solving problems."
good,"Team players, actively working with employees to achieve quotas, data reviews, bi monthly associate meetings, hiring, and continued training. Limited travel on associates however managers would travel to make sure customers were taken care of and that they were receiving products within timely manner."
good,I learned a lot.  I worked with a lot of good people. the bad you don't get annual reviews and raises don't happen.  going through chapter 11 bankruptcy.
good,"very overwhelmed due to short staffed, i have learned excel and power point presentations. I am determined to get our associates paid on a timely manner."
good,"great environment of staff building needed renovation. management needed new ways of operation, staff were elder an made lots of mistakes management continuously gives them a break. truckers were congested no space for live loads to sit an wait paperwork was still being scanned improperly"
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers, and helping them find products to meet their needs. The best part about Sears was the being able to do just this."
good,Sears is a great stepping stone for technicians to harness their skills. But for the amount of pay that you receive you have to put aside the low pay rate and push forward. the jobs that come through sears are very big skill builders. Nothing comes through there clean and pretty.
good,Sears wasn't an amazing place to work but it was a great place to work as a first job. The people I worked with were friendly and I enjoyed their company.
good,The commission used to pay well. Unfortunately store closures and bad media coverage led to the demise. Some managers were great while others were terrible.
good,"challenging but fun enjoyed the variety.Culture was very mixed ,sometime there was a language barrier ,but learned to communicate."
good,Fun place to work when you are first starting to work in retail. It’s sad this company isn’t doing well as they offer a lot of variety for anyone shopping.
good,"Sears a Great place to gain experience in CSR,warehouse work,mpu shipping and receiving,web fulfillment if you work in the hub..I recommend"
good,"A typical day would require, unloading of freight and working the online orders. You would be reasonable to locate and pick online orders. You are on a tight time frame for each order. Everyone works as a team."
good,"Manager turn over rate was ridiculous. I'm grateful for the opportunity that I had their the guys I worked with were amazing in the definitely helped me whenever I needed.  The shop it self was an organized the new district manager that was appointed while I was working there had no automotive experience and had a manager turnover rate that was insane I had 5 different managers within 2 years. Every time we got new managers they were never completely trained I had to help most of them re learn how to do the computer work,  Order the customers tires, teach them how to order parts and what distributors to use, what productivity was in how to keep it where was supposed to be. As a entry level Tech that should not have been my job or my responsibility."
good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno, los gerentes de ventas siempre al pendiente 2 horas para comer los cursos de capacitación divertidos"
good,Fun two months of non stop customers. Due to the time of year sometimes it was very chaotic. Manager was always available for support. All in all it was a unique experience.
good,Sears rewarded me with an opportunity for advancement and gave me the tools I need to be successful.  I am thankful to have worked for a company that rewards good performance with advancement.
good,iv worked for sears for about 3 yrs. its not a bad place to work.Thier has been some changes going on that seems to help the store. my only flaw I see in the store is that workers are under payed.
good,"Typical day at work is clocking in for my shift evening time, getting to the stock rooms to see what new clothes/trends or products are needed to be set out on the floor, cleaning up the top floor dressing rooms, assisting clients on sales floor with finding what product/apparel they are looking for, backup for the cashier when it gets busy, and cleaning up the sales floor at the end of the day before clocking out.  I learned how to assist others with finding what they need.  Management tends to change with time of people going and coming in.  The workplace culture can be fun when you get along with all your co-workers and management team members.  The hardest part of the job would be around the holidays when you have to clean up the whole store before clocking out.  Greatly enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,"The best thing about the company was the people. Other than that the work environment was awful, disorganized, unstructured and over all frustrating. Everyone was working by the seat of their pants because no one made clear and concise decisions, there was no protocol, and over all a very stressful and chaotic work environment."
good,If you like a small commission you can only receive on the last check of each month knock ya self out. Still you can grow in sears if you like being a slave
good,"10 hr shift , driving locally, in home repair, no raise for the past 4 years. I do in joy being on the road.. love to work work with tools and diagnosing repairs."
good,Sears job is fast paced doesn’t Provide much benefits but job is organized work and did involve contacting customers and making sure you made your schedule arrival time
good,L'environnement de travail était de moins en moins bonne année après année.
good,"Nice place to spent your day good work enivornment."
good,"It is unfortunate that the company of Sears Holdings is struggling.  It is a iconic company that I am sure many would hate to see close it's doors."
good,"My typical day at work was a 15 min lunch break every 4 hrs. work hard and fast till 8:15 at night from about 11 in the morning, was flexible on hours if you had to ride the bus lasted until 9:00 @ night. Check dressing rooms, fold and hang clothes in proper order by size."
good,Company insurance and company vehicle and a gas card. Unfortunately this company branch that I worked was sold and closed more than 12 years ago. It was good place to work and good management.
good,"I started taking calls from 'Shop your way' members before moving to the email team. To be honest,The did have a two week class before we moved to the floor and starting taking calls. Management could use more training, there people skills are not very good. Moral was poor there, so workplace culture was not so good. The hardest part was trying to encourage others and trying to help them be positive about themselves. The enjoyable part was some of the people that worked there."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena pero tiene un admistracion que deja mucho de que hablar como el de rec. Humanos que no escucha al personal cuando tiene un conflicto, y también contratan a gente sin experiencia en el ramo y lo tiene con jefes de áreas y no dan crecimiento laboral"
good,Taking losses because of poor management and customer service. It had sold is infrastructure to managed services. Was not sure about future of the big organisation.
good,Sears pays employees 7.25 which is not livable wage anywhere. But it’s what they pay. If you don’t mind that then it’s a reasonably good place to work.
good,"On a typical day as a consultative sales associate, I would go in and check with my coworkers on any new product, procedures, or anything new that would impact the days work. Then I would go through my checklist of daily activities, knocking them out one by one all the while assisting walking customers."
good,Le patron était souvent bête avec nous et nous parlait nous ne valons rien . Nous pouvions donner aucune suggestion pour la qualité du travail
good,j'ai apris à croire dans le produit d'entretient pour les produits de Sears.  La compagnie se tient derrière sa promesse pour un entretient préventif des produits ménager annuel.  Parcontre le client doit appeler pour céduler le rendez-vous.  S'il ne le fait pas il perd puisque l'entretient n'est pas fait.  Souvent le département des ventes rappelle au client de contacter sears pour prendre un r-vous d'entretient. malgré le peu d'avantages sociaux et le salaire j'ai aimé travailler pour Sears Canada. Je faisais des journées qui donnait des résultats avantageux pour la compagnie avec des milliers de $$$ en contrats d'entretient et en renouvellement de contrats...
good,"I do not remember much about my time working here seeing it was eight years ago. I can only remember how poorly it was managed, and since that time how the company has been failing."
good,"Good  environment, good company to work for, Management is truly engage and willing to trained you. The company want you to be success, they take time coaching and developed into employees."
good,"•	Conducted inventory and pricing discrepancy checks "
good,It was always slow at Sears if that's what you look for in a job. I learned to have a lot of patience. The hardest part of my job was cleaning up the department before closing time.
good,"It was good for flexible hours, but being commission only, it was hard not to leave or try to stay for addition sales.  Expensive benefits and sometimes conflicting management."
good,"Associates are working stressful due to the number of stores closings. When business was booming Sears was fun to work for, now you just don't know if you are next to close."
good,"Sears put a lot of stress on making credit cards. If you did not make any credit cards, then you will seem worthless. Everyone who works there is so friendly though, that is why I managed to work there for about 2 years."
good,"Employees and the manager also office personnel interacted with each other problem was in summer you always had the 40 hrs a week,but on winter time you only worked 20 to 30 hrs if you were lucky."
good,"Opening the store, setting up, assigning workers location for the day and breaks. After opening we would have a meeting every Monday to talk about new rules, goals and job well done to teams."
good,They don't advertise which ultimately makes it hard to get people in the door to make money. I was hired in November of 2016 and a few months later the company took away all associate discounts. The workplace culture however was actually a good environment. Management was there if you needed help on a task that was new to you. They offered flexible work hours that worked best for the associates.
good,"A typical day was filled with stocking, unloading trucks, loading the delivery truck, sales on the floor, I learned a bit about hardware, and other machines. Over all management was good at this establishment, the work culture was good, the customers were good too"
good,Its A GoodPlace to Work At But They Didn't last Staff seemed friendly Overall Good Place To Work At. Would Recomend People To Work Ther. Lots of nice people
good,"When i was first hired in the optical department I was very excited to learn many things about  the eye that i did not know before. My manager was very good at helping me to understand all of the information. However the hours were very few even for regular part-time standards. I'd have 28 hours one week then only 8 the next. So not good if you've got bills to pay especially if you live on your own. Some days you'd have a nonstop flow of customers, other days you'll sit there for several hours and see not a single soul. But all in all this was not the best place to work for a young adult in my opinion. the store is a dying store compared to others around it that had more customers in the same time frame of the day."
good,"Nice place, with a good workplace culture and flexible approach to management. The job was enjoyable, the lunchroom was fine, and the discount was sweet."
good,"The best part of the job is working with the people who come to shop."
good,Not a horrible place to work just very structured. Had a lot of rules and were required to make a 35% conversion on a weekly basis. Find parts quickly.
good,"Part-time job, slow pace, no future. The store is closed now and the business is in a bad situation. My manager was more preoccupied to leave his position and the company."
good,"Rushed, pushy, understaffed, over-worked. New management came in and wanted her own people with her so every chance she got, she wrote me up for ""mistakes"" or attitudes or doctor-excused absences. Life became unbearable when new manager came on board. I walked out, which I should not have done."
good,"Sears was really busy when i worked there. Good atmosphere, friendly coworkers. Some of the management was careless, many thefts took place in the short time that i was there. dont know how a buisness can survive when it is ran the way that it was ran."
good,My honest opinion of Sears as a place of work is overall a very relaxed environment for the most part. The quality of the workplace really depends on the management.
good,"Competitive environment with sub-standard pay.  Opportunity for advancement within the company, but not a considerable amount of upward mobility.  Wouldn't recommend."
good,Sears Home Improvement an informal work place and is not an ideal place for professional persons. My typical is the average call center. I enjoyed learning how the home improvements and the TV broadcasting of the Fix Upper and other home improvements shows. The difficult part of the job had been to convert calls into appointments as customers were calling in for other reasons. The enjoyable part of the had been providing professional customer service.
good,"Sears is understaffed, provides no job security and insufficient job training.  Some employees are indifferent, some are the backbone.  Managers try to be helpful, but are overworked.  A typical day is fast-paced and unpredictable.  I did learn how to use a Tellermate and print signs.  The hardest part of the job was trying to function with failing equipment.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with many of my coworkers.  The culture is friendly overall."
good,Not applicable as this store has closed all locations and there is no jobs availablenow. This job is no longer available so as an option for career there isn’t one. I enjoyed the job very much met many great people and learned a lot of great things.
good,It was fun when people actually came into the store I loved working in jewelry. I could get peope to buy watches or jewelry and i enjoyed iy very much and manager was very nice took care of any issues i had so i would recommend working here
good,"Workplace in sears is good, friendly atmosphere for the employees as well as the customers, good teamwork for team members. Managers are approachable, knowledgeable and helpful. "
good,While the local people and managers are fine but corporate has no clue. They do not listen to their managers or employees. When I started it was a good job and the tech had some control. Now it has all changed. They have turned the techs into robots with no opinions or choice in what they do.
good,"Good company to work for, great training for industry, management can be very poor depending on area, originally trained to be a technician but now the company is all about sales"
good,"Sears has given me a great career while there, they are good with promoting internally. For the most part, it is a relaxed environment to work in. I would say a good part time job but not to retire from."
good,"Job offered only one benefit, 15% shopping discount. Low pay, no advancement...poor place to work. Really, i think i listed the nothing that this job was."
good,Nice place to work.  Learn alot.  Challenged.  Good people for the most part.   Close to home.   Minimal travel.    Chance to be part of projects that may not be the case in other orgs.
good,"Job security is at none."
good,It was a cool job to have especially when it is located right across the street from my school. The people that worked there were fun and taught me more about life and the lessons that come with it
good,"Busy place all the time,I learn how to interact with the co workers and customers ,the management at over unit was excellent ,the culture was like family ,as long you do your job it will be easy"
good,"Sears was not bad place for working,  it was friendly team and management, almost every day happened something new, it was not boring, only one things was very bad - it was  freezing wage, but right now Sears closed."
good,"Lo que más me gusto es el ambiente laboral"
good,Worked with a lot of good people. was a call center learned people skills. Hardest part of job was the scheduled weekend shifts every other Saturday and every forth Sunday.
good,"For the first couple weeks of working there everything seems reasonable for the amount of they paid you. The all of a sudden I get yelled at for not achieving my goal of credit card applications per hour, which I was never told about."
good,"Nice place to work, nice people, always learning something new, management cared about the people, pay was not the best but we had perks,  I would recommend this company for employment"
good,"Although I do enjoy working there, the current company direction is frightening. Job restructures drew associates and management thin. All associates have their own metrics to meet which some are impossible to meet in Fairbanks and when they are not met we get written up."
good,I hate this job. I should have know when I had the interview this was not a good job to work at. I was told I would be full time but ended up being part time. The manager was late for the interview.
good,"I loved sears as a employee , it was very educational I consistently learned new things while I were there. From mechanics ,Customer assisting and much more. Sears parts and Repair definitely was good  employment for me."
good,"I was issued a company van so my morning started at home. When I logged onto my computer, my route for the day would load and I would travel to my first call.  I worked unsupervised to troubleshoot, diagnose, acquire parts, and make repairs to residential heating and air conditioning units and water heaters.  I traveled once a month to a district meeting several hours from my home to meet with the other technician in my district and update my training."
good,"I worked in the jewelry department at Sears. It was very slow at times, having to find things to do to keep me busy. The best time I had working for Sears was on Black Friday and at Christmas."
good,el ambiente laboral es bueno pero con compañeros por que gerencia no toma en cuenta al asesor.
good,I enjoyed my job and the responsibilities I had; however it is a dying company with multiple rounds of layoffs each year.  Not knowing if you would have a job the following month was the most stressful part.  I worked with some great people and I wish all of them the very best.
good,Depending on your job responsibility this was a fun place to work and I enjoyed my coworkers.  however I handled escalations and it was very stressful at times.
good,Sears was a great place to work until the recent cutbacks. The store has a great team prior to the cutbacks where everyone worked together to get the job done.
good,Great Place to work and great pay compared to other places. Sears is known to be one of the highest paying retail stores. I had a great time as well as life long memories while making great friends along the way.
good,I worked in the call center.  The people that I worked with were great.  I worked in an escalation department and I got tired of being yelled at all day by customers.
good,"From working with this company, it advanced my communication skill with customers and coworkers. Being able to resolve problems I was able to handle and being to pass it along to a higher management with as much information as possible."
good,At Sears it was slow. IT was only busy during Christmas time. THe customers weren't very friendly. Not a lot of work to be done. No one seemed to want to be there.
good,"Sears was a good opportunity for me to make cash while in school. Part time workers did not receive any benefits at the time I was employed, which could be different."
good,You have a huge stress of having to try and get at least ten guests to open credit with sears.Besides opening credit everything is great the people and the shifts!
good,I thoroughly enjoyed customers and coworkers.
good,This Job was temporary for me and it wasn't very busy so sometimes it was boring. The management was nice and seemed to care about the employees well being.
good,"sueldo bajo, no es un ambiente laboral muy amistoso, pero si hay posibilidades de crecimiento y buenas comisiones para los vendedores... pero no para los administrativos."
good,I only volunteered there for events and the overall atmosphere was great. the hardest part was standing for hours. enjoyable part was the activities they provided.
good,"Just a normal call center environment, I would say it is one of the better call centers to work for. Job can give you experience in some home appliances as well that can transfer to a field tech."
good,I did this job a long time ago.  The work culture was good.  The management was good at the time.  I know a lot of things have changed since then though.
good,"The pay and benefits are great, but the company has been declining for years now. The management is terrible and the job expectations are more then most people can handle on a regular 8 hour shift."
good,"Slow not really hectic and busy, learned how to be a good sales associate. Hardest part of the job is not being able to make a sale, enjoyable part of the job is making a sale."
good,It was a seasonal job with no opportunity of advancement or full time positions. I can speculate whether or not there was any room for improvement because I was only hired for the holiday season.
good,"Sears as most of you know is going down fast, no room to move up and always looking for ways to cut peoples pay. I got out when the getting out was good!"
good,Not a very fun placd to work at. Overall its managed well and the managers are ok but the work itself is slow. It could have been more better organized.
good,a typical day at sears was boring and slow. the management was very messed up and didn't stay within their departments. but besides that i enjoyed most days of trying to make sales and make lots of money based on my commission.
good,sears is like your typical retail job. Deal with customers and sell product. Discuss in morning meetings sales goals and numbers from the previous day.  Discuss game plans and opportunities amongst each department role.
good,Job placement that didn't overwork you and offered full time jobs. The prided on the management by giving them yearly bonuses and pay increases while making the lower end people work at the same wage for several years. 
good,"Walked thru the departments that I was manager over which was Apparel and Accessories. To make sure they were clean and ready for store opening, and all signage were correct and in order. I would check the sick line to see if any staff was ill. Help out on the cash, dealt with customers issues and complaints. Closed the store and cash office. Attended meetings, job performances, monitored attendance. Provided guidance to staff on up selling and what is expected of them. Interview potential employees and hired as well terminated for just cause. Followed up to make sure there was stock in the store for sales, promotions. I enjoyed the customer contact and working with the staff. if I had to terminate someone it was hard but there was a reason for them to be let go.  My fellow managers were great to work with as a team."
good,was fun for a while until new management messed it up  its a ok place to work if your fresh out of high school or still in school but i wouldn't make a career of it.
good,Sears is very slow paced especially working nights like I commonly did they don't really get a lot of business which could be good or bad there is always down time and sometimes you find yourself with nothing to do because all the work is already done.
good,"I really like the job at Kmart but they wasn't able to change my position as a cashier and they didn't give me a lot of hours. The store manager was really intimidating and always want perfection in everything you do, even though there is a certain job that you haven't learned yet he expects you to know it already."
good,Nothing much left as environment is very weak and always has salary issue.no resolution to issue we send to mangement.policy changes within every 3 months no job security
good,"Sears was a good place to work at first. All the employees where I worked were on commission.  When they hired more associates to work the floor, it created conflict and friction.  It made it impossible for anyone to make any money with so many salespeople on the floor."
good,"I loved the job I was doing,but my hours were cut to ten per week and this was not enough to do a great job.I worked for Sears service in Atlanta Georgia for over thirty years and that was a wonderful job.Wonderful employees ."
good,Very good job if your willing to work 6 days a week with excellent pay!! With Sears Canada going out of business it has slowed down a lot and may close. The person I work for has been a franchisee of Sears in carpet and upholstery cleaning since 1994.
good,Sears was a fun place to work.  I started working in stocking and selling paint and hardware.  This was fun and simple but heavy work moving around paint cartons constantly.  I then was offered the position of Maintenance Tech. when the current Tech. walked off the company.  This was more of a challenge but not terribly difficult.  I kept that position until I found a position with Telex Communications which was more in line with my chosen career.
good,"I worked at Sears as part of the receiving team. This entailed lots of heavy lifting in a fast-paced environment. The downside to working in the back as a part time worker was that there were little to no benefits or health insurance options if you were injured on the job."
good,"Very  stressful."
good,"I loved sales, but the responsibilites and expectations of being a manager were more than I wanted to live with."
good,Sears when I worked there looked as if they were going to close in the nineties. They really didn't have the customers show up when the store was opened but they still stayed in business.
good,"Gave you a lot of hours, but would not haggle the hours. Said they could work with your schedule, but turned around and said nope the hours you gave me you cannot change them."
good,Un endroit agréable pour travailler et possibilité d'apprendre plusieurs tâches si nous sommes polyvalent.
good,"Invisible management but good place to learn. Need some more opportunities for self-growth. The company has rich heritage and has good work-ethics. However, insecurity and management is a concern."
good,While I was straight commission my biggest competitor was within my own company.. Was not always like that. I would loose commission price matching my own company.went through all types of Mgrs. like water
good,"I was hired as a Data Scientist and was put in Software Development team. I worked with technologies like Spring Boot, Oracle etc. The company is not doing great now and they don't hire interns if you're not a data scientist."
good,Es una empresa en la cual laboras mas de tus horas. Tienes hora de entrada mas no de salida el salario es muy poco.
good,"120% turnover rate."
good,"For the most Part, I felt that the management of the overall store was lacking the knowledge and drive to lead a team. The employees on a whole didn't seem to care much for their jobs,"
good,"Was treated well.  Manager worked well with everyone, and was understanding of the team members that worked for the military and was as flexible as he could be with scheduling issues.  Enjoyed the group I worked with but the building was in need of repair and updating."
good,"En cuanto a gerencia esta siempre se encuentra muy abierta para poder platicar sobre el ambiente del trabajo y la forma en que los compañeros te tratan. Es tedioso en la forma de que los compañeros con antigüedad te ven como un rival de ventas en vez de un compañero y tu vida privada deja de serlo un poco ya que siempre escucharas chismes de entre los mismos compañeros y olvídate de querer simpatizar un poco mas con alguno de ellos porque los chismes de noviazgo recaerán mas sobre ti. En cuanto a la paga, mientras seas de turno completo si veras una gran quincena, y mas si tienes comisiones más sueldo base, pero si no lo eres tendrás que esforzarte mucho mas para que tu quincena logre cubrir todos tus gastos. no hay un verdadero equilibrio entre sueldo-calidad de ambiente/trabajo y vida propia."
good,"Although it was a slow paced environment, the management did not know what they were doing. All of sears & Kmart are closing down and they are pretty strict for their pay. they have not given raises in 7 years"
good,"Not a bad company to work in. "
good,A fun place to work for years diagnosing and repairing home appliances and heating and cooling systems. Changing to a sales type job. If you are a salesperson it would be a good job.
good,"Days can be high stress, Meet good customers, but company demands 1000% of each person. Not enough time in the day to get all work done, and tough to advance unless you take a job they want you at far away from where you live, just to fill a hole or missing spot. Good employees and nice people, just wish CEO and upper management would help move things forward and not stay the same."
good,"Es una empresa donde puedes quedarte a trabajar, no solo de temporada, da buenos beneficios para trabajadores leales, lo mas dificil es quedarse cuando hay venta nocturnas."
good,"Great people totally committed to their role, the company and the well being of the company work here. Many Senior leaders with out much time or commitment to the company allowed to make decisions on job eliminations not in the best interest of the company."
good,A fast paced work environment. The management isn't the greatest but isn't the worst.The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers.The hardest part was loading trucks.
good,Great thing is you aren’t stuck doing one thing. Sometimes you’re answering calls. Sometimes you’re lifting mowers out of a truck. Sometimes you’re delivering a washer and dryer.
good,"At the time I worked for Sears, it was declining rapidly.  Incentives and benefits were being taken from employees at a fast rate."
good,"Sears is sometimes willing to work with associates, but usually it's not. Direct managers can be great, however there is a LOT of favoritism throughout upper management. If you need a job, it's not bad, but it is pretty stressful so be aware."
good,"I love to work at sears with my co-workers have a chill day at work,help one another with what is it. Solve every problems in a group like family. the hardest things is that my manager he doesn't give me hours to work . I have learned how to create credit card. I love to take break with my friends that's when I enjoy a lot  ."
good,"All in all it was a good company to work for. I was a salesman for exterior products such as doors and windows."
good,Sears was a great place to work. I was a dock hand but got to do many things while i was there. The only problem was the company is going down hill and there weren't many chances to advance.
good,"Sears gave me opportunities to grow my career and I will always be thankful for that. There were always too may changes. As soon as a new person took over an upper management position, instead of researching what Policy and Procedures were in place at the time, they wanted to change everything to make it their own and this wasted a lot of time and money because they didn't understand the full scope."
good,It was a great work place I would definitely go back to this.  I would love to work for this company butbitvhas shut down............................ I really can say a lot but I really had to go and try to find another place of employment
good,Pressure associates to get certain amount of credit card applications and maintain certain amount of numbers based on how many people enter their phone number. Which determine their hours. Stores are busted.
good,"Sears is an old model of a once thriving corporation. I was in sales and while the work itself was fine, the work was scarce. Hardly anyone came into our store so meeting sales goals was nearly impossible. Additionally, they paid us less than minimum wage and we had to make the difference in commission. If we weren't able to make minimum wage, they would supplement our hourly rate but then dock the following paycheck that had a surplus. Our store manager was terrible but my department managers were great in all three departments I worked in. I learned a ton of people skills and gained a huge respect for people working in retail. The hardest part was waiting for a customer, sometimes for hours, while being required to stay on your feet and alert. The most enjoyable part was when someone bought a ton of attachments and boosted our commission rate."
good,Typically fun at the beginning of my career . Days are usually moderate to busy. Customer service experience was both rewarding and challenging. The best part of my day was learning something new to share with my team and satisfying the customer . The worst part of my job was company downsizing.
good,they were very helpful and courteous. willing to help in way  possible. the backroom was very team oriented. the floor was patient with the back room associates.
good,Sears has become synonymous with a declining business model for a long time. They never recovered from the loss of prestige that they incurred by incorporating themselves with Kmart.
good,"I am a first year university student and I could not tell you how many times they booked me in for shifts while I would be in school. While I had only worked in the company for 1 year I had 3 managers in that time period. It was frustrating because I could only work 10-15 hours a week and they would make me work 30 or so instead which did cause complications with my exams. Though I did like my co workers a lot, the management was a little all over the place."
good,if you need an part time when in high school/college this is a great place.  the pay is good for what you have to do and you get PTO and benefits.  Also a great job for the retired.
good,Sears is a pretty good company to work with the people who are employed are very amazing people. Needs better management or more staffing so management are able to preform how they're suppose to
good,"Es un buen trabajo siempre y cuando vendas mucho, de lo contrario va a ser poco lo que veas en tu nómina. Son muchas horas de trabajo incluso en fines de semana y un día de descanso a la semana"
good,"I had a great experience training and coaching associates.  I mentored many people in the retail industry that got there start working for me.  It is always rewarding to see people move on and do well."
good,A typical day at work was sometimes good and sometimes not so much depending on who I worked with but overall I had a great crew I worked with and we made our shift fun. Even though sometimes we would get rude customers there were always those customers who made our day worth while. Our manager and assistant managers at our Kmart store always rolled up their sleeves and helped with freight and made sure the store looked neat and clean. Pretty much all the co-workers got along well and we helped each other out. Hardest part of the job is that we didn't get paid what we were all worth!
good,I was a sales agent in the Electronics department.  Comissions started out competitive and then shrank as the company tried to right the retail ship.  This has not been successful.  If Sears can turn around their retail slide it would be a place I would recommend.
good,"The job i did was customer escalations resolution. I t was stressful and they did not provide us with a whole lot of stress relief, but we did have a lot of stress"
good,great place for high school and university students.  only 3 shifts required per week (min 12 hours). flexible shifts to assist with schedules. fair pay at min wage.
good,"Good starting point for new / green engineers.  Not much advancement potential for seasoned engineers.  Good work life balance and bonus structure.  Family owned, don't have to mess with corporate red tape."
good,"Most managers are very good there, easy to work with on scheduling. Most days I go in and clean up the mismatch shelf, that people just put the random shoes they find on. Also work every Sunday to put the ad up. I enjoy the people I work with, everyone is very friendly. I do reports for inventory purpose, to make sure we have the shoes that inventory says we do. This is done with a hand held and a computer to zero out product if needed."
good,Good college or start off job and flexibility hours not very consistent and hard to move up in work field co workers were great busy environment so helped make time fly by
good,"Over the years I have learned many things.  However, of late it"
good,Get to work on time attend customers needs try to get them to sign up for the rewards program and also apply for a credit card if your metrics are bad you get low hours
good,Doesn't pay enough for as much work has to be done. Overall a good job for someone who absolutely needs money. Should have better managers. There is nothing to do in the store you can't sit.
good,"Workload per week was stressful. Not enough help during peak hours, and low wages. Store culture was fun and management was nice. Associates and customers were friendly"
good,"This company once flew atop the highest of the corporation flagships but has been unraveling for some time now. This causes everyone to have a sort of ""cloud"" lingering over all the employed's heads with nobody knowing when their job will be curtailed. This causes everyone to force a fake smile and follow a work culture that is desperate to kiss the feets of any and all customers. While I did enjoy my time working for this company, I am glad that the inevitable pink slip will not be received by me from this company."
good,"Good work environment, management. I learned team work, cooperation and patience from my job. I find this job quite interesting. The most enjoyable part of this job is we always work in team. Thanks."
good,very unstable place to work you never know when the store or are is going to be closed or your position is eliminated. people that work there are cut trought because they don't know when they are going to be let go
good,"I enjoyed working in the position I was in. However, having to deal with a store manager that had no problem with cursing at his employees was unacceptable."
good,"Sears can be very corporate-minded and they are a bottom-line company. While I enjoyed my co-workers, some of the managers didn't distribute the workload evenly and were more interested in socializing than leading."
good,"Easy job, flexible hours, but no set schedule. I worked in the backroom and was left alone most of the time, although there was some team work involving unloading trucks."
good,"Not enough hour. no pay raises, no benefits. Do others jobs on top of my own I do not receive any perks, or benefits from it min. pay rate. I have learned a lot from this job I am very grateful for that."
good,"I learned a great deal about handling customer calls and dealing with trouble from the Team Leaders. I perfected the ability to handle calls and to deal with upset customers. The base pay was only fair, but bonuses for setting appointments that sold products helped a great deal, at least in the first two years."
good,"Sears was a fun workplace with lots of giveaways and raffles on a daily basis , it was very professional and the environment was fast paced and there are televisions in every room of the building ."
good,Day to day operation was quite chaotic and also appeared to be retrofitting where we were into where we needed to be from a strategy point of view.  I was with the company during a period of extreme change which offered great opportunity but at the cost of my personal life.  Ended up going highly unappreciated but I wish them all the best.
good,I would print and sort sale signs.  Walk around the floor and make sure they were updated with proper dates and times.  Display the sales that were for bonus times.
good,"Team members were very polite and friendly, was very competitive since it was commission based, Manager told me it was a full position and not seasonal, but then suddenly the position changed and team members were let go."
good,I personally felt like there was a lot of favoritism shown by some of the management but otherwise the management and employees there were nice and it was like we were a family at the store I worked at. I did enjoy working there for the most part but I didn't like that there was no room for advancement in the company and there really wasn't any incentive to continue working there.
good,Depending on your skill level you can do anything from oil changes to brakes. the more you learn the more you can earn. Pay is based on commission for upper level techs.
good,I was working here for in sears over 6 years. I was very honest with my work and very friendly with every one. very hardest part of the job is store manager Rae is very loud and my office is right next to her's. Learned lot about in this job at the end manger let me do the payroll. Management could've been more better since lately lack of employees it was very hard to keep it up.
good,"Poor Management, Rude employees. All employees had attitudes with not only the customers but the rest of the other staff. People were lazy and left the store a mess."
good,"This was unhealthy environment for first time experience. I definitely have cam eto the conclusion, if you have to work somewhere, please work somewhere that has great structure and great quality with the culture of the company"
good,"A typical day at work, for me, would usually involve standing at the register, asking the occasional member ""How are you doing, today?"", ""Finding everything alright?"", ""Is there anything in particular you're looking for today?"", to which the answer would usually be ""Just looking."" "
good,"The job is very easy but there isn't any opportunity to move up in the company. Things aren't consistent and there is always a new policy that come out. We have to learn things as we go, not saying that is a problem but sometimes it would be nice to know before it gets thrown at us. I have learned how to deescalate customer and help them out as much as I can! Every manager is different in both good and bad ways. Either they don't seem like want to help when help is needed or when things get tough thy go above and beyond or you!"
good,"I'd clock in, get to work. Which entails restocking the floor and organizing the stockroom and cleaning work area. Coworkers were great people that I enjoyed to work with. The managers would change every month or two, managers would constantly quit. The store I had worked at had got multiple new store managers within a couple of years. I eventually sought other jobs and left the place because of the new store manager. A lot of department managers did this as well and the store never really had consistent management."
good,"It was fun to work here, but the credit was pushed WAY too much for the amount that was given back to the employees.  Raises were nonexistent which made the employees feel like they were unappreciated. Hours weren't that flexible."
good,"Besides the fact that i was antagonized by one of my managers, it was a great work place with a ton of kind and friendly faces. I was taught a great amount working with this company."
good,Enjoy the money that can be made and the learning just feels Sears needs to be more apt to give there employees more. They treat sales people as a person easily replaced so they have a big turn over rate
good,"On the good side:"
good,It was a great experience working there the culture is amazing and very team oriented. The down side is the job security with the economy is very low. there is also no room for advancement because there are only two managers and two leads that's it and the rest pay relatively the same unless your a sales consultative.
good,"Female in a male driven industry in rural Alabama came with a few hurdles. I worked to provide repair parts and service to Sears product customers. My overall management was from the executive office in Schaumburg, IL.  Overall, had autonomy to manage the unit based on the geographic need. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the racial and gender discrimination. The most enjoyable part of the job was earning the respect of my technicians and support team."
good,Low hours and  tough customers. Pressure to sell and pressure to get credit applications. Must know your items in order to upsell or sell the protection agreements.
good,enjoyed my working experience with the team that i had we always had a very fast paced enviorment that always kept us on our toes and made the work day go by alot faster
good,"I worked just a few hours a day selling appliances, it was slow at times but a great selling experience. I had to study the products in order to answer the customers questions."
good,I enjoyed people i worked with. I didn't really think management was anything special and though i could of done better job with no experience in it. Overall it was still fun but not a career job.
good,"Sears is in the retail business.  Retail stores are struggling badly due to the online market,  Sears Holdings company owns Sears stores and Kmart stores.  With diminishing business at the various Sears and Kmart stores, stores keep having to be closed down which leads to staff cuts at the headquarters complex."
good,"In this role, I am able to train and develop talent daily. "
good,"The typical day at work was fun, on top of working I meet a lot of new people and got a best friend from working there. There I learn a lot on how a clothes warehouse run. The management was really nice. In my opinion there was no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of this job or any job is getting off and pay day."
good,"Sears is a tough place to work, especially for middle management. At every monthly meeting you must explain to a group of hard working service technicians that you are taking something else away. It got to a point for me personally that I could no longer look at myself in the mirror and continue to lead the individuals that worked for me down a path that showed no positive end. I worked with Sears over twenty years and watched it go from a family friendly team environment to one that was only concerned with profit, not employees. The employee burnout rate was way too high and it was sad to see. This is what happens when a hedge fund manager who knows nothing about the retail industry merges two fairly run companies and gets rid of the management only to take over himself and make a real mess of things. Sears probably will not be around long and I've been gone for about thirteen years, so I can imagine what employees must endure there. It's a very sad thing to watch a once great company die a slow painful death mostly due to inept management."
good,Support from peers is excellent from manager thru leads.  Company is closing stores and the stress of not knowing if your store is next is affecting employees work attitudes.
good,They gave me a chance when no one would.  I have enjoyed my job there and would recommend it to someone else.  They work with your time off requirement.
good,"In the ever changing retail world, SHC is a challenging place to work lately.  In my 18+ years with the company I have seen a lot of change and learned to adjust to the changes.  Management has always seemed to be open and honest and strive to maintain an enthusiastic work environment.  The hardest part is truly understanding the future of the company.  In the end, it's the people that work here that make this a great place to work."
good,"Sears is supposed to be a great company, but they base your hours that you work on if you can get credit applications. Also they have you apply people illegally messing up their credit in the long run."
good,The upper bosses does not want to hear from the little ppl at all. They kinda suck cause they always look for a way to get rid of us and go all internet.
good,"Sears was a good company to work for "
good,"Job can be pretty boring and slow. Sometimes theirs nothing to do, or a ton to do. Women's clothes is always trashed no matter what. The employees in the Men's sections almost always have to help out cleaning the Women's section."
good,"Hard to make commission without customers."
good,"Productive great learning experience,had a chance to meet a lot of great people .A lot of good sales training Customer experience enjoyed speaking to the different customer never new what or who you were going to talk to next on the phone a nice customer or a customer that was very upset being able to over come objections calming the customer down and making the biggest sale of the day.Very stressful days but a lot of good people to get you through it having a very supportive supervisors had a chance to work with technicians while thay were in the customers home on what to do with broken appliances and selling agreements for the technicians"
good,I enjoyed working for Sears but I wish they were a little more understanding because things happen in people lives that they have no control over.  The pay was ok and the employees was wonderful to work with.  I'm glad I had a chance to meet everyone that I worked with and I wish them all the best.
good,Sears is an OK place to work. There are mostly young people (high school to college age) working there. It is very clickish. The pay is not great. The work atmosphere is low morale since Sears is not doing very well.
good,Have not worked there for a few years but started as seasonal help and was asked to stay on as part time (2nd job). It was a standard cashier position.
good,Ambiente nocivo de trab pocas oportunidades de ascenso solo son dados no x antiguedad si no por recomendacion no reconocen tu trabajo y auedos insuficientes mal apoyo por parte de recursos humanos falta de motivacion y poco apoyo en general
good,"I worked there because I needed money to help pay for my education at Millersville University.  I learned how to organize shelves, logistics of store planning, customer relations, and how to handle stress while being professional.  The management care about the store and want their employees to do well.  The workplace culture was okay,"
good,Company continues to cut positions due to sales. Typical day of work consisted of traveling to one of 13 stores within a 3 hour radius of my home. Hardest part of the job was having to continually release quality employees yearly for job reductions.
good,"A typical day at work consist of checking out IPAD for p.o.s. transactions, assisting customer needs in selection of household appliances. I learned how intricate and detailed the world of appliances is. The store managers were excellent, the department managers were hostile and hard to get along with. The culture of the workplace was pretty depressing, and always had the feeling of panic. The hardest part of the job, being the youngest and newest sales associate, was gaining enough product knowledge to build customer trust. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i finally gained enough knowledge to confidently answer any question a customer could ask."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a store meeting before the beginning of each shift to review expectations for the day, and  I learned the importance of organization from employees as well as leadership figures. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I had the liberty to fulfill tasks independently, without having to be told, in a repetitive manner, explicitly all the tasks that had to be fulfilled in that day."
good,"8 hour days, rotating weekends.  Able to leave work at work.  Management supportive but most were not field technicians so education was limited to ""book learning"" and not actual experience with working on appliances so it was sometimes difficult for them to give advice or support.   Hardest part of the job was constant policy/procedure changes. Job security very low due to company lack of stability and many lay offs.  Most enjoyable part was working with great coworkers, teamwork, providing excellent support to field technicians.  Pay fairly good but not competitive with other tech support salaries. Good pay with overtime."
good,"Good first job, basic retail skills. Very slow work pace, not many people visit the store. Management was immature. The hardest part was standing in one place for 8 hours with 1 or 2 customers per shift."
good,"•	Consistently provide a sense of urgency to maintain standards while obtaining associate."
good,I used to thoroughly enjoy going into work but some things have changed and I find it difficult to come into a work environment where your voice is overpowered by the favored employees and there is no room to grow in the company itself.
good,I really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at Sears but the rate of pay wasn't worth the difficulty of the labor.I would recommend this job to a Jr/Sr High School student.
good,"Depending on your position its very hard to advance here. Some mangers are hired from other companies and do not know how to do the job effectively which effects others trying to do their job. The culture is good. Lot of people are friendly towards each other. people tend to stick with their own status: ex: cashier with cashiers, stockers with stockers. Everyone tends to blame each other instead of working together as a team. Also, huge hour cuts recently."
good,"Difficult for advancement in a dying company. The company would fire people who had been there for years. Overall the stores have a high turnover rate, and you get fired if you don't learn everything. I have worked there for multiple years now and have done everything from training to freight, add set in soft lines and hardlines to being a service desk employee."
good,"Working at Sears was hard but not impossible. There were a lot technical difficulties with the cash registers during the holidays, but there were ways that we were able to calm the customers."
good,"I worked 40 hours a week, found myself in a rut, any was trying to support my family on a meager salary, management was fair and the people were all very fair and nice, it was time to move on"
good,"Sears was a great place to work at when I first started.  But, over the years the company started taking away employee incentives, and everyone's moral lowered.  I truly enjoyed my time at Sears, but it was time for change."
good,"It was your basic minimum wage job, lifting, sorting, and stocking various items in the warehouse off the truck.  Hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, best part, lax lunch breaks; managers weren't taskmasters"
good,Que su salario sea mayor ya que es una empresa grande
good,"I was moved over to a complete commissioned position during a very slow time of year so I was making less money than in the ""lesser"" position. I enjoy the people I work with though."
good,"Workday was somewhat mundane.  I learned about product so that I could sell and make money. I was a commissioned sales person."
good,this was a job to make the ends meet but there was nothing to do for fun when on breaks. Sears is a place that wanted perfection and the only way to get a head in this company was kiss the boss butt.
good,"En la empresa he podido aprender a ejercer muchas tareas a la vez,  y siempre doy lo mejor de mi, tanto a mis compañeros como al cliente, he aprendido a dar un servicio de excelencia y a usar los recuses de la compañía como computadora, cajas registradoras y he podido ir a training para capacitarme cada día mas."
good,"I liked the job but the store went out of business, so I didn't get to experience too much."
good,I enjoyed waiting on customers and finding them just the right piece of jewelry they were looking for.  Love see and dealing with people on a regular basis.
good,"I was supervisor of kids, lingerie, and the home department. It was a ton of information to take in and not enough to training for it, you basically had to learn most of it yourself. Time management was a key element I learned at this job."
good,"Typical day at work is pretty mellow, depending on the type of customers you work with. "
good,"I worked in the Pleasanton store and only lasted a few months. The store manager expected much more from our sales, but there were no customers to attend to.  Co-workers we great and supportive, and location was great."
good,Sears has a very good mentorship and development programs that held individuals grow their careers.  Work days are fast paced with many measurable to achieve.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the many people you get to work with that are committed to performing at high levels.
good,"I enjoyed the work "
good,El trato d los empleados en ocasiones es muy hostil... En ocasiones no hay buen ambiente laboral x parte de los compañeros
good,typical work day is 8- 10 hours. learned a lot from this position and got my foot in the door to the industry. management at the time was tough to work with. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer.
good,"During the months of November to January a lot of work, after that its dead, and a minute feels like an hour. Since commission is on credit cards no customers means no commission. Great co-workers though!"
good,"The hours fluctuated from 8-40 a week. "
good,"Fast paced. I learned how to work an RMU,do RTSs, work a fork lift, Make product layouts in a timely manner, how to process online orders. Management was friendly and efficient. No hard part of job, unless it was black Friday week but that is always busy no matter where you work retail however, it was fairly easy. I enjoyed meeting new people and how fast paced the actual job was."
good,"Great work environment, little room for advancement, enjoyed sales quotas and the culture. Great training program, enjoyed learning different methods on how to sale appropriately."
good,"Working at Sears is not for the light-hearted. They are going through a monster transformation and many people do not seem to know how to get there. Expect to work in a fast-paced, sink-or-swim atmosphere filled with a mix of new talent, old mindsets, and a case study in the Peter Principle."
good,"First priority is to answer incoming calls, be courteous, to assist the technician/customer  in the  field  to isolate and resolve the issues the customer is having with their product by using computer information on intranet/internet /files to find answers. Attend training classes from manufacture trainers  when available. Use the available time between calls to learn  the  products to be serviced. Help fellow co-workers when asked for assist"
good,A typical day at work at sears involves a lot of customer service and making them fell welcomed. I learned a lot about cashier and handling money. The work place is semi chilled and management is respectful.
good,Sears was a good job but it did not allow me to balance my work and life (my son) When illwas ill it was difficult to get the time i needed for sudden illness.
good,"working at sears was find, just like working at any other retail shop. I worked at a sears in a mall but it was slow pasted had very few customers"
good,It's a great place to learn a lot of the basics and a bit more. Most people you work with are willing to teach you and help you.
good,Tiene ambiente de trabajo es exigente no hay problema con eso lo unico es que no tienes nada de vida social
good,this was one of my first jobs as a teen and it was a good experience. Got my feet wet into an industry that pays well if you know the right people to guide you up the latter
good,Room to advance and better yourself as an employee. Good management creates peaceful work place. Co-workers are always helpful.
good,"Stayed for two years, year one as a cashier and the second year a home improvement sales. The home improvement job is nice to have when you work pretty much full time hours, but it has a lot of downfall at times."
good,"My year at Sears as a part-time electronics sales associate was a relatively easy job for me. The days usually went by slow with the lack of business, but I would always make the most of it. I was the one of the most reliable part-time associates in the store for all departments. I would often assist managers or other departments for various things. Whether that would be resetting the floor, building items that needed to go on the floor , helping transactions outside of my department, or just helping move stuff around. The hardest part of the job was just learning the system. That included how to do things such as returns, layaway, leasing, Sears credit cards, and simple transactions. Once I learned all of that about 3 weeks into the job, it was a breeze the rest of the way. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the environment. I got along with all of my managers and co-workers, so it made my days easier and more enjoyable."
good,"While I didn't mind the commission pay, I think the overall pay out could have been better. I would actually prefer a steady paying job. The management didn't really provide the best training. We watched a few videos and took some test and then were sent out into the field. Benefits were ok."
good,The hardest part about this job was keeping with all the clothes that needed to put out on a weekly basics. Most of the people that worked there were pretty easy to get along with.
good,Hardest part would be having to call customers to reschedule.  Only hard when the customer is upset and we really have no other options.  Daily work with techs on the road and set calls for routes for the week.
good,I was a younger man working here as a loss prevention detective. I enjoyed working there and keeping everything in lined with the store to make sure we were not having any losses. The only downside to this job was the pay. I felt as though the pay could have been more considering the risk and situations we had to deal with daily in our job duties as a loss prevention detective.
good,"This was a good job for me to advance and grow off of the phones into the industry I am in now.  If you are looking for a life career this is probably not the place for you, but it is a good start. Although I have moved on, I am thankful for my opportunity with this company."
good,I have worked for the company for almost 4 years. It is an okay work environment with an opportunity to make good commissions on sales. Management is friendly and were willing to work with my part time schedule while I completed school.
good,It was usually very slow when I worked because I am currently in school. But they were more than willing to work around my school schedule which was exactly what I was looking for.
good,"sold perfume everyday, had to make qutoa, set up new fragrances the hardest part of the job was the rude customers the most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers"
good,"overall good place to work, lots of fun and experience learned working in retail. Management always fare and good working with. Flexible lunch breaks."
good,I work in the Lands End section and I enjoy it very much. I have learned how to work with cash registers and floor planograms. Provide customer service and solving customer problems.
good,"Overall Sears is a decent place to work.  It takes flexibility and adjustment. However, the compensation and benefits are very poor considering the amount of work involved."
good,"Manque d'enthousiasme et de motivation du personnel dû à de nombreux changements dans la politique commerciale de l'entreprise."
good,"The managers were always helpful and involved in the day to day running of the store. I felt they did the best they could with what they had. Hours would go from 50 a week to 4, depending on time of year. It was hard to depend on that job, which is why I ultimately ended up leaving. It is good for students or a single person just looking for extra cash."
good,"horarios muy extensos que cuando no eres vendedor no tienes ningun ingreso extra, sueldo regular"
good,"trop de changement de stratégies pour un personnel ancien qui n'y croyait plus."
good,I love being on my feet and moving around to complete my tasks for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is having different conversations with my coworkers.
good,"percentage of compensation for sales is virtually nothing and there are really no benefits. the managers and co workers are great, upper management doesnt compensate workers enough to keep working here."
good,"The responsibilities I had in inspecting trucks and writing claims was fullfilling. Having such responsibilities in one of the lowest ranking warehouses nationwide was not. Internal theft, insubordination and poor management made it impossible for anyone to succeed within the warehouse."
good,"- Service à la clientèle "
good,appointment are far apart. cape may to elizabeth. pay is good when you can sit an appointment and sell. but you could drive 2 hours and have a no show
good,"I was in charge of the parts and service for Edmonton and area. I had to deal with 7 employees and over 2,000 parts not including the parts that were on hold or on order. Had to keep the place clean for the customers and a kind and friendly attitude towards the customers. As it was the parts and service most customers came in because something they bought from sears broke and it was part of my job to make sure that they got there parts ordered and deal with any complaint. There was normal at leas one angry person a day and it was part of my job to calm them down. was a vary stressful job around the holidays."
good,Good start but need to branch of. Management is alright depends on how you work honestly. Mall is close so lunch isn't a problem getting. Traveling is not so bad lots of transportation near
good,"Good foundation for using managerial skills: Customer Service, P/L,   issue resolution, team work,  etc.  No two days are the same."
good,"The sears I worked for was somewhat understaffed, but the staff itself was fun to work with. My role at the store was stocking, ad set-up and takedown, cashiering, and selling credit cards. The card pushing was the only major downside to the job."
good,"I have worked in Loss Prevention, Electronics, Appliances and now the Jewelry Lead. I have had the opportunity to advance with this company and have been promoted to Jewelry Lead since Feb 2016."
good,"Sears is a company in flux.  There are lots of changes happening and it can sometimes create confusion, but no more than any other national chain store that is re-branding itself. The mall is a nice place to work.  Free parking, food court, a/c, hours of operation...all positives for me."
good,"Good environment and management. Bad compensation. The company as a whole is failing though so not very secure. My coworkers were very friendly however. Also training on the computers was next to useless, and there was little training outside of that"
good,When I first was hired I was told that I would get 8.50 a hour and I did not even get my pay check until 2 months later because they did not did not do there stuff right and I told the store manager that I was told I was going to get 8.50 a hour and when I get paid I found out everybody gets paid 7.25 hours unless you are a manager so I quit I cant afford to got to work 60 miles a day 7.25 a hours working only 14 hours a week the only good thing about this job is everybody gets along there is no drama
good,"a typical day at work is assisting customers with their purchases and "
good,"Sears is a good start for any mechanic. They allow you to learn the bare minimum of the shop environment. You receive a small amount of commission on the jobs you do, and quite honestly, you'll work harder than the pay you get, if you're really good at what you do."
good,"Great place to work with fun people. I worked in the Jewelry Department, so I was mostly by myself. I did however enjoy helping the customers."
good,Great people to work with but the company has no vision and a lack of brand direction. A lot of long hours as a Design Director.
good,"I had the best training in my immediate supervisor, as well as the General Manager. I learned and achieved a lot during my tenure. The only downfall was the communication between myself and management. I was not allowed to be myself and grow with the company. There was a ""my way or the highway"" mentality in the office."
good,"A typical day at work would be putting clothes out in their respective places, cleaning out the dressing rooms, putting clothes back on racks from the dressing rooms, maintaining a neat and clean environment throughout my section and helping members order online items when needed."
good,"mise en place des nouveautés en électronique,"
good,"I manage the planning, organizing and implementation of a large complex internal highly visible initiative crossing multiple disciplines and businesses. I work with constituent managers to monitor cost, schedule, and technical performance of component projects and operations, while working to ensure the ultimate success of the program. Responsible for determining and coordinating the sharing of resources among their constituent projects to the overall benefit of the program. Steering Committee and regular program team status meetings and all other communications. All team members within the program take direction from the manager for the duration of the project. Accountable for the overall management and delivery of the program on behalf of business, operations and IT."
good,Sears Corporation is slowly dying because of it's terrible service. I did however enjoy the shop your way rewards program.
good,"My typical day at work involves three major duties including Merchandise Pick-Up (mpu), Web Orders and UPS shipments. Majority of the time I spend working would primarily include moving around the store, picking up items ordered online and occasionally returning to mpu to help customers with their merchandise. Finishing the day by cleaning and packing any online orders that need to be shipped."
good,"flexible hours, constantly communicating and helping customers. Learned sales methods and techniques. High expectations, much help and advice given from management. Not much room for growth/increase in pay."
good,"Facilities are closing and multiple layoffs. More are coming soon. Business is slow."
good,At store level people are great. There is no such thing as a typical day as every day is different. You are not restricted to the assigned area of supervision as you can be called upon for help in any area of the store. This unfortunately takes you away from what you are supposed to be doing. Most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference for the customer that really needed the help. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the customer that tries to bully their way to what they want.
good,Management was good but the environment was not as expected due to slow traffic in the store...when I was working hours were cut and the company was losing money.
good,Okay place to work at. Not very professional company. Favor some employees more than others. Just isn't the best company.
good,Travail créatif mais physiquement exigent avec aucune chance de hausse de salaire.
good,learned good sales techniques and time management. also gained a lot of product knowledge and industry knowledge that may be helpful later on
good,"My time at Sears so far has been, for lack of a better word, doable.  The work is fairly easy and my department manager is pretty fair in terms of distributing responsibilities and scheduling accommodations, however there's room for quite a few improvements in the upper management area."
good,"I have learned a lot of people skills and been introduced to nice individuals. It is slower during the weekdays, but during the weekends it is pretty busy. The holidays are the busiest time."
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, thes Texarkana store has a lot of things that need to be improved. The management there is poor, the store manager never really seems to know what is going on, while other manger(s) are unprofessional and also rude to not only associates but to customers as well. Working your butt of for $7.25 was NOT worth doing multiple jobs at once just so you won't get into trouble. Sears employees are supposed to work as a team, but some employees walk over others and stray off to do anything other than the job they applied for."
good,"I worked there for a few months and got very comfortable with my co-workers after about a month or so. They're all very helpful and welcoming. BUT the customers we attract can be awful, 60% seems like an honest amount. And they have a serious issue with their computer systems, at least once a week my register would shut down in the middle of a transaction. Mixing that with unruly customers would make anyone want to quit. They tend to give you busy work because they're really only busy when it's a holiday or Saturday."
good,"Really cool, relaxed environment. There was some people that I still keep in touch with since I left the company. This was a part time job for a short period of time."
good,"We have seen better financial times and after almost 22 years with Sears it may be time for a new career.  Job Security is very important and benefits.  are a definite plus, but also I find working in a fun job is just as important."
good,Sears is a nice workplace and a great place for customers to come get what they want or need with no problem. Managers wasn't always on their job. They didn't give the hours I needed.
good,"I enjoyed working with all the different people at Sears especially"
good,"This is a good place for people looking for a part time job. If you're not, seriously don't bother. Full time positions and advancements are hard to come by and often not worth it."
good,"Great culture within AP/LP, but other management departments lost focus about what was really important, like great customer service."
good,"Daily review and investigate of cash shortages, register activity reports.  Audits of incoming and outgoing shipments. Detect and apprehend external theft.  Coach staff and store employees on theft related incidents  and safety."
good,"The job was not something everyone can do or tolerate"
good,Not a very hard job at all. Hardest part is meeting credit app goals and signing up members to shop your way. Friendly coworkers but almost no benefits other than associate discount.
good,"I worked there for 3 months and it was the worst 3 months of my life. i hated it. the only good thing that came out of working there was my co-workers. they were so nice to me and looked after me and made sure i did my job right and helped me when i needed it. one of the managers was lazy and would be on his phone all the time, while going behind us during morning rallies telling us to stay off our phones and do our jobs. another manager had treated me poorly and treated me like i was stupid and didnt understand anything even though he took no time to teach me how to do anything. i would get in trouble with customers over something i didnt know how to do because i was not taught how to do things. i shadowed for a bit and did a butt load of computer training that did me no good. "
good,"I loved the work I did at Sears. However, the pay did not meet my expectations. I felt as if you should be given some type of raise after a certain amount of time there. There was never any mention of raises or job advancement."
good,"On rajoute beaucoup de tâches aux superviseurs, ne font plus leur travail de coaching, service après vente laisse beaucoup à désirer, vrai tour de babel"
good,"I have learned a lot of things in this job, management is the worst in this job, half of them disrespect you and do not know how to communicate in private or as team members. My co-workers are very good and hardworking. The hardest part of the job would be floating when hours are cut, the most enjoyable part would be getting enough hours to finish the work properly."
good,"el ambiente laboral es bueno entre compañeros, aprendes mucho de compañeros y clientes que te visitan constante, la parte difícil son los horarios de salida y para fines de año prácticamente vives en la tienda, mi jefe directo atosiga mucho a los compañeros sobre cuotas o metas ya alcanzadas aprovechando que tiene una relacion muy cercana con la gerente de tienda sin saber que ya se habían pasado relación de todo, lo que mas me agrado la experiencia laboral ademas de las prestaciones superiores a las de la ley"
good,The workers were normally friendly and upbeat but the job itself was unnecessarily challenging because management literally changed policy every Monday
good,"Working loss prevention for Sears is intuitive. I learned how to look at employees journals. The management are very friendly but not very informative. My co-workers are nice and fun to work with, the hardest part of my job are the hours."
good,"Sears Holdings, at least its web division, is a standard call center environment. You'll do well if you both work hard and network effectively. The vast majority? Will find a job, not a career."
good,"Overall, I actually enjoyed working there, even if it did get a little overwhelming at times.  I was able to meet different people, and help them by just lending an ear to what they had to say. "
good,"A typical day at Sears includes:"
good,"Sears is a family like, fun place to work.  I love all the people I've ever worked with at Sears, and I have long term relationships with a lot of my co-workers that has grown beyond Sears."
good,"I started working at Sears HO in Toronto right after my MBA graduation. Being a Senior FA, I learned a tons form my boss at that time. I was exposed to senior leadership and I gained a lot of good experience. However, after 2 years with lots of turmoil due to restructuring and changes in leadership, the office environment became toxic, no trust, no accountability, no transparency."
good,"retail is all the same is clothing stores, however this management team was a lot better than macs, I did not enjoy working front end a lot. Mainly behind the scenes in Merchandise Pick Up."
good,"We would load trucks with heavy appliances, and deliver them. It was mostly a nice fun job but some of it wasn't the greatest. Delivering in the winter was a little rough due to snow sometimes but we made it work."
good,morning meetings are exciting. team leaders are helpful. discounts are good. no benefits. not much room to grow professionally. upper management needs to communicate more to keep morale up.
good,A lot of travel all across the states of KY and IN to sell home improvement products.  Long days and nights.  Good long lasting company to help sell but management has lost sight of the importance of the sales force and make things such as payment way too complicated.
good,"The job is fun, but the job security and local advertising are misses. Had a fun time with the fellow employees, the push to do better than other stores made the job exciting.  The constant swop of store and assistant managers made it frustrating to come to work everyday, because to the different ways they wanted us to work."
good,"Necesita mas organizacion, es todo comodo, pero el sueldo es muy bajo,..."
good,"The most important thing at Sears is Shop Your Way loyalty, credit apps and protection agreements. They will be on your neck if your numbers are low. Not saying that isn't expected but they dont really care about the customer experience, its all about the margins they can get on products."
good,"Fairly basic retail job interacting with customers and coworkers. Compensation not great, which results in being short staffed. Employees often feel stressed and overworked."
good,"Need to focus on sales everyday low prices , associate job satisfaction. Focus less on scorecard Need to focus on getting the new customer such as younger customer."
good,"Selling home appliances"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashiering, assisting customers in various areas, folding and organizing clothes, putting away returns, customer service. My co-workers were overall helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was that it was seasonal. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and knowing they were truly satisfied and happy with my assistance."
good,"It is a nice place to work, however it needs an upgrade. The co-workers are always complaining about the low wage and the customers never seem to be happy about the treatment. They are focused more on the credit applications than the customer service."
good,Advancement opportunities and work life balance are possible.  Unfortunately this is overshadowed by how difficult it is to implement significant change.
good,"Working in the Protection Agreement department was enjoyable. My piers and the customer's is what made working there fun. The job was not hard at all, it was fairly easy. Sears is a GREAT company to work for and I wouldn't mind working with them again. I did work in a call center rather than retail."
good,The best thing at Sears is meeting the most dedicated and hardworking workers whom I can call friends group together as a team and meet or surpass our daily goals.
good,A typical day was going on sales calls or service calls. Inspecting homes for termites or other pests In which case either a service was performed or if they didn't have a service then a sales proposal was made.After that cold calling was done to secure appoints for the next day. I was promoted to supervisor due to my cold calling sand sales closing ratio. After a while a regime came in that wasn't very friendly to the people already employed there and subsequently the company was sold so I did't stay.
