bad,"Extremely unorganized and not willing to change. "
bad,"You will know if you fit in right away...if not your life will be miserable.  They pick favorites.  If you really want to fit in, say yes master...and don't look the wrong way either."
bad,"Southwest Airlines operates as a small-town company from Texas in the 1970s, on an international stage in the 21st century. They use painfully antiquated administrative processes and every supervisor, trainer and agent has their own way of doing things. They promote appallingly uneducated and unexperienced individuals to management positions while keeping the most skilled and inteligent individuals at the lowest levels."
bad,They make me feel like they just don’t care about you as a person.The back to back calls are overwhelming i hate my job but it pays the bills I’m in school now looking for better
bad,During my time here I was verbally abused by a senior employee.  It got so bad that other employees reported this person to management but their solution was to let me go instead because the other person was a permanent employee and I was contract. This was the worst experience I've ever had but I've learned that no job is worth your sanity.
bad,Is a gate agent or swat Southwest would call an operations agent you would have a 20 minute turnaround time from when the plane pulled into the gate to 10 it’s a push from the gate if that 20 minute time limit was not made you would get wrote up for it even if it was a groundcrew issue you would get wrote up if a customer would send in a complaint letter for whatever reason because the flight was delayed or you would not allow them to Carry on three or four items as FAA regulations only allowed two Items the customer would send in a complaint letter and they would write you up as being rude to the customer Even though you were following FAA regulations and the airline regulations Southwest just didn’t want to look bad and would blame the gate agent.  Then they would write you up
bad,Great job until I came to Houston and dealt with a liar for a manager who would just watching movies all day but would talk about you to other mechanics.  He has his little buddies he hung out with outside of the job and those are his favorite at work.  But he is a complete liar and I have never worked for such a scumbag.  I was in a coma and bad crash and then not even 2 weeks later I’m being forced out.
bad,"The directors have favorites in which they do extra things for. Examples are giving them higher bonuses, sleeping with them, promoting them.   Not good"
bad,Get out while you can.  I personally didn’t like the structure.  Kids are managing you.  You fly stand by only if you can get on a flight. Many employees use their miles
bad,Management sucked very rude. Pay 9.00 hour to be rushed to do 12-14 planes in 6 hours. NOT GIOD WIRK PLACE. Airport is very unsafe as far as the people who would drive from the terminal to the planes . can't believe they haven't wrecked with a plan yet . CARELESS
bad,if you decide to belong to this company you could have the opportunities to grow up like profesional and personal. But only have to be careful what position do you want to obtain because no all position have the same benefits.
bad,"Manager is a psycho. Think she’s all that. Hires delinquents and rude people and the HR department is a freaking joke as well.  “Hey we want to interview you” “hey I’m sorry we made a mistake we don’t want to interview you” “hey sorry there was a mistake we want to interview you” wth do you hr people do just sit there on your phones all day? And the staff is a lazy bunch of folks. Always trying not to work bum off their shift. Congrats you’re a 14 year bag slinger, doesn’t make you special. More than half the staff has an IQ of -12.  They purposely damage luggage,I’ve seem them steal things from people,  talk awful things about all the customers, TAKE  PHOTOS AND POST THEM IN A GROUP ON FB. Did I mention the manager is terrible and thinks that instilling fear is a way to work a company? Do yourself a favor, and run. It’s the most disrespected airline in the airport. Get over yourself.  HR and Manager you should be ashamed for choosing such trash to represent what was supposed to be the best airline, I hear Denny’s is hiring, maybe theyd like a manager like you there."
bad,Unfortunately no care for employees or families.  I had a newborn who was sick a lot and the company simply didn’t care.  Employee would come to work with the flu because they were so scared to call in.
bad,was part time but required to work 35 plus normally about 50 hr per week bad management in STL... Will never work for SWA again. End of probation they said I wasn't a good fit walked me out like a crook. No explanation
bad,"a lot of good people, but a lot of cut throat people closing shift.  Manager to close to employees.  Passed all training, but in airport training to many chiefs doing diffrent thinngs"
bad,You don't want work for Southwest you don't have any Family time and if you are late for work three time They will be FIRED QUIETLY they will treat you like number they don't care about you they can replace you any time. southwest make but money its about $$$$$$$$$$$$.
bad,Its so focus on making money that fails to provide public and employees safety. All employees are hurt but if they make it known they harass you in hopes you quit.
bad,The culture at the LUV airline is the opposite. Management and Architect have opposing views of what should be accomplished. Business Analysts have limited access to Business SMEs. There is no LUV :(
bad,They are unfair when it comes to helping and protecting employees.  They only think of themselves.  When they say they are family oriented that is NOT true.
bad,Southwest should be ashamed to posted those minimum salaries for a prestigious airline that it is. I enjoy flying Southwest would recommend to anyone. Those salaries should minimum 15.00 at the least. the CEO and administrative Staff sucking up all the profits while the little guys breaking their backs for peanuts
bad,"Very stressful. Management does not support you or your decisions, stabs you in the back, doesn't promote employees who deserve to be promoted but will promote them if they sleep with them."
bad,"Low pay and horrendous management after AirTran acquisition. Used to be a great place to work. Micromanagement is their style. They tout their no layoff history, but they will fire you for no good reason just to show off their prowess in management which is a laughable farce."
bad,"Unfortuantely, the pay was so horrible that in orderto make a living you had topick up overtime hoursjust to make ends meet. That is not including the mandatory overtime they give you. They are not flexible with your schedule, and you definitely do not get paid enough for all that you do"
bad,Start off fixing and taking care of the shifts work load and then start on yours. Was not taught anything but to learn quick you were alone on help and asked questions no one knew nothing.Co-workers were always worried about losing their jobs.Trying to go to work not as a team. Nothing was enjoyable about the job or company
bad,Poor management. Station manager set me up to take a fall for him after I blew the whistle on him.  I was let go and he was transferred.
bad,... Contractor for sw airline worked all day and all night just too much for little
bad,"If you don't like it, leave before they fire you. You must accept it as is or you will be marginalized and eventually terminated. I can honestly say that I wasted nearly 13 of my best working years for this deceitful company. Don't believe all the praises as this company spends a lot of money to promote itself and it's propoganda. Horrible, overall for my health."
bad,I really enjoyed my time at Southwest.  It is truly the fun airline
bad,"In 20 years of workplace experience I've ever worked at in 20 years of workplace experience in IT environments.  Very toxic, back biting and undermining."
bad,". Typical was very stressful and very physical. I feel management is uncaring and only cares for the business end of everything and not the workers who makes the Airline an Airline. People that are Union is there number one priority. I had a problem with the person training me they weren't training me properly and I brought to the attention of the supervisor and because I had said something, I was almost fired. I should of known to leave then. They should of called a meeting with the both of us, unfortunately they chose to have a meeting with the person training me and others which didn't include me. I was injured weeks later and I had a couple surgeries no one never called to see how I was doing and after I was ready to come back to work they did not accommodate me for a different position cause of my disabilities. I feel because I didn't make to be Union I wasn't worth being placed in another position. Everything was an excuse I didn't have computer experience However I worked for 4 Airlines and I have no computer experience. I apply at Customer call center which requires computer experience However a person that worked with me in the same department had also applied and they had absolutely no experience with computers. But they hired them cause they were union and also send them to training for computers and the job."
bad,"The best airline job you could hope for with an excellent company culture. The working conditions are excellent. They stress safety, and are not willing to cut corners. The management is very good, and they have made money for every year they have been in existence. My immediate supervisors (chief pilots and such have always been excellent. The corporate philosophy is to make everyone feel part of the team, and they have a very lucrative profit sharing to prove it."
bad,"If your not in with the ""click"" they dismiss you and make up something."
bad,N/A.  Nada nada nada. Go to work here if you like to suck like all Of the other cool aid drinkers. If you enjoy being micro managed this company is for you.
bad,Contracts/temps remain contractors/temps for years. Most are not made permanent. Unless completes two years of temp contracts. Temp contracts are renewed every six months. Then when over might be asked to become permanent.
bad,"If management sucks, you can forget about furthering yourself in this company. I was fired just because I did not want to listen to a creeper Supervisor who likes to stare at crotches and never gets in trouble. And there you have it."
bad,"Ridiculously unfair, biased, competitive for no valid reason, like working with vultures when management does not like you due to unfair hearsay within Supervisors."
bad,Can't  trust management if they don't like you they'll do everything in their power to get you out and would never promote you. There's a lot of unhappy employees and a lot of cut throat going on very unhealthy environment.
bad,"Managers were not friendly,   Were not very helpful. A lot of manually work. Not up to date on Payroll Time keeping system. The Managers were unprofessional"
bad,"They start you out in Dallas for two weeks paperwork training. Told time and time again that there's no hazing ( because probies or newhires have zero recourse or protection from abuse or harrassment). After that you're on your own. No aircraft training whatsoever. Expected to teach yourself the job and do it better than unioned mechanics. Some of the worst maintenance I've seen in 15+ years. Dallas seemed to keep boasting that they are fined more because they are more successful. BS they earn every penny of every fine. Their ""probation"" is nothing more than a popularity contest and an excuse to demean and harrass better mechanics than they are."
bad,"This was not a good fit for me, but that was because I did not ask enough questions about the situation."
bad,"Don't be fooled into thinking the monthly birthday cake celebrations and all the other culture window dressing is anything more then too much cheap food coloring. This company will throw a witch hunt at the drop of a hat. Watch your back every day. "" know your company!"" Ironically that is the very language they use in there, it's a matter of respect training. It's good advise. If you stick around long enough you will learn the game and the characters. After 11yrs of service at marginal pay. You will finally earn a livable wage, which they will try to take from you at any opportunity. Good luck and remember have fun!"
bad,"Supervisors dont care if you get a break. Forced mandatory o.t.  Houston is the red headed step child. Less than 1 year ago, station manager and adm were forced to tes"
bad,"I have learned that while Southwest states they are about the employees, there is no follow through on that. The leaders prefer people who simply agree with them instead of finding the best way. If you do not agree with leaders, there is not much room for advancement. I have also learned that females are treated very differently. When surveys showed this and we had internal meetings to discuss it, there was no follow through from leadership on the issue. It continues to be an issue."
bad,What a joke of an Airline! Supposed to be so great to work for?? Well why are they always hiring full time ramp agents when the other big three rarely hire. Because they keep there employees and don’t abuse them with mandatory overtime poor management paper trails on every employee. Steer clear of Southworst Airlines to fly and work for. Get a Job with United if possible much better company with a REAL UNION! IAM.
bad,Need to pay employees more. It’s a billion dollar company that pays employees peanuts. I would not recommend SWA to anyone. They have a great concept wish they paid more.
bad,"Hours are by seniority so I got the worst shifts, and my schedule was constantly adjusted from coming in mornings, to mid-day shifts to night shifts, all in the same week so there was not much of a sleep schedule, no time for a social life. Lots of gossip, attitudes and back stabbing from other admins. Overworked and stressed out. Many system issues and plumbing/structural issues."
bad,"Southwest Airlines is not all about equality. They only hire African Americans to pose as they are promoting equality but once you start working there, you will see how unprofessional and racist . They really are. This was the worse job I have ever had. Only the money was the invitation of staying but my peace comes first."
bad,"I was surprised by the cult like environment and total unprofessional behavior of management. They have empathy for the customers,  not the employees. Very surprising."
bad,Southwest cares about making profit for themselves and they are a very racist company. They don’t care about the health and safety of the employees in the Call Centers.
bad,"Ramp employees suck for the most part. Want to do nothing, are highly paid and are cry baby complainers. If they don’t like you, they will force new hires out. They dislike new hires because it takes away from their overtime. "
bad,"Nepotism runs deep here."
bad,"they talk a lot of love,but there is no love, once you are injured on the job, they will phase you out.there benefits are ok, pay is good, but no loyalty to the employees."
bad,"The company offers a great product to the customers. As far as the work goes, it was always a 2 man crew. The work was a lot for 2 people to do. These aircraft would come 100% full and you only had 20 minutes to do a complete turn around. Just glad that I was able to experience what the company was all about."
bad,Great benefits and pay. Management isn't very helpful and if you are having any personal issues you can forget seeking guidance or counsel from anyone. The culture has completely died off and every man is for himself.
bad,Lack of adherence to policy and procedures. They take success for granted. Workers are in clicks. Technology is outdated a wonder how the company makes a profit.
bad,"Southwest, fantastic at moving people from one destination to another. It is a homophobic company that treats those different than the religious right differently."
bad,"I'm blessed to have a job, but We employees are over worked and mistreated most of the time. I learned to do the best that I can in a safe manner for me and my co-workers, I also learned to never give up, no matter what the situation may be. All of my co-workers are very hard workers like myself, but always getting injured do to being over worked. The hardest part of the job is stacking the heavy baggage into the aircraft because we have to move quickly so that the aircraft can fly out on time, and to try to stay hydrated on a very hot day. The most enjoyable part of this job is working beside my co-workers who try to help make the work day a good one,"
bad,If you get selected for this position you will be at the bottom of seniority and be prepared to work 17-20 hour days and come right back for another 20 hour day. Station Manager was a joke and never there to help out. You will have no social life working there and get stuck with terrible hours. Eventually you can get full time but be prepared to work Thursday-Monday 5pm-1:30am and then with planes being late being stuck till 3am and then if someone calls off in the morning shift being low guy seniority you will be the guy that has to work his 5am-1:30pm shift then come back for your own shift at 5pm. Be prepared to never sleep and get slaved for 10.28$ an hour.
bad,I was really excited to get the job at Southwest because I heard nothing but good things about the company. So the next thing that happened to me was I got diagnosed with a terminal illness so I could no longer do the job..they told me not to worry they had this program that will help me... they didn't do what they said.
bad,"When I was working for Southwest, I thought that the work life would be manageable but I was wrong. The management was very pressuring when it came to my performance and time at work. The management was very picky about how much time you spend on the phone as well as how much time you spend off the phones. I barely had enough time to take breaks. In terms of performance, I tried being upfront and asked them about my progress and they kept dodging my questions saying that everything was fine. A few days later, they had the senior representatives come to my desk and monitor me in the calls. After a couple weeks,I got a phone call saying that I was let go. I was very upset that they never told me that what was going on even after I tried asking them. I would not suggest working for them if you are looking for a customer service role."
bad,"Company is great but the HOUSTON local management is not as great to provide tools and trainer ( fun loving trainer at DALLAS TRAINING CENTER ) to make you successful on your probation period not effectively looking your peers.You got hired after so many application and company spend good amount of money on your hiring process and terminate the knowledgeable and experienced aviation back ground employees because of the Non professional trainer on probation period. Local management ruin my career and put me in financial hardship not giving opportunity to deliver my experience and knowledge."
bad,Micromanagement is common. Hours are ok if you are a single college kid. Free flights are good. HAve to be able to brave the elements of the weather 365
bad,"Job is great but the company doesn't care about individuals. You are either an asset or a liability. Great if you start when you are young but if you are middle age or older. Watch out, very dangerous job."
bad,"first time working as a contractor for southwest airlines and it was a mess.. poor communication between staffing agency and southwest airlines but you get blamed on both ends.. its pretty shady how swa doesn't tell me everything upfront but keep me in the shadow as well as the agency but they blame me. you sacrifice so much to get to this point especially waiting 2 months and everything is told to you day of work Monday oh by the way you work the weekends, oh by the way no training class so employees force you to work on day one.. they call the role a console so you will be making outbound calls for mot, updating time in the system, look at long calls and making any adjustments, answer any questions employees have, help with seating arrangements etc. this position i was told you have to go through agency. I never wanted to leave but integrity is something i value.. I wish things were more upfront than being told day of sadly."
bad,Everything is timed your calls even going to the restroom. I learend that during the interview that if your not offered a team lead position you will have a hard time advancing.
bad,"Bottom of the barrel management and some of the passengers as well"
bad,"Working around the clock from gate to gate to get the planes out on time. Back to back aircraft at different gates, not enought time to have a lunch. Summer season school is out, kids travel fun time."
bad,I worked for southwest for a year. At first I loved the job until my son got sick I had to call out a couple days didn’t even know if he was going to make it they harassed me back to work hit me with a whole lot of points basically to the point that I wouldn’t ever be able to roll over to go to another position or do anything within the company cool. Then I found out I was pregnant high risk I still worked as much as I could there were times I was told to lift human remains alone while there would be someone at the end of the belt loader that knew I was pregnant. Then there were times I got sick during flights causing me to get out of the plane to vomit. There was a time where my feet swole up so bad I couldn’t put shoes on they told me I had to come in to show them. When I got there the person they put on the schedule in place of me was nowhere to be found I was told I couldn’t leave until I found him. Then eventually my doctor put me completely out of work I still continued to call in to work everyday. The week I was due to return to work I ended up nearly bleeding to death my child passed away they harassed me to come back to work they didn’t care no sympathy no nothing. A year later I’m still traumatized I contacted the union nobody ever got back to me eventually they terminated me and said just forget me like I was nothing.
bad,start working at 3am in mco flight  full flight  a lot of people at the gate  and the flight is on time during the flight take off we did it again  good gob guys
bad,"This was a call center job. Very highly micromanaged and supervisors and management was very critical of everything. the starting pay is extremely low, but if you were willing to stay for basically at least 20 to 30 years, you can actually make some good money. probably the only positive things were the health benefits and the flight benefits."
bad,Upon arriving from training I did not meet with a supervisor for over 4-6 weeks. I was not provided with essential information to perform my job correctly and efficiently.  When I lost a family member I took days off for their passing and upon returning I was told I was in danger of losing my job because of it. There was no empathy or compassion from anyone from Southwest Airlines. Management was horrible to me. Workplace moral was the lowest I've ever experienced. A typical day at work was always dealing with computer problems that would not allow for assisting customers effectively. The only good this there were my coworkers and how we bonded by dealing with all the horrible things we had to work through due to our working conditions. Definitely the worst job I have ever had.
bad,This company expects the employees to come in and log into all work applications a half hour everyday and read all daily updates on their own time without pay and you log off of your phone to clock out. Then you must shut down your computer on your own time and restart it. The pay doesn’t make my bills that it costs to live and take care of me and my 2 kids. This is a job for a double income household. They also do not let you eat your lunch when you want or take your breaks when you want. You are told when to eat and when to take your breaks.
bad,"This would be a great place to work if the MRO's would allow you to lead and not micomanage everything you do. Most of them have little to no ramp experience to start and will find ways to make your work day impossible if you stand-up to them. You are stuck in the middle as a Ramp Supervisor, Ramp agents have a union and the MRO is backed by upper management, if you are not liked the will find a way to push you out."
bad,"You cannot grow here, the pay is really bad and all that you get is flight benefits. There is no time to travel as you are trying to work as much as you can so that you can make just enough to pay bills."
bad,"Colleagues and industry were fun to work with. There are mid-level supervisors who were a joy to work with. But upper management will work new-hires till the point that it seems --exploitative, unethical and questionably legal. Burnt-out employees leave a revolving door for the station at STL to constantly hire; so staffing demands are never met and employees are meant to take over those shifts. This is an honest review by an honest employee, and I regret to even say this, but this is what occurs."
bad,"WN let me go based on a lie, and even though my manager walked in right behind me and saw what was going on with employee airport security who made me an hour an half late for work due to racism, my manager's did nothing to protect me, instead it was held against me and I was let go, regardless that I showed up for work everyday and did over-time whenever requested. The management at WN spends all it's time seeking to find problems with it's employees rather than leading them to success, unless they fall under nepotism."
bad,Execs don't seem to know (or want to know) the truth of their program timelines. So they push to an unrealistic schedule despite being warned that projects won't end on time and their are multiple people burning out due to working so many hours. PM 101- talk to the SME's first for accurate estimates and then build a realistic schedule and stop beating up on employees for not doing things fast enough. Some of the nicest co-workers you'd ever meet as well as first line management.
bad,"It's a job. As stated, you'll be poor and overworked forever. It's a 24/7 environment, so be ready to work until 3 or 4 in the AM if that's your shift. Want to advance? Be willing to wait for the people who have been there for 20 years to quit, get fired, or laid off....This is a hostile environment"
bad,"This company brags that it has never had ""Lay-offs"" and is such a desired company to work for.....You never have to lay people off when you constantly fire everyone for every little thing and the awesome place to work is a brilliant marketing strategy to make sure there is always someone to replace you!"
bad,"Often required to work overtime some times more than 17hours a day. High turnover in management."
bad,if you want to be back stabbed and treated like a machine this is your place. don't expect much from the union either. they are a company union that lets the company dictate anything they are not willing to fight
bad,Worked for many airports and the airlines in general are poor employers. They don't really mention that at the drop of a hat they can require you to work 3 days of 16 hour shifts in a row (basically sleep on the floor of the facility for 3 days if allowed since no time to go home) and no life-work balance. Many other poor aspects too. Airport Management or Operations is much better area if you are having a career in aviation.
bad,Cult like atmosphere where people pay to get a day off to other workers who take advantage of them.Management lets people extort each other and turns a blind eye to it.
bad,"I worked very hard for Southwest Airlines. The pay was horrible and they would juniored you all the time, meaning they could extend you 4 hours no questions asked. After two years there I think I got a .50 cent raise and my hours were like 5:30 in morning to 1pm. My final pay was 8.96 per hour. Job was exciting but not worth it for me."
bad,"Southwest was not a good company to work for as a contractor. "
bad,"Lacks Management have no clue what they are doing. Overworked and under paid. The culture is awful! Do not recommend anyone to work here! Be aware, go and work for another airline!"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. The management here is awful, and has no idea how to make a bid out. They hit people for ridiculous amounts of mandatory overtime, and I actually saw supervisors laughing and getting excited about popping people for OT.  One of the trainers I had was a complete jerk, and would degrade me right in front of others. The AirTran people think they are superior to others, and act like they know it all. "
bad,"Without strong union representation flight attendants find it hard to implement FAA mandated just safety culture programs such as ASAP and FADAP."
bad,"ok company to work for pay could be better, the benefits are impressive and they do match your 401k benefits. you get flight benefits, and medical benefits."
bad,"Load/Unload baggage onto aircraft. Service Lavs/snack area on plane. "
bad,"southwest was a very stressfull job, calles were time so you could not give the time and effort for good customer service that the consumer expects.    if I had been a customer and was told to call back when I had my credit card I wouldn't"
bad,Not fair in terms of advancement or pay. Very strict lunch and short lunches. Micro managing is the worst especially when its not looked upon according to whats stated in policy. Management is all about if they like you or not not performance.
bad,The typical day consists of a eight or ten hour shift on the phone. The schedule is heavily regulated with no room for error. The call center culture is completely different than the culture at corporate. There is little to no support and you can unwhitingly end up in a hearing with no warning. Loved my co workers and customers but the COA and Team Leaders micro manage your every move which makes a fun job taxing and stressful.
bad,"agents say if higher management don't care why should we. no issues get resolved, jobs go undone, cant ask for help from higher management because they don't know anything about customer service stuff."
bad,"You will not be able to use your flight benefits the first 6months as you WILL be scheduled to work mandatory overtime on your days off. This is a stressful environment because There are never enough employees to cover the demand therefore, new employees are forced to work mandatory odd shifts.(in addition to scheduled shift) There is no consideration  for you or your family if you need time off, even if things were planned months in advance. (Wedding, vacations, therapy, etc) You are required to report to work sick or injured or you risk being fired. You can trade shifts with another employee but that shift will often be extended. You will be tapped on the shoulder an hour before you leave and told your shift is extended 2 or 3 hours. The ""Luv Culture"" is a joke. While the environment is fun loving for the most part,  The majority of the Veteran employees will NOT bend over backwards to help the new employees. They are often out of uniform and have nasty attitudes. THE manager does not exude the fun loving attitude that is expected and is rarely available. Your concerns are unheard. So, don't bother expressing them.  The supervisors are better to work with but there are so many that rotate shifts from different areas, its difficult to get to know their style of supervision. There is alot of turn over.Just giving you the true experience of working  for  Southwest. If you can deal with the above, go for it.  If you have a family, think long and hard about the sacrifice."
bad,"Management was extremely unfair and racist on the Dallas Ramp, unorganized , union employees and management do not get along at all, Supervisor non union but not management stuck in the middle."
bad,"I've worked at Southwest for over 2 years now. I've met a lot of good friends. Benefits are good, 3 different options for medical benefits. Plus flight benefits if you have the time to fly. "
bad,Come to work and keep your head down and you will be fine. Most of the time you will be working understaffed. Union is great if there was more activity. We pay for this and no one ever shows up to vote
bad,At this time I have no additional comments to say about the company. If it is something you wish to try and is our opinion. Just prepare yourself for it all.
bad,"I worked in IT at Southwest.  The management was pretty poor and constantly changing.  Individual efforts and results were not rewarded.  As a contractor, I was invisible.  Contractors were treated as expendable parts and not valued."
bad,"Priority changes constantly"
bad,I would not recommend using this job as a means to retire. The contracts are not respected. Managements expectations are unrealistic with the unsafe work conditions.
bad,"Quick turn over, would not reccommend. No good experience."
bad,"People are so stuck up their own ideals that anything new is scary to them. Certain issues won’t be sent up the chain of command; specially if it’s brought up by someone hired on as a temp or from a third party agency. "
bad,It depends on where you work at the airport. You are going to work a lot of hours because you need to in order to receive a reasonable paycheck.  You are not on a consistent schedule because it fluctuates depending on the needs of the airline industry.  You can switch every month to every 2 months or every 6 months depending on the flight schedule and your management putting the schedule together.
bad,"You work really long hours, holidays, weekends and overtime. Job culture is great, really fun atmosphere must of the time but it can be a very stressful job. If you like having a life outside of an airport this job is not for you."
bad,"The work/life balance has declined to the point where it does not exist.  Also, management is rather poor and treats their employees like a commodity and not as people.  It is not worth the headache of working for Southwest Airlines Technology at this time."
bad,"There are many pros and cons with Southwest, just like any other company.  Once your in for 6 years the pay starts getting better and makes it harder to leave for equal pay.  Its an entry level job no matter how you look at it."
bad,"There were opportunities to interact with, learn from and support customers and coworkers in an open, direct manner."
bad,I like the company but for it to be a multimillion dollar company they can't seem o get the pay correct. Checks were always incorrect on the short side not over payments.
bad,It was a good place to work for the longest but when the man that started the whole thing left or retired or was forced out it changed and not for the good. I mean the pay was ok well better than ok but the work conditions were not the best and I did not see them getting better.
bad,"Some of the Managers do care about the company and its employees.  Unfortunately, some of the Managers and Supervisors do NOT know how to effectively manage employees.  It is a busy work/operational enviroment, which for me was enjoyable and the work was interesting.  However, there are so many stringent rules, that it's difficult to keep up with them all and they seem to constantly change in some settings, with no flexibility.  Mgmt and union rarely see eye-to-eye or cooperate, so there is constant tension.  There is a high turnover rate at BWI and for those employees that work the operation--ramp, customer service and operations agents, there is NO balance of work/life.  Employees are constantly forced to work overtime at the blink of an eye and come in on their days off with very little notice.  While everyone should understand the need for overtime in any operation, it should not be the constant norm.  In general, co-workers were friendly and helpful, but everyone was constantly complaining and stressed about the work enviroment and lack of effective management, it did not make for a nice place to work."
bad,"Should provide more flexibility with time off requests"
bad,Watch out for the new hires... you will be STABED!! Management smile in your face but don’t care.. just be careful and watch your back. It’s not all fun and games!!
bad,Not for me .. loved the people but did not feel like they valued education and experience at the local levels. They value seniority and have a lot of favoritism at the local levels. The schedule was brutal as there is not much flexibility.
bad,"Out of all the organizations I have worked for Southwest Airlines rates one of the lowest, most likely due to Mid-Management.  The company is highly profitable, nice working condition.  The only thing I really didn't like was the facade of being a US/Texas Company that promotes US employees on the outside.  Once you enter the inter-office environment you notice a high H1B visa employment ratio.  The mid-managers seems to be very cliquish and promote Ethnic nepotism.  Not the Southwest Airlines I remember."
bad,"Great company overall, but awful management and moral at a local level. Most of the time it feels like you are just a number to the company. Benefits are good, but the work is not. Very unfulfilling job."
bad,"If you want to be hired by Southwest, show signs during the interview that you will take care of management and that you are easy to get along with and that you do not harbor resentments. What management wants most is to have the employees under them look get along with everybody so as not to make the manager look good in front of others. Given that you are highly competent in your skill level, giving the appearance of being easy going and having no issues from the past is the key to getting past the interview."
bad,". The VP seems unaware of the situations going on with those employees on the front line and those who are just above front line. Discipline structure is lacking and those who wrote the standards and culture to live by do not live by these standards set for those below them. Granted, not everyone is like this in this area of Southwest but I hate to think what the founders of this great airline would think if they saw what was really happening.  One in particular rules by fear and manages by personal feelings and then attempts to use company policy against reports to their leaders' reports. Some managers pour some strong kool-aid here but buyer beware...there may be poison in your cup if you aren't careful.  Office politics are stronger than usual here - upper levels encourage an open door policy but realistically do not believe in this without regrets. Lots of complacency and not enough change in some parts where it really matters, too many individual opinions to create change. Signing up for extra committees and finding out later you are unable to balance the work load and then politely declining will send up red flags. I saw this as directors seeing as a sign of weakness and then becoming an immediate target. Unusual amounts of office politics rampant in a company that encourages a great culture and rides on the ""Luv"" spirit that is so formally pressed from Day 1.  "
bad,"I worked at Southwest Airlines in Seattle for 4 months. I didn’t even know who my leader (station manager) was. I only learned on my last day. He wears jeans. "
bad,"get flight plan,fuel for pilots,disembark passengers,make flight announcements for departing flight.take tickets from passengers.make sure no one was left behind.make sure plane was secure,the operate jet way away from plane.how to deal with irate passengers.management was never around unless there was an issue.very stressful work environment.getting 137pass. plus carry on2 off and 137 pass on.plus carry-ons the plan in 20 minutes.discounts or free air travel."
bad,"The probationary period is reviewed by flight attendants who have just completed their probationary period. Sometimes personalities just do not mix together, and because of that, the off probation attendant writes anonymous survey's about the other and management believes it."
bad,"Overall in the beginning great company to be with, but in the end CEO change and your more like a number then family to them. Good Ins. Benefits still with the company , and that is hard to come by these days."
bad,"A typical day at work includes making, changing, and cancelling reservations for Corporate Customers, Travel Agents and the General Public, and putting up with numerous  Team Leaders who will walk the floors and ""listen"" for mistakes, like a ""witch hunt"" or something.  They don't layoff per say, but will follow the process to get you out, and if you go to another department or to  inflight (like many have) and don't make it thru, they will NOT TAKE YOU BACK, unless you are a favorite.  I know 1st hand of jobs that were ""found"" @ LGA, BUR, LAS, and DAL to name a few places for some of those that were not able to ""cut the mustard"" of their new position so to speak.I learned that they do have their ""favorites"" even if your score card is pretty much perfect, they will find ways to get rid of you, or make your life miserable.  Co Workers are great, lots of Happy Hours, trips to SeaWorld, Disney, etc... , even though we have lost about 20 on my team since 3rd quarter 2013, from walkouts, firings or forced ""retirements"".  The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what the various Team Leaders want, and which ones you can ""trust"", as there is so much inconsistency.  Southwest refuses to charge for bags and changes which is great, but their NEED for  extra revenue is HIGH, and they have us soliciting for the Chase Visa,  Early Bird Check In's, Business Select tickets, Rental Cars and Hotels.  Chase, Hotels and Rental Cars pay Southwest a commission for each one that is booked.  Employees do not receive a commission, but if you miss it on a call, they let you know about it "
bad,"As fantastic as the glamour of Southwest Airlines is, when you get to the root of it all, Southwest is an entirely awful company to work for. It's fantastic benefits and great culture do not make up for the mandatory overtime, 16 hour + days with little to no breaks, and abhorrent policies on attendance and sick leave. Do not expect your thoughts, concerns, or health (both mental and physical) to matter to the company or it's management."
bad,"It's a good place to work with a top out at 32 an hour. However, the regulations with FAA and the workplace make it a difficult and almost hazardous work environment that sometimes leads to hostilities. The pay is too low for a union job in CO, 12.50 is NOT survivable."
bad,"Southwest Used to be a great company. It was a job that most employees looked forward to going to work every day. However, within the past 5 years, the company has changed substantially to a point where most employees are disgruntled."
bad,"Southwest is a wonderful company to work for, but the call center is not. Everything is micromanaged which makes the work enviornment very stressful, the building is dirty and unsanitary. Theres a call flow script that has to be followed at work and we're suppose to do sales with that same script which sounds very robotic and unnatural making it more difficult to get a sale, also if you make one small mistake you get a ""coaching"" which is put into a discussion log, which has a impact on you advancing to a diffrent department.. The workplace is like any other call center always busy depressing dirty, they sell you a dream and fantasy at TOPS in Dallas..The call center in my opinion is the lowest ranking department to work for..Personally i would wait and apply into a diffrent department if you want to get your ""foot in the door"" or work for Southwest."
good,"I was hired to bring in a new perspective to the benefits area. I was excited after the interview to join Southwest Airlines. I was told I had 6 direct supports, Subject Matter Experts. Day one, I discovered not only responsible for the SMEs but 10 other call center staff all of which needed development, etc. The perks outlined during the interview was not as stated, I was not able to travel not was I off every other Friday"
good,"If you’re a contractor it’s hard to become a full time employee. Unless you know someone inside. Lots of nepotism and good ol boy clubs to get ahead. "
good,I was a contractor for SWA and there wasn't any insensitive on making me permanent or anything like that.  I did enjoy the work because of my love for technology.
good,"It used to have a relaxed, fun culture.   Now its like working in a sweatshop...crazy hours and days off, no work life balance at all.  I enjoyed working with the customers and making their days better with my troubleshooting skills, however working without any benefits and never having a weekend off, or working a schedule like 7 pm to 3 am is crazy!"
good,f((( swa racist management/headquarters out of dallas. working at the company was pure torture
good,You are expected to be competent in many different job roles and only paid for ONE. very low pay for what is required  from you. This company does not recognize Holidays and if you get sick they only allow you ONE doctors note PER YEAR. Its  not the company it was when Herb Kelleher
good,The company it self is not bad. However poor management on the local level. Most Co workers are bitter and don't want to help or deal with new hires. You can not speak up for your self either.
good,If you get hired somewhere else then it will be an amazing adventure but not in Denver. THe back to back mandatory overtime will wear you down quick. The 6 months probation know you can get fired for someone else's mistakes not worth the risk. I visited other stations and they are amazing. Apply for a different department other than Customer Service and you'll do just fine.
good,"Over the Southwest is a decent company, it has decent perks and benefits. The advancement opportunities are there if you can put in the time and countless hours. The company itself is good but sadly as it filters down to the individual airports management is very lacking and treats employees with very little respect and expect you to dedicate your life to the company. Very long hours."
good,Over the years the fun culture got reduced due to new management rules and requirements and became more money driven then customer care. The company started adding all types of fees and took the flexibility away from customer service agents and placed it under management approvals.
good,"So im only doing this to help anyone who is looking to apply at southwest as a cs&s and give an honest view of the company . What your going to expect is , awesome training in dallas for a few weeks where u will see how the culture is really great at headquarters. Once training is done you soon realize how different it is from other departments. The call center is very micromanaged your numbers (metrics) have to be on point consistently or you will get coached. Breaks and lunches are short and any overage will be counted against you . Any major weather issue will effect your hours and will most likely be given mandatory overtime. The best part would be that your able to give away shifts if someone is willing to pick it up for you ( mostly for cash). But if you are new your schedule will be evenings and weekends. Team leaders can make or break you . Some will be relaxed and not give you a hard time others will make things difficult and write you up for the smallest things and be sent to a hearing. I didnt like the fact that some workers got away with alot and others had to do everything just right to keep their job . The major downside ,which is why most of my class quit after a year, was there is very limited opportunity for growth . The team leaders dont actively encourage advancement . The main places you would be able to go is either airport which many already have spots filled or headquaters in dallas. So in essence it could take awhile to transfer out if at all . As i mentioned the culture in dallas is phenomenal my only regret is not applying in the beginning to a different"
good,"Great place to work if you like flying places for free BUT you have no life with the inconsistent scheduling, you work nights as long as there are more senior people there."
good,Depending on which station you go to depends on culture.  You have to talk to mgmt to be able to apply to a position depending on favoritism. There's a lot of complaints of racism meanwhile there is no diversity in HDQ.
good,Retired due to lack of advancement and poor management. Benefits decreased and only yearly salary increase potential.  Also company culture which made after hours participation mandatory.
good,Good company great for young people that likes flexible hours
good,I leared alot of bad things that I didnt know about southwest. I was working form them for 5 years!!
good,"The starting pay is very low, especially if you start later in life and have financial responsibilities.  You can pick up extra shifts or hours to add to your income, but then you are working yourself to death.  The hardest parts of the job are being on your feet 24/7, lifting very heavy bags and some of the passengers are just horrible.  Be prepared to deal with all types of passengers, some are very nice and some are basically crazy.  I do enjoy my co-workers, we always try and help each other and have some fun on the job.  The travel benefits are good, when you can get off and there are open seats.  This has been a very interesting experience, working at a mega station airport.  Every time I think I have seen or heard it all, it is topped by the next week.  Good company/culture to work for, just start young or maybe as a second job after retirement."
good,Southwest is the perfect job for someone fresh out of high or college (Depending on their major). Starting pay is fairly low so the first couple of years is an uphill struggle. If you like hard work and maybe the chance to change job title & relocate southwest may just be for you...Me I put in 6 and a half good years and decided to move on.
good,"Southwest Airlines is contracting their IT departments out to Make cor which is the main company that will hire for Southwrst Airlines."
good,"You feel like in the beginning they want you to succeed but you soon find out that something like getting sick once can get you terminated it becomes a whole different company.  Employee reviews become personal attacks that can get you fired. The actual job it's self is awesome, working with the customers is the best ever and the opportunity to see the world is second to none."
good,typical day is the exact same as yesterday. Maybe a Little weather will rumble your day or sick employee. Culture is very poor. Management is blind to employee harassment or just looks the other way. they will do anything possible to NOT accommodate or meet requirements set by government for ADA- Americans with Disabilities Act and any other LAWS that were made to help protect employees.
good,"Southwest Airlines has grown leaps and bounds over the last decade. With the substantial growth, there are a number of challenges that the company deals with in the daily operations. Leadership lacks follow through on employee performance issues and accountability. Ground Operations supervisors are limited in what they can do to control work flow and performance related issues due to the heavy involvement of the TWU and union contract."
good,"While SWA are consistently rated high on the Fortune list of favorite employers, I can't say my experiences have been positive.  They're wickedly profitable, and this allows them to have a more lackadaisical attitude than the average Fortune 500.  Meetings are often agenda-less and direction-less and there is seldom a degree of urgency affixed to anything.  This is a great environment for folks who aren't Type A but for those of us who are, it doesn't hold much appeal."
good,working at southwest is a dream. the benefits are unrivaled and your co-workers are the absolute best. getting a job with southwest is the best decision you've ever made
good,"Be willing as the station manager said “crawl through the dirt”"
good,"Working at the call center was stressful, tedious, repetitive and not fun as advertised. SWA culture didnt align with what was going on at the center. Lots of stress, no flexibility and lack of compassion. Completely different from what our founder Herb Kelleher lived for."
good,Southwest has a culture that is very unbalanced racially. in the station where i worked the majority of the employees terminated and harassed are black while the white workers are coddled and their errors overlooked.
good,Fast paced always changing.  The company always added additional responsibilities with no additional pay.  The calls and generally non stop.  Lunches are only 30 minutes.
good,"building is dirty and there were always problem areas there.  restrooms were usually broken and port a potties had to be brought onto location.  the team leads (not all), had a bad habit of making your accomplishments into what would result to a failure.  Were not very helpful when you would request information in advancing."
good,"Contractor's are not employees of Southwest Airlines, therefore a review would be looked upon as an outside review of this company, although I can say that Managers should be fully capable of managing their department instead of having no clue how to do such."
good,I did customer service where I took peoples reservations.  I got put on a graveyard shift right when my ex- husband did for his job and we had three little children under four so i had to resign.
good,"You have to do at least a year before being considered for other positions.  This is difficult because the starting pay is low which also comes with a certain culture."
good,"The Company is a fantastic place to work and continues to grow. the people are exceptional to work for and with. In regards to Technology, the CIO and CTO are right on track and leading the company in the right direction, with the right vision and mission."
good,"dead end job poor mgmnt weak unions"
good,"•	Picks up, delivers, and transports cargo and baggage to and from aircraft and prepares records in a timely manner"
good,Southwest airlines needs to break up Families in management located in same stations. If Southwest change the husband and wife teams as well as clicks in the station that are friends with family member it would make a more comfortable place to work
good,The only thing that matters is on time performance. You are just a number at this company. When they say jump you say how high or you can kiss your job goodbye. Very toxic work environment. There are good locations to work at with this company. Unfortunately the Windsor locks location is not one of them.
good,This is not longer the southwest of old. If you want fun work at the airport. The corporate offices have been dungeons and all culture is being removed. The work life balance is gone and the stress levels building wide are going up as they continue to overwork and under pay there new employees. If you have been here 20 years you are set everyone else is on a hard uphill battle.
good,Depending on your seniority you would either get the best shift or the worst shift.  Fast paced atmosphere and depending on which supervisor was on duty your day/night would flow smoothly or not..some were more difficult to work with than others
good,Best part of the job is the tips made every day. You can easily make more money in tips than you would make in a day on the clock. Hardest part of the job had to deal with the equipment we had (or lack thereof) and its quality. Our supervisors aren't the hardest working people and they lose paperwork a lot. Another non-enjoyable part of the job is doing more work than is required of you and not getting anything out of it or having customers ask you questions that you couldn't possibly have the answer to and getting yelled at.
good,"Great benefits but very low pay "
good,Southwest was one the best jobs I have had . I loved all the people I came to know an grow with. I the fact the job was a work out every day.an getting to be out side eveyday
good,"I will first say the benefits as far as flying and medical dental are very good and the culture with the airline are great. But if you work or want to work in the call center...... please think again. "
good,"This is a difficult place to work if you are on the ramp. The conditions are tough as you are working in all kinds of weather. The management leaves a lot to be desired and the pay leaves a lot to be desired considering the working conditions. The benefits on the other hand as far as health, 401 K, stock options etc. are very good."
good,"85% travel throughout the Southeast Region to include Mega stations Dallas, Chicago, Orlando, Atlanta.  Co workers in the field were great to work with.  Hardest part of the job was in consistent travel and management that did not know how to set attainable goals"
good,"The company will make you work for your paycheck, for sure. Great culture and company pride. Hard physical labor!"
good,"The co-workers are congenial, friendly, helpful. The customers are pleasant to talk to. Scheduling is very rigid, and constantly changing. Stimulating because there are always changes and new things to learn. Travel benefits apply, space available only, so difficult to actually use except mid-week and not on a holiday. Good health benefits."
good,"Southwest Airlines is an interesting place to work and very fun as well. The work is hard and the pay is low, but the benefits were top notch. The airline industry is very unstable however and my job vanished along with many others"
good,Some stations are better to work in than others. If you find yourself working in SWA U never leave. The short cuts on safety and the lack of care for the employees from ( some ) managers is why the turn over is so high. Your front line takes care of the customers but who really takes care of your front line?
good,Manage 20-25 team members in Customer Service. Operational challenges keep workday from becoming routine; expectation to constantly adapt to changing practices and policies can be challenging.
good,"It really is a great company to work for if you are not working in operations. Operations will chew you up and spit you back out, and no amount of money or extra perks can make up for the lost health and sanity. It is very cliquey, and if you are not ""in"", do not expect to move up. If management likes you as a friend, you will do fine. But don't expect your reviews to be based off of you work performance. I couldn't handle it, many can. That doesn't mean Southwest itself is bad, just this specific group of managers."
good,It's worth it if you don't need a life outside of work. It's long days and a lot of stress. Some co-workers are great some are mean. Supervisors never have your back.
good,Management doesn’t know how to run the operation. Supervisors doesn’t know job they are no help they set you up for failure. Coworkers are awesome but overall the union garbage they don’t fight for you like they say.you get written up for everything. Entire company changed once herb passed.
good,"Brandon is a never ending surge of positive energy and motion. "
good,"The company has many upsides! Traveling for free is a wonderful benefit. Like most companies, the middle managers are just that... middle management, but with hard work you will soon surpass them."
good,"Southwest is really like high school and being part of the in crowd is super important for raises, promotions, and overall workplace happiness. It is not enough to go in with a good attitude and work ethic. You must be willing to attend out of work activities and put in the effort to be friendly with EVERYONE."
good,If you want to work really hard you will like working there. I spent 17 1/2 years there and now am retired.  Getting a job there is easier than leaving.
good,"Very busy atmosphere, never a dull moment. You have to have excellent people skills and lots of patience. Co-hearts are your extended a family. Fun LUV-ing attitude is  plus!"
good,"It was mostly a positive place to work. Union position so job security is great. Long hours and mandatory overtime is frequent. Supervision and Management constantly ""micromanaged"". The other union employees had a great culture."
good,"great people everyday was busy and challenging however the people around you made it easier to get through, the culture and work environment was ever changing and there was little room for error and no room at for you to not be up to date on the latest company changes."
good,Great company to work for in terms of flexibility of schedule. At the agent and supervisor level you have ample opportunity to either pick up extra shifts or give away to other employees to suit your needs. The Health and Dental benefits are second to none. The hardest part about being a front line leader is you are subject to the operation and if a lot of flights are running late due to weather or just normal delays then you have to stay. If you are a junior employee this doesn't mean a great work/life balance for you. If you can tough it out then its a great job.
good,"Work load was good, hours were great and having a cafeteria on site was nice, although the food could have been a little better tasting.  The people were friendly.  It did seem that Southwest Airlines back-office staff seems to be made up primarily of young foreign contract workers primarily to keep salaries lower, except for the people that may have been hired years ago or hose that had customer facing positions. This is excellent place to work for the younger worker."
good,Plan and conduct domestic and international passenger flights in accordance with FAA regulations and company policy.  Analyze weather in all portions of route for safe and legal feasibility of operating each flight.  Monitor airports for restraints as they apply to aircraft performance
good,"This job can be a lot of fun, but it will start to be a burden if your company and union does not support a good job/life balance. The work load gets heavier and more detailed, and having a reasonably normal life with your family is very hard. Even if you are a senior flight attendant, it is hard to have a balanced lifestyle. "
good,"No day is the same working as a ramp agent for Southwest Airlines. I have learned that  you have to adapt very quickly to various situations around you. Management is always a revolving door and needs to be more stable. The culture for Southwest is OK but has the potential to be way better. However, with contact negotiations at a stand still it can be a very unpleasant place to be at times. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with the weather because if you dont have on the proper attire for the day it can become challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around other co- workers and trying to make the best of your day"
good,It was fun to see cool co workers daily. the management was horrible though. the CEO was absolute garbage. all he cared about was money and not at all what the employees had.
good,"Money is great!!!!!! "
good,Run daily reports and greet crew members.  Assign new trips to flight crew and ensure they are whare they need to be for on time departures.  Keep communications open between flight crew and scheduling and be a laison for them.  Call flight crew as needed to conform location.
good,"work like if there is no tomorrow. learned that no matter what one does it is never enough. management has too many issues that can never agree. co-workers fun, loving, and great to work with; some can be difficult but passible. Having to go against all principles in favor of the customer reps. Never a dull moment always something going on."
good,Union jobs with unhappy union employees. Very negative environment around mechanics and shop clerks. If you try to change the culture you become an outcast.  Management does not support supervisors and would rather settle grievances than back the supervisor. Without order there is chaos. Unnecessary chaos.
good,"This internship is reviewed like it's the best thing since sliced bread, when in reality it was just an office job. Cubical for most of the day, some weeks you'd have a intern event but that was it. Cubical, lunch, meetings, repeat. There really wasn't anything special about this internship."
good,"Where to begin...well for starters, they pay for your first two weeks of training in Dallas, teach you everything necessary to get the job done and make it seem like you have a support system there if you wanna succeed. You're placed on a 6 month probationary period in which you HAVE to be on your best behavior (most people don't make it through it because it's THAT fast paced, emotionally draining and irritating) Sadly, I'm sure working at the airport would be a better experience because working at the Reservation call center is a nightmare. Lots of micromanaging, and limited time for restroom breaks and don't you DARE get used to break overages... call after call, after call and no time in between if a customer makes you cry or angry (unless you step away from your cubicle to do so, you're being timed for that too), oh and you do get two, 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch but make sure to get back close to the EXACT time you're allowed, because you'll get in trouble for not keeping an eye on time too.Would not recommend to soft hearted people who are actually willing to help others, a job like this doesn't require a emotions."
good,"I had a great time at SWA. But after going on maternity leave, I feel like I had no more place there. It was sad to see it transform into this corporate rat race in the 6 years I was there. However, I made lifelong friends. I was loyal to my team and boss but now that I look back on it, I feel like I had 6 years of my career advancement stolen."
good,"extremely physically taxing. not worth the pay.Over all i would not recommend working for this company. they pushed my doctors to send me back to work when i was injured. this led to further injury, resulting in a permanent partial disability in my right knee."
good,Most departments strive really hard to maintain the SWA culture.  You can make a new friend everyday if you really want to.  The Headquarter campus is set up in a comfortable modern design which is very pretty and well maintained.
good,clock in and look up what gate you were assigned to and job type  then look up the computer to see what time your planes arrived then wait until planes got there or help out other gates.I learned that job that were laid back were not always good for me didnt like to sit in break room and wait all day had to keep moving around. management was same as all job and some good ones and some had different point of views with employees. workculture was great and enjoyed to work. hardest part of day would be the weather but you got used to it. probably pushed and tow in aircraft . I really enjoyed the employees they would look after on another and they always had bbq.
good,Good place to work and a great career to grow into. Company benefits and by far the best in the industry . I would highly recommend someone to take a job in this company
good,Southwest is a great company if you are flexible and can put your job first. If you are a student or have a family where you’re needing to be home then it may not be a great fit unless you’re able to balance work and personal life effectively. I worked call center and did the whole shift bid which didn’t work out for my family so I had to unfortunately leave but once my family is less dependent of me I will be going back.
good,Worked the ramp. It wasnt hard but it takes a toll on your body over time. Im 25 and feel like im 40 from that job. Hours are crazy. Very far from a 9 to 5.
good,"Southwest has been known as the LUV airline since its inception - and that was an applicable adjective for the first 30 or so years of its existence.  But as the Company has grown, upper-level management has changed and now believes (by behavior, not be promotion) profits take precedence over People.  In business, change is inevitable - especially if you want to grow and expand your business.  But you can change your technology, change your practices, change your procedures without having to change your values.  And that's where we've missed the mark the last 10-ish years.  Herb Kelleher used to say that we are not in the airline business, we're in the Customer Service business - we just happen to fly planes.  The Company motto, core value was that People came first (employees then customers, believing that if you take care of your employees they will take care of your customers).  And it worked! We've grown exponentially to become the largest domestic carrier in the US. We've been a model in business classes, schools as a great, underdog success story. The ultimate David versus (at the time) 3 Goliaths (American, United, Delta). And while they were all filing for bankruptcy protection and laying people off, Southwest was hiring people and making large profits. We're now the American Goliath.  But if you now look at our Mission Statement, our core values, Customer Service is nowhere to be found. We are now most definitely an airline, in the money-making business. Granted, people are in business to make money - and there's nothing wrong with making money. But is it ethical (much"
good,"Poor Team environment - lack of collaboration and cohesion on the Team. Poor attitudes towards each other and lack of trust"
good,Being on probation is hard when you have days till you become a permanent employee and they rip the rug from underneath you. Did not have a pleasant experience here.
good,"Working at Southwest is good and bad. The good is that you can work as much or as little as you want. However, it is hard to move up in the company because the ramp is the largest work group and most demanding. Also, there are a multitude of personalities that a person has to deal with that could be to the benefit and detriment of a ramp worker. But the greatest benefit is the ability to fly whenever you want to."
good,"SWA is a great company, great culture, great concepts, with great flight benefits.  Nonetheless, most of the managers are just ok at their job.  There are many layers to the issues the company has, but it starts with the leaders.  People don't leave companies they leave leaders."
good,"I was not happy as a person trying to raise a family the rate of pay and they type of work you have to go trough at Southwest Airlines.  There was no way I would be able to afford to live and pay for a family off what Southwest was giving me,."
good,Seniority based job and schedule take a toll on any life / work balance...I had no life outside this job while i worked for them.  And harrassment is prevalant.
good,"Southwest Airlines has pros and cons. The benefits are great (401k, profit sharing, flight benefits), but some of the rules and policies are unnecessary and too strict."
good,"Over all the company is a great company to work for, but my typical day was compelled of meetings and conference calls.  Depending on your Leaders, your work/life balance can become very challenging. If  one finds the right niche and the right leaders, the sky is the limit.  I did enjoy the travel, but it seem redundant and too much with so much work lying in the balance."
good,great company unfortunately if you're not a flight attendant mechanic or pilot consider a different career path. lack of transferable skills no tuition reimbursement
good,"The management is poorly trained(on the job), the union workers and non-union workers don't work as a team, I didn't learn much as the job wasn't overly technical, the hardest part of the job was working enough hours to get a good sized check and the most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits."
good,"Seniority based very hard to work with , overall phoenix management unable to work productively with unions and supervisors."
good,"My work consisted of providing service to customers for pets, bags problems and personalitites. I learned that the hardest part and the easiest part of the job are what you make it."
good,"since im working here i have no issues and no restriction on my work and all my team mates ate really nice and caring people, we enjoy our work and feel growing"
good,I was not there long enough due to the cut on hours to give a full review. apply and see for yourself. I know some people who got a great position and enjoy it.
good,"Very intense, high stress environment. Tough micromanaging. Challenging Customers.I wouldn't recommend it for the weak. Call center experience is a must."
good,"Supervisors for both Ramp and CSA’s lack management skills"
good,The safety of over 100 passengers per flight was my responsibility. The pressure was always on because I had to give the final pass on whether or not the plane could leave the gate.
good,Didn't like how management handle my issue i  felt abandon.  I really enjoyed my job. However management treated me really badly from Chicago to Atlanta the only one that was really fair was in Albuquerque NM
good,"I don't want to give a review of the company - but overall was ok to work for. I enjoyed the benefits, and the experience was nice and enjoyable. Could of been better as in the way it is ran."
good,"Constantly would make you stay for mandatory overtime. If you had plans after working your shift, forget about it and just cancel them now. The pay was pathetic considering you had to work out in the elements, no matter what was going on. They had a parking lot miles away for employees to park and pay out of pocket for the parking as well and the bus system added almost 30 minutes to your commute because the parking lot was so far away."
good,"Its a good company with a union, a lot more then throwing bags."
good,"Working on the ramp, ensuring that the customer luggage is secure and being delivered in a timely manner. Loading and unloading luggage and transporting to various terminals."
good,Does not take care of employees when they are hurt! Will find ways to let you go after you are hurt! All they care about is money. Please do not drink the kool aid .
good,"We all have pros and cons.  Individual management makes or breaks the experience."
good,"Every day brought about new challenges, therefore, individuals must be proficient in task management."
good,Image over reality tends to reduce trust and destroy the team from within. I loved working with certain people and I learned a lot from them as well. Trust and loyalty are the core principles of my daily work ethic and I have found that it is slowly becoming a lost art in corporate america.
good,"Southwest can be an amazing and fun experience! Im grateful for the opportunity the company gave to improve my people skills and  my adaptability However, If you are family oriented this company may not be the right match. The long mandatory hours, bidding for shifts every other month, and not always getting your vacation approved was disheartening for me. Also, call center enviornment was rigoursly micro managed and direct supervisors were always underpressure and not paid as much as the individuals they managed. If you're single, like to travel, and dont have to make it to regular extracurricular activities for your kids, or reservations with spouse Go for it!!!"
good,At Southwest Airlines we are loading and unloading all personnel  baggage on/off airplane and taking them to the retrieving for the exiting passengers
good,"I worked for Southwest as a Flight Attendant and my typical started by checking in on the Computer in the crew room for Reserve or a actual trip.  The workplace culture is cut throat and you never really know who is genuine or not. I loved the flying part and dont get me wrong there are some great people there. The unfortunate thing are the peer evaluations that are used to evaluate your performance however some people used these evaluations as means to threaten you if you did not do what they wanted you too do while inflight. If they did not like you of course you were reviewed in a poor manner which was used against you while on probation and could actually your employment with the company. I had a Great Manager however make sure you get things documented or signed or their stories change as well as far as being absent ""oh thats not gonna be held against you"". The hardest part of the job were flying with bitter and mean Flight Attendant who wanted the ""Old Southwest Back"" and they made it extremely hard for you to do your job and constantly criticized or threatened your or said nothing only for you to get a bad peer evaluation. I would recommend they stop using those evaluations and put Inflight Management on the aircraft instead of believing what some of the Crewmembers say. I enjoyed some Great People there however the bad outweighed the good. I do believe there is work to be done however the benefits were great and I will still say there are some good people there. I have moved on to another Company. I wish Southwest much luck. Not a bitter person, it was a learning experience"
good,"Please don't mess with those who have been here for years and don't want the company to truly move past 1970. They don't like being asked to do more than they have in the past 20 years. If you do come to this place with a good work ethic, know that there will be a portion of workers who are not happy with you as you are making them look bad. Just be mediocre, at best. That is the way to stay unnoticed. Such a shame, because the people flying and servicing the aircraft, and on the ground are GREAT people."
good,"The best part of working there was the travel and health benefits.  The pay was not good.  Management were ok, but not very willing to help make the center a happy place.  You just go do your job, and leave.  There is the potential of working additional shifts if you want them.  The hardest part of working there was realizing that you weren't making any money."
good,"Busy, a lot about the people, management okay, culture was poor and the hardest part about the job was dealing with the senior employees, I enjoyed my job"
good,very fast paced. You will be on your feet for 8+ hours a day. Dealing with sometimes bad weather and passengers that do not understand why other flights may not leave during the bad weather. Lots of weight and balance issues to try and get the plane safely in line Anacortes to all the FA are regulations.
good,Worked here early on in my career. The job was interested and competitive. The job required a lot of out door work environments. OT was often mandated due to bad weather conditions.
good,"The application we supported was 15 years old and "
good,Just another job anyone is capable of doing as far as I am concerned. You just need to the time and the patience to do the job and eventually everything falls into place
good,"Lifted baggage of 20-60lbs regurlarly, worked outside in the elements. Some supervisors are not looking out for your welfare. Can be a fun job. Risk for injury is high."
good,Workplace is potentially a very good place to work. They try to have community culture events as an appreciation to their employees.  They remember birthdays.  One nice thing about the job as an employee of Southwest you can get flight privileges.  Hiregenics is a pretty goo Temp Agency.  They just don't give all of the benefits that permanent Southwest employees get.
good,"A typical day is never typical because something new always happens on each trip. I have learned to be flexible. The work culture is usually pretty good, although as of late, has suffered a bit because of lack of communication between headquarters and the frontline workers. For me the hardest part of my job is commuting and the best part is working with the passengers."
good,"Southwest of yesteryear is no more. The fun loving culture of Southwest was great when the company was small and manageable. With the boom in employment and the ""no lay off"" culture of SWA, you are left with a growing trend of bad people managers that treat well intentioned hard workers terriby. It's fun and carefree that quickly turns into practical jokes, hurtful teasing and a rather confusing atmosphere where friendship and professionalism is a blurry line. Don't get me wrong, not every department experiences this type of atmosphere and there are many departments that have been able to thrive in the changing atmosphere. Just be sure to interview the hiring manager while they are interviewing you."
good,they work you harder than needed. the hours are terrible. its a seniority job so the older workers really don't care cause they feel they did it before so you should be able to.
good,answering escalated phone calls from upset travelers was the hardest part of the job.  by the time they got to me they were pretty upset at the situation.  Although given tools to assist the day was very draining along with having to meet certain metrics on a daily basis. Co-Workers were great to work with.  the company started to make changes to become a bigger player in the industry and the culture became less important than the numbers.
good,"Company is building into a bigger larger family and I am happy to be a key part of that growth. Sourcing to find the best candidate to join the team, prepping them for joining the Southwest Airlines culture and motivating the long term goals of the company."
good,"The work is very stimulating and multi-faceted. The main part of our job is boarding customers onto airplanes, which is where 100% of the customer contact in this job happens. This is by far the most stressful part of the job. People try the same old tricks to circumvent the boarding process. Some get through, which irritates the passengers who paid a lot of money to board first. Once you're done boarding customers, you'll complete the weight and balance worksheets in accordance with FAA regulations."
good,"Working at Southwest was a dream come true. In 2011 the company was very much about its people, and its famous luv culture. I worked in the contact center in Albuquerque, NM. Its very much like being a part of a family. Management on the other hand had moved on and started to be more corporate, as directed by Dallas, and became cold and uninterested in the employee, and their unions needs. They turned the reservations centers into Sales, requiring we sell addition services and products. Even if the customer advised they didn't want any ""Sales Pitches."" The environment became hostile, it was them versus us. I loved helping people get to where they needed to be and connect them to what matters most to them, their loved ones and business. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who have an issue with how the company works, and operates. Essentially trying to please a customer that someone at my level has no control over or ability to change anything."
good,"IT Business Analyst"
good,"Everyday is a different day. The only constant thing was change. I mean that in a good way! You were always busy with something thing to do. There was never a dull moment. My coworkers were always there to lend a helping hand, that's just how they do it at Southwest. I can't really say there was a hardest part to the job because I had support system wide. There was always someone there to help. The most enjoyable part of my day was just coming into work everyday being with my family, yes it felt like being with family when I came to work!"
good,"Answering incoming calls from passengers wanting prices on flights, or to make changes to a current flight. I've learned to never underestimate the difference one person can make."
good,It is a company that you acan grow in but is a company that you can also get quickly fired and replaces in . The people of southwest airways are as friendly as they come. They allow you to grow within the company as well as try new positions out when ever your are ready. I loved working with southwest airways they are a good company to work for as well as fly with. I stated below limited supply inemployee hand books i say this because when you move up withinn the company ther are diffefent security measures that are present they wont tell untillthey are going to fire you.
good,"Fun company overall, but technically not challenging. Social commitments outside of work are highly valued, such as happy hours and intern events. Going above and beyond your work responsibilities are noticed with other groups, but can be overlooked by your manager. Company is looking for culture fits more than hard workers."
good,"Working at Southwest is good and bad. The good is that you can work as much or as little as you want. However, it is hard to move up in the company because the ramp is the largest work group and most demanding. Also, there are a multitude of personalities that a person has to deal with that could be to the benefit and detriment of a ramp worker. But the greatest benefit is the ability to fly whenever you want to."
good,I worked as a ramp agent in all weather conditions as that was a challenge especially in cold weather. The hours were not set so i was on the clock for ten hours then had to come back to work 6 hrs later because i was a new hire.But overall it was a nice place to work especially flying fir free but i wanted to pursue higher education.
good,The job is very enjoyable and the people are fantastic but the expectation pit in you are high as far as a schedule. They pretty much have control of your life with the current use of mandatory overtime which is a lot. It is always last minute and required very difficult to plan anything even doctor appointments because the mando hammer is waiting to fall
good,Good company to work for with wonderful benefits. They do Micromanage in the Call Center. Which is extremely stressful. It made you insecure about keeping your job.
good,"I really enjoyed talking with the passengers before they took their flight.  I'm a people person and love meeting people. Management however, was not the best.  My training was not the greatest.  Did not enjoy a different trainer everyday."
good,The job itself is not difficult and the company seems to really care about the customers and employees. The compensation is really good you get a lot of raises and the free passes are a really good perk. The schedule however is horrible especially when you first start.
good,"Be on time, make your quota of sales, be polite and very customer service friendly, adhere to all goals, and do what is asked/required from your Leader assigned to you"
good,"The technology department uses a lot of old technologies and tools. The code isn’t documented well at all so it’s hard to pick up for people new to a code base. There are far too many contractors who do work then leave, leading to discontinuity of code. The benefits are outstanding, but tech feels like it’s so far behind."
good,Loved my job but operations on a daily basis are mis managed and run horribly. Entire ramp group is dissatisfied and disappointed with how it's run! Used to be awesome til change of ownership!
good,"Southwest Airlines has a great work culture. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you.  The pay is very low, but the employees are happy to work there.  The advancement is also very slow, regardless of how much experience you have.  You have to pay your dues.  The schedule can be tough as well, but that is the airline industry as a whole.  If you want a day off it can be pretty easy to trade with someone else.  The hardest part of the job is when you have mandatory overtime on a day to day basis.  Customers get angry and you are already exhausted from working long hours."
good,Good company for getting trained and working hard. Learn what you can. They do not pay over time. Contract work only and no benefits. Very strict with company policy. They make you work all 3 shifts. Hard to balance work with personal life. Very demanding.
good,"Great team collaboration, Productive, interesting, great environment, and a fun place to work.  Especially when you are in the right department with a good leadership team"
good,Working environment was very free-spirited. Relaxed dress code. Never had to stress over what to wear as long as the clothing was appropriate.  Monthly departmental activities to keep employee morale up.
good,I worked from 4:00am to 3:00pm. It was difficult to have an outside life because being so worn out. Usually worked my days off. My department was very stressful.  We had to have the data input asap so everyone had access to records.
good,Direct Leaders take no interest in your advancement and have no action plan for you to advance.  There is no direction.  You are just expected to come in and do the work without any acknowledgement or recognition.
good,"in my initial days I felt I need some time to get along with the environment, job role, and my work. But as the days passed I could really feel comfortable  working with Southwest. Management is really the sweeter part. Work place culture its like more of adaptability that would you take, as the tasks may be different with each activity we regularly encounter with. Sometimes, we face bit kind of difficult scenarios where we feel the tasks consume more time than the fixed deadlines. It impacts a noticeable time. But I really loved the role as it  made me learn my development career in different direction which was positively challenging"
good,Management isn't the best and the CEO is only worried about the bottom line. The benefits are good for the most part. The job itself is high stress. You deal with a lot of angry passengers most of the time.
good,"They like to hire young and cheap. If you're an older resource looking to start as a contractor and then move into a full-time role, forget it. Only place I ever worked as a contractor where they referred to be as an ""outsider"" to my face."
good,"Not a good job if you are raising a family. Pay is small and hours are long. Pace is very hectic and the job is very time consuming. You cannot call out for any reason, so if you have kids, this is not a good job area for you"
good,"in reservations the morale is soo low"
good,Southwest is good job to have. I would recommend for anyone looking for a good payingn entry level job. They also have great benefits and then have a union.
good,They can be a certain way when it comes to your health. Just make sure that you protect yourself from certain people of you'll be out of a job just like I wash laid off.
good,"Southwest is a good Company. They do have amazing benefits. The Call Center however, is a very stressful job and extremely  micromanaged. Good news is if you can make it a year, you can look into other job openings in the company."
good,"Great People, Team and Leaders"
good,"Lots of people say they work at Southwest for the lifestyle... and they're absolutely right, because they're not in it for the money, at least not if they're a flight attendant."
good,"At SWA I learned a great deal about logistics and resolving operational issues. I also was a leader of roughly 18-23 people a day. I learned many managerial, administrative, and operational skills in my time at Southwest."
good,"When I first started, the job was great; I enjoyed working there. the benefits are greater, you fly for free. now over the past year, management has changed dramatically for the worse, and the moral is very low. They go through supervisors more than agents, due to no union representation."
good,"Overall the work culture in the company has been good. Helping co-worker, approachable management."
good,"If you can get through the first six months, you should be okay. While the pay is not great, the benefits are. However there is not much advancement if you work in the customer centers and unless ou plan to move to corporate in Texas chances are you will not get off the customer center floor unless you want to become a Team Lead, which the pay is not great and the job is more demanding than being on the customer center floor. When they say they work hard and play hard, they truly mean it!"
good,"Southwest has an amazing culture and amazing benefits if that's what you are looking for.  Your overall pay is less, but is a result of the benefits and perks.  While the culture is amazing and almost cult-like, departmental management leaves a lot to be desired.  Sadly, it is very much a 'good-old boy' system and is not open to catching up with the times.  There is zero flexibility when it comes to work/life balance and work from home was erased before it even started. Also, vacation is accrued at a snails pace and don't expect to get more than a week off per year until you've been at the company at least 5 years."
good,"The station I worked at was very much like high school again and, working on the ramp that happens in almost any station. The company didnt pay the lower people well but flight attendants and pilots had it made."
good,"Fun company to work for, full of diversity and culturally rich, however culture is a double edged sword.  As a consequence change and adoption of change is a slow hampered with meetings for inclusion and decisions."
good,"The job is great if you don't have kids, especially young kids or value a healthy balance of work and life. The hours are unpredictable, you never know how long you will be there, unless you're really high up in seniority. REALLY high up. The people that is high seniority stay, because they're at top dollar, but hate how the company has changed and doesn't value its employees. The younger crew usually wants something extremely easy (after proper training) and are focused only on making it back to the break room as soon as possible. Its harder for those with families, second jobs, and schooling, which they  do everything to tell you is still possible to sustain with this job. You HAVE to take mandatory overtime that you can't say no to without receiving a point on your record. It can be on your scheduled day off, 5 minutes before you have to clock out, or over night (if you have night shift). Employees feel extremely entitled and complain a lot, which can get to you if you're trying to do your best at your job and stay positive. With this union job, its not uncommon for employees to walk away from active jobs, even if a plane is boarding, if they feel they are wronged by the management or if something goes against any union rule that supports them. "
good,Watch who you trust and the rules that are put into place. They are for your safety but to actually cover themselves if they were to target and pursue you in a manner that is unfitting.
good,it was a pleasure working for the company i feel like they work stuborn at times and managment wouldnt put them selves in rampers shoes but overall i enjoyed my time with fellow Co-Hearts
good,"A typical day at SW airlines , I was dealing with customers who had issues with their flights due to needing to reschedule or plan needing assistance with booking a flight."
good,"I do not have any comment for this section.W do not have any feedback to provide. Nice people, flexible, unorganized, no accountability. Although the nicest people you will ever meet."
good,"Southwest has provided some of the best perks and work family I could have ever asked for.  benefits are top notch, as long as you don't mind the long hours, and occasional stress"
good,fun company good people to be around don't be late cool go workers managers are all fun hard to get off the line with customers or for them to advance you
good,Just needs better management. Everyone was fun to work with daily. Active and hands on. Great benefits. Managers were never on the same page and things became erratic and crazy when they would try too get back on the same page.
good,"The people who work for the company are great people, and always have a smiles on their faces.  It is a great environment to be in.  However,  the airlines industry is very unpredictable, and you always have to be prepared for anything!"
good,"Southwest does an excellent job on hiring good, dedicated, caring people."
good,Great company to work for 401K is he best I’ve ever seen. But having worked for other major carriers previously they just seemed to do everything the hard way during my time there another supervisor that I worked with got tired of it and went  back to his previous airline because he got tired of the position at Southwest.
good,"I do not want to respond about this via the internet. Please ask me any questions you have about my experiences or my company personally. "
good,"The environment is hustle and  bustle, very stressful most agents are very nice and kind family environment, New management at LAX specifically has ruined the friendliness and everyone either leaves, or transfers as they are unfair most times."
good,"Working at Southwest was awarding. I received great benefits and had the opportunity to travel to places I never been, but you will work stressful long hours for those wonderful benefits with low pay. Customers will scream and yell. You will have to work mandatory overtime, so I suggest you do not pick up doubles during high peak times and bad weather. You will definitely receive great recognition from other organization with Southwest on your resume. The workplace is a friendly loving environment, far as with the staff. I was able to graduate with a college degree and still work at the same time, due to the flexible hours you can work. I was able to buddy bid with another employee working 2 days of doubles and off a extra  days just so I can attend school."
good,"Worked very hard non stop"
good,"Job security good. Starting pay is to low. I would have stayed if I got 14 to 15 to start.They pay very well eventually,but it takes years to get there. "
good,"Great people to work with. Fun company. My only disappointment was the job I was told I would do and the shift I was told I would work changed from the interview to the hiring date. I was put under a great deal of responsibility and workload for a new person. I feel management should have seen the unrealistic workload and should have a better training curve put in place. I did find out that after I resigned, 7 positions were opened up in the shop. I feel this says it all."
good,"Came in checked in went right to the position assigned. Started working with passenger checking in and checking baggage, paying any fees such as extra bags, dogs in flight, wheelchairs for disabled persons"
good,"Very good rewarding job.. only drawback is as a new hire, u are expected to pull 5x the the weight of your senior counterparts, for the simple fact they are protected by the union and your not"
good,Traveling was a plus. Management always changing. Not very compassionate about their employees. Didn't appreciate dedicated employees. Didn't pay attention to details.
good,"Long hours, with low pay.  Not worth the commute.  Flight benefits are useless if you can't get time off. Had to work a shift, then report back four hours later. Also had to push wheelchairs and physically pick up obese disabled people and help them to their seats. Not in the Ops Agent job description. Very disappointed."
good,This job has its ups and downs. The benefits and perks are the best I ever had. But the schedule changes daily and its hard trying to plan your life.
good,"I loved working for SWA.  I lead a team of 20 people in Customer Relations.  I worked with them to meet the Company metrics, recurrent training and career planning.  The hardest part of the job was working with other Team Leaders who has been there with the company for a very long time.  The best part was working with the Reps.  They are awesome.  I enjoyed helping them with their everyday work flow and encouraged them with positive feedback.  Our Customers were pretty great also."
good,"Southwest airlines is a very interesting place to work there is so much to learn about the airline industry.  A typical date at work may consist of inbound customer service.  Assisting customers with questions about the website, booking and canceling flights, locating luggage, booking and canceling hotel reservations, group rates, rental vehicles, children and senior discount rates, pets, and weather related delays."
good,"I was there for a short period if time as I wanted to travel the world, though if I had stayed I would have transferred to their in-flight department. They have a great culture and truly take care of their employees who stay with them for the long haul."
good,"Overall a very stable place to work. You will receive good pay, and excellent benefits. However for me Southwest was not a fit. They emphasize ""Culture"" which ends up feeling much more like CULTure a.k.a. a Cult.  I never felt a genuine concern from fellow employees or management, although many others who work there would say there is. There is definitely a lack of diversity. Which they now have diversity training. However, it is in the beginning stages, and was noyyet mandatory for everyone prior to my leaving."
good,If you have a family especially younger children this isn’t the job for you. Very great company with lots of room for advancement and wonderful being it’s but it’s very demanding if you want to keep a job.
good,"It was very rewarding and challenging position.  Our team was very busy scheduling training.  The hardest part of this position was the amount of work divided between a team of 5 to provide training support for a company with 65,000+ employees.  My team members were the most enjoyable part of my job. I had a wonderful team."
good,"If you like to work with your hand its your job, I really cant stay to much it was a job for poeple that do not like to improve themselves, it was easy and quick."
good,Working at the airport is fast paced and exciting. It's hard work but very rewarding. I've learned all about safety regulations and requirements for loading and off loading airplanes and working at the airport.
good,It was a call center. The phones would basically ring nonstop but you helped people make hotel reservations and sell tickets to local events. As a supervisor I monitored phone calls to insure that all callers were getting the service and attention they deserved.
good,"The company has been around for 48 years, since 1971, and was a smaller more personable company. Now it is a fast growing company with several changes."
good,work hard and treat people like I want to be treated wonderful retirement plans and love to travel and explore different cultures and lifestyles. many options
good,"Fast work pace, but safe and management needs a bit improvement but overall great work place"
good,I enjoy my current job because I am a people person and I like solving peoples issues.
good,"Working in the Corporate office in Dallas or as a flight attendant appears to be the greatest experience ever.  However, working at certain call centers  or airport locations can provide a totally different experience. The culture in the call centers and airport  is not the same as what is taught by the corporate office.  The income and benefits are great.  The opportunities to change departments and relocate are good as well.  However working in the call center  or the airport is not ideal."
good,"Great people to work with, however the new regime of Technology management is not qualified to lead the department.   It's definitely who you know, not what you know to get ahead in this company."
good,It is a very fast paced atmosphere one day something will be right the next day it will be wrong and it's a you scratch my back I scratch your back type of atmosphere not great
good,"Overall Southwest Airlines is a great company to work for. What will determine your level of enjoyment is the station you're working in. Midway Airport, during my time of employment, didn't have a good management team in place. There was a severe lack of communication among one another, and no proactive measures taken during weather events. Having traveled and worked in other stations across the country, this is not the culture of the company."
good,"hectic"
good,"Working required overtime to get a good pay. Work hard to take care of each passenger to make them feel special, especially handicap customers.  There is endless opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,Good company to work for if you like that type of lifestyle.  The pay is not that great but they have really good benefits. A typical day at work would be making sure that the weight and balance is correct for the aircraft to fly.
good,You fly for free and that is amazing!! :-) You make life long friends and they do tons of hiring from within. Once you are in the company you are free to move about the company. I will say it's all about who you know with this company and not at all about skill or ability to preform job functions.
good,"Great coworkers. Management is spread thin, they deal with a lot but they also ask for a lot from folks physically. Sometimes supervisors are inconsistent."
good,Great company. Just depends on where you are in life and what you have going on. The company do love there staff in ways. They show compassion. They are Southwest.
good,"scheduling time and enough money to take advantage of the flight privileges where a challenge. Management was under a lot of pressure the maintain ""ON TIME PERFORMANCE"". This stress "
good,"A typical day at Southwest for Operations agent is coming to see how many flights you have to work for the day. Being in DCA (Reagan National) You had about 4 flights a day. Once you get the number of flights for the day you start getting your paperwork ready for the first flight if it is ready. Hardest part of the job are delays or full flights on and off as time is of essence, especially with crew switches. I learned alot of behind the scenes stuff at Southwest, what all it takes for a successful flight. The workplace culture was amazing, Minus one Operations Supervisor and One Assistant manager it was one of the best places Ive worked. Southwest did a lot to celebrate employees and had fun days. The only thing I would say is that if you need to transfer to another airport its not always smooth."
good,I don't think it's a bad company but my station is horrible. Management dont know what they're doing. They're also very sneaky. Im sure it may be better at other stations.
good,"Responsible for physical safety and security of mall customers, employees, and property. Responsible for creating and implementing security programs that fit the requirements of the mall environment with specific attention to various internal investigations. Supervised 40 officers and five lieutenants to ensure adherence to all laws, ordinances, and policies."
good,Working within an environment of to much workplace romance makes for a toxic environment in management wife's husband girlfriend boyfriends and partnerships  is way to much for this outsider.
good,SWA is a great job with great people and you learn something everyday. Helping people from different backgrounds and making people smile is what they specialize in. Great group of people to be around.
good,Southwest is a fun-loving company with great benefits. A typical day at work would include building schedules and reconciling payroll. The hardest part of the job would be building staffing tools. The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-hearts.
good,"Great Company to work for , but like anywhere else it has it moments, sometime you don't get to see your family very often. (mostly at the station i worked at), overall the company i really looks out for it people."
good,"I had to find a job that was more 9-5 I was adopting my twin grandchildren.  I had to think long and hard about leaving many great relationships formed, but I needed the consistency of 9-5 for them, my grandchildren."
good,"Fast paced airport customer service.  Check-in, ticketing, boarding of flights.  Sometimes very long hours due to delays or mandatory overtime.  Fun place to work, very fun culture."
good,"It was ok. Good culture for employees, not contractors. Lots of people everywhere doing all sorts of things. Pay was poor as an employee and the commute to love field every day was tough. Great opportunity."
good,"Contractors, such as myself, were really only able to get hired full-time by applying for internal jobs myself, not being promoted by management.  Work environment was ok, but I definitely felt like a contractor while I was there.  Not my best experience."
good,"Checking daily schedule to make sure we were staffed for the day"
good,My supervisor was awesome.  I loved the people I worked with.  The only negative thing I have to say is that they hire contractors for the Service Desk rather than employees.  No benefits or vacation time.
good,"Very busy operation. Must be flexible, its a 24 hour operation. During peak times lots of mandatory overtime. Everything is processed for seniority. Good Place to work."
good,I learned a lot about the aviation industry working for this company. Met a lot of great people who love what they do and overall the atmosphere makes the work day a breeze.
good,"Your typical work-day consists of working flight after flight each day, which takes a lot of energy. After working your flights you retire to a hotel in a different city each day."
good,flying free and shift trading are the only good things about this job. working in the hot sun and the freezing cold is the worst. the airport never closes so holidays off is nothing but a dream.
good,"A typical day at Southwest is relaxed without any dress code. You are given daily, monthly & quarterly assignments that are to be completed in a timely manner. Some assignments are more time consuming than others but thats where good personal time management comes into place."
good,The Work With You And Help You When Needed But The Managment Was Really Bad.
good,1.Review your load factors
good,Very hard to get hired from a contractor to full employment. They just want to keep you there without ever hiring you on permanently..Too many people not able to get over that challenge.
good,As reservations agent for Southwest Airlines you work in a call center environment. Here you will find diversity and collaboration. Southwest Airlines sets up their agents to be successful. The environment is fast paced and there is always something new to learn. Communication is always open with leadership. There are metrics to be met and customer service is the goal. All shifts are available and bids are based on seniority. Work - Life balance is a struggle to achieve but it can be done.
good,"Southwest Airlines as a whole is amazing! Unfortunately for me, I chose to work in Laguardia, NY because they don't have a location in JFK. Gossip and morale was terrible. You had your typical cliches and your favorites. If you have no choice to work in that location my advice to you is keep your head down and your mouth shut until you get into the union."
good,"People are amazing, legitimately curious about how you're doing and want to help you. Airline work can be a bit of a drag inherently, ex. maintenance documents, FAA, etc."
good,"Southwest is a fun LUVing company to work for and very diverse yet inclusive. It feels like family. Great perks and discounts as well. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a quick paced, fun career."
good,"Hard work but rewarding.  Lots of different personalities and job roles to work with.  Great people. Long hours and days  consistently."
good,It is a great place to start your career and a fun atmosphere. The benefits are good. I am over the age of 30 and want to make more money. There is lots of opportunity for working overtime if you want to sacrifice your life to the job.
good,The pay and benefits at Southwest are among the best in the industry. The working conditions for those covered under collective bargaining agreements are good. The working conditions for non-contract Supervisors is not ideal due to extensive mandatory overtime which is paid at a lower rate than the employees covered under labor agreements. Ramp Agents are paid double pay for mandatory overtime while Supervisors are paid at time and a half. Management varies from station to station however Atlanta is not considered among the best. Management is not positively engaged in the operation. The most difficult part of the job is under staffing at gates above and below the wing.
good,"SWA is an incredible place to work, I was employed for nearly 10 years and was overall very happy there. Unfortunately, an opportunity came up utside the Company that offered me growth opportunities SWA was unable to. Leadership is about 50/50 as in most places. SWA tries to foster a great Leadership Style but there are some less than stellar Leaders within the Company as I can imagine is true for most larger Companies. I was lucky to have mostly really wonderful Leaders with a few less than desirable ones sprinkled in here and there. Culture is great, People are great, benefits are nice, overall depending on your skills you can make an amazing career at SWA. Executive Level Leaders were amazing, I had a lot of fun, built amazing relationships, and gained experience at SWA and still, and will always browse their Open Jobs to see if anything will call me back home."
good,"I actually worked as a contractor for Southwest, because the airport in RVA is so small. So the only downside, to me, was not being a full SW employee"
good,"I was brought in as a supervisor to replace retiring members in leadership. I thought it was cool at first until I found out why they couldn’t promote internally. Leadership needs a complete sweep, the agents are the ones who actually run that airlines. They’re better taken care of, unionized and everything is based off seniority. Mangement is completely opposite, no 10 rest rule and direct turnaround on shifts majority of the time. I’ve worked at least a months worth of 24hr shifts within a year of being with SWA. Culturewise, it’s a great company, but at the actual airport stations, the morale is low, harassment, favoritism and racial profiling left and right. Work at HQ in Dallas if you would like to pursue a career with them."
good,Dear god some of the people here are lets say special and do not give to cares in the world about anything other than sitting on there phone all day long
good,Good place to work if you are young and are flexible. The crazy hours and low start out pay can get challenging. Once you put your time in it gets better. Management needs improvement. The union environment gets old really quick.
good,Too much job responsibility delegation by employees for focus on personal travel and office party planning. Engineering department  staffing work assignment priorities were poor for the amount of aircraft DTA substantiation work required by FAA with deadlines dates approaching.
good,"Come to work with your mind focused to keep peace.  Everyday is different and is all about perception but even then because of the volume of people you work around, that perception will always be skewed."
good,"Working for Southwest has been a great opportunity to continue to grow in my role as well as the industry. We have the ability to interact with different levels of management and bring fresh ideas to the table. We're encouraged to participate, problem solve and provide process improvements.  "
good,"A typical workday at Southwest was great for me to say the least.  I enjoyed what I did.  I put my all into all positions I held at Southwest Airlines.  I learned self control, patience, importance of safety and equipment.  The culture at Southwest could use improvement, but for the most part what you put into your career is what u get out of it.  Management for the most part works with individuals and helps them to accomplish their set goals.  There wasn't really anything hard about the job, but on some days fatigue would settle in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and being kind to others.  Always having a smile on your face no matter the situation, goes a long way"
good,This company environment was awesome. We had a wonderful time working together and more importantly I learnt a lot during my tenure at this company. Given a chance I'll go back.
good,Southwest airlines in the beginning it was a great place to work once they change the Ceo and bought Air Tran it change completely after 23yrs 10months they decided they no longer wanted there senior agent who help to build that company and make it what it is today the thanks we get is they are forcing us out and hiring new agents at a lower rate sad.
good,Southwest is a great company. I have learned plenty of communication skills and software skills. Management goes out of their way to be sure employees are satisfied with their environment.
good,"Southwest Airline is a great company to work for.  I enjoyed my 16+ years working for this company."
good,"The job was very fast pace, and detailed job . pretty easy work. the co-works are very helpful and kind . thats the reason for the 4 stars above ."
good,good company to work and everyone is jovial and also no work pressure and good team to support and encourages one another.
good,"Came in at a time when the company was undergoing major changes in its culture and philosophy. Southwest was founded on the principle of putting employees first, but it is shifting its emphasis toward one that places shareholder and investor interests above all else. A major merger with another airline was also underway at the time I hired in, and that has contributed to the cultural changes. "
good,"great fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff "
good,Intercepted mishandled traveler's calls from phone agents to better serve the customer. Listened to the caller's concerns and offered a solution in an effort to reconcile the situation.
good,"Completely different lifestyle"
good,Very busy office and constantly on the go.  I enjoy staying busy and doing several things at once.  This position required a lot of multitasking.
good,"Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) is a major U.S. airline and the world's largest low-cost carrier, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The airline was established in 1967[3] and adopted its current name in 1971.[4] The airline has nearly 46,000 employees as of December 2014 and operates more than 3,400 flights per day.[5] As of June 5, 2011, it carries the most domestic passengers of any U.S. airline.[6] As of November 2014, Southwest Airlines has scheduled service to 93 destinations in 41 states, Puerto Rico and abroad."
good,A wonderful place to work. I loved talking to and helping our employees throughout the transition from AirTran to Southwest Airlines.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a good company to work with, if you are willing to give up weekends and holidays.  Management really does try to work with you and tries to accommodate you. The only negative or unpopular thing that I am not to keen on is the 6 months of probation in which you to not have the backing of the Union.  Other wise it is a good company.  Also the starting salary is not the greatest."
good,"Learned leadership skills and ITIL training and certification"
good,"Family atmosphere,working along side beautiful hard working people who wants to make a difference for the company. Always looking for a new challenge"
good,"•	Created, managed & tracked tasks in project plan to keep project within schedule and budget "
good,Great place to work.  Managed a high volume call center with 18 direct reports.  Gained additional experience on how to multi task and organize priorities. Part of a great team in a high stress exciting and dynamic environment.  The most enjoyable was helping my staff make career choices.  The Helpdesk was a springboard for opportunities and part of my responsibility was to prepare the best of the best and provide an opportunity for them to move on.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours and keeping up with everything on a daily basis.
good,Great benefits and fun loving atmosphere. Flexible scheduling.Continuous training.
good,Awesome place to work!!!  Everyone works hard to make it the best airline in the industry.
good,Traveling all around country was awesome. My supervisor was great. Loading and unloading passengers servings snacks and beverages all while most importantly keeping passenger safety on the forefront. Hard work between flights tidying plane in quick amount of time. Loved the benefits and meeting all walks of life in the passengers aboard
good,"Very family orientated, colleagues look out for each other.  "
good,"People that enjoy a Military type setting would enjoy this job, it's not for me"
good,A typical day start's with punching in and greeting co-worker's as you pass them. I learned how an airline run's from the inside . Management is on a station by station basis as far as how your treated. You will work with a potpourri of people . The hardest part of the job is working on the ramp and getting off at the end of the day and depending on the weather your now able to decompress
good,"The company has gotten so large that at times, one is unable to see what their role is, when things go wrong. It is not perfect, but given its size, it does a good job communicating. Cooperation, understanding and team work between departments seems to need an overhaul."
good,"Job has various times and hours that you can work, by way of a bid process. Three areas to work ad a ramp agent, T-point, Ramp area, Provisioning, servicing the aircraft."
good,Hours does not make for great family time. Most overtime decision made are based on seniority. Flight benefits are ok pending the space availabilty. You are not aware of your boarding position until you are at the counter.
good,"Professionally: It is a premier company in the airline industry that hasn't lost too much of it's original tenacity from rapid and recent change. There's proven success for many on different operating levels, but the company's direction at times questions their longevity in the industry"
good,"amazing oppurtunity, if put in the right work environment. they set you up to succeed and there is lee way with certain things. get training and can relocate to anywhere in the United States that has an opening"
good,Help Desk at Southwest will hire you as a contractor for 3 years with no extension. Southwest help Desk has three shifts available. Three weeks paid training. Stand By flight perks.
good,"Southwest as a whole is a wonderful company to work for.  "
good,"too much drama, some of the hours are crazy when you are trying to travel and if your new, you are at the bottom of the list so you get the worst shifts. and no one wants to trade with you unless you pay them."
good,Trusted EEO employer.  They give everyone a fair chance based off of qualifications.  Company is extremely good about promoting from within.  Very flexible schedules to help with life-balance.
good,"Customer relations is like a typical call center, but much better. The management does well to run the operations and the culture is unmatched.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with."
good,"Very Productive and a fun place to work, flexibility.  Micromanaged company.  Learned about workplace motivation and work burnout.  Co-workers and customers are the most enjoyable about the job."
good,"Working for SWA used to be so much fun and family oriented but now you are just a number. Operations consist of the weight and balance of the aircraft for the pilots. unloading and loading passengers. Solving problems and customer issues among other things. Management is poor due to most of them don't know the positions they are in and don't want to learn, yet try to discipline you anyway. Hardest part is keeping up with FAA, TSA procedures and Irate customers, other than that the entire position is fun with never a dull moment."
good,I enjoyed my time at SWA.  It definitely encourages employees to work together and have fun.  They offered many employee perks and incentives. The environment is generally happy.
good,You are out in the elements much of your shift. Bags are heavy and the hours can get long. Flying for free is very good perk to this job. Many good times.
good,This was a decent place to work with a friendly customer service based environment. The management team is knowledgeable and helpful.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with the passengers and exhibit excellent customer service.
good,"Great company to work for, Very Poor MANAGEMENT. They will target you and make sure that you know that you're being targeted other than that great company and very family like."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of marshaling in aircrafts, then unloading and loading aircrafts. After it was loaded and ready for departure, my job was either to wing walk or push the aircraft out on a push back. If i wasn't working on the gates, I was bag running. This job was to bring bags either to baggage drop or to another aircraft."
good,Work with many great Internal and External people. Many great relationships built. It is fun to be put in the hot seat when things don't go as planned and have to figure out the best new course of action.
good,I was very Happy work at Southwest Airlines. Mainly I loved working  in Southwest.
good,"Responsible for providing leadership and strategic direction for six distinct work groups including Security, Compliance, Database Administration, Enterprise Insights Platforms and Software Configuration and Release Management. "
good,"Southwest Airlines is famous for their mantra: work hard...play harder. The atmosphere is often festive (seasonal decorations, costume parties, drawings for prizes). They believe in working hard to get the job done. Inbound calls whereby customers are needing assistance with reservations, billing, baggage and airport issues. Several applications available to make sure we have the answer to the customer's questions/needs. "
good,"great union and great perks such as free flights, steady increase in pay twice a year, flexible hours, management was not the best but I've heard its better at other stations"
good,Southwest empowers its employees to do what is right by our customers. This job can be quite fulfilling in this regard. Management also supports its employees decisions and values our judgment.
good,"I like the job, fast paced and free to roam about. plenty of availability to pick up shifts and give away shifts. I don't know about the management too much. The hardest part f the job is trying to get the planes out on time with the amount of bags that come off the plane."
good,Difficult to find work/life balance.  You can work as many hours as your want and able to get people to work for you  when needed.  Excellent travel benefits as you can fly for free on SWA and get huge discounts on other airlines
good,"80 hrs/week, mandatory OT. If you refuse the OT during probation they fire you. Worked @4:15 am to 12am the next day. They would give you 2.5 hours off at 1 pm to skirt the union rule, you can't work 16 consecutive hours.  The ALB is poorly managed and 70% of the supervisors are unapologetic about the crazy hours. I started with 15 people, only 4 made it thru the first 6 months."
good,Very old boys environment setting but also very good job security. It was very hard to get promoted coming in at a lower level employee because of said old boy culture. But the compensation can be good at times depending on your position.
good,"Southwest Airlines was a good place to work.Customers were happy, employees all supported each other and looked out for each other. We always made it through the hardest of times. I enjoyed the people I worked with and that made the hard times like irregular ops easier. We were all really like family. Benefits are great, insurance is great and inexpensive. Profit sharing and 401k match is excellent. They give you 10 free PTO'S a year. All great stuff. "
good,"Great Benefits, Hard for new hires that require a traditional schedule. Takes along time to reach liveable wage. Overtime is always available from others."
good,"Detailed interior and exterior of airplanes, learned more about aircraft parts and functions, bad management, job was quite relaxed and not hard, free flight benefits and other great benefits."
good,"Very fast paced work environment, customers are priority and use a lot of different tools to assist, high call volume, goal oriented company, some accounting with groups special department, use basic Microsoft word, excel and outlook"
good,"A typical work day being a operations agent at Midway Airport can be very busy and stressful. Some days you will work back to back flights, and short lunch breaks. I've learned the importance of weight and balance of the aircraft, how to fill out a fuel ticket, interacting with the flight deck crew, e.g pilots/flight attendants. Workplace culture is really nice. Sometimes the company feed you, whether it's pizza, soul food, Boston Market, etc., depending on which holiday or if the company receive 100% originator departures. The hardest part of the job is dealing with passengers with different personalities. Some are more demanding than others. Just do your job the correct way and go strictly by the book/your contract and you'll be just fine. The most enjoyable part of the job is you fly for free!!!"
good,Great people to work with.  Employees are taken care off;  the company does not eliminate roles but moves employees into a role where they can learn and succeed.  Some days are really busy as deadlines need to be met but teams do get a break in between projects.
good,"Other than poor management, enjoyed the job and fellow peers (co-hearts). Many opportunities for advancement but mainly at HDQ in Dallas Texas. Would like to see more sales opportunities in the Los Angeles market"
good,"be ready to work Mandatory Overtime, all holidays, all days, over 10-24 hours during irregular operations. Opportunity for growth is encouraged. Training in Dallas for 2 weeks provided."
good,"Southwest is one of the best fun environments I've experienced.  People are very friendly.  "
good,Career advancement is based on who you know and not what you know. Lack of diversity on the executive level. Not much room for advancement for minorities.
good,"Southwest is a fun and great place to work. There are many perks to working here. If you are flexible and enjoy making a lot of money, this is the place for you!"
good,I've been with Southwest more than 20 years and it has changed from a family company to a more corporate company. The culture is very different too. Just coming into this company as a new hire its a very good company to work for and the benefits are better than most companies.
good,Positive work environment. Compassionate managers who are willing to be helpful at any moment.  They promote family and work life balance and the perks are endless.
good,Customers come first as it should be. With you job duties you should show legendary service as always. Worked for Southwest for 27 years and it brought me great things in life like raising 5 kids and moving them on threw life while working here.
good,"Southwest is a great place to work. The company prides itself on promoting from within. If you get in early in your career and want to have a place that you can work at for 25-30 years and retire, this is the place for you. "
good,"I love the company, but the call center is not a position for me, I am a people pleaser and being on calls is not for me. I like to work directly with people."
good,Loved the company but my next steps were to move away from Massachusetts. The work life balance left a lot to be desired too. I LOVED the culture and the mission.
good,"Handled incident support tickets daily.  Code fixes after recreating bug on test system."
good,They seem to do things the hard way. Good perks and 401K but you have to work for them a long time to be in the good pay bracket. Poor supervisors and average managers.
good,Age old technology makes employee life difficult to work and support needs of SWA.  Reservation and revenue system is very completed and need to upgrade to future technology
good,Great company and awesome culture. Lots of learning and amazing group of people. Would recommend to work here. The management is very relaxed and realistic.
good,"Hard balance when you are married and have small children.  Culture could have changed, but when I was working my way up the chain, I had to move like every 1-2 years and open new cities.  They aren't very sympathetic to ""I need to talk it over with my family"".  They are your family....."
good,Worked for the company ten years ago and it was the best place to work all around loved it. Had a family emergency out of state so i had to move and leave the job. Returned to new management and the company has went downhill and is catching momentum. Work moral all over the states is down and people are leaving like crazy. Sad to say such a good place went down hill under the new leadership.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Great opportunity for advancement.  Lots of change.  Never a dull day.  Annual and economic raises
good,Can make as many hours as wanted and flexible scheduling. great 401k can be a career. need a little work on management and communication but ramp agents stick together.
good,Company used to be about Employees and Customers first.  Now it seems to be more about making money and policy/procedure and less about looking out for their greatest asset...their people.
good,"I love this company and am sad to have had so many roadblocks for advancement.  The people are wonderful, the culture is amazing, the compensation is okay but you can 'fly for free' which has also been a lot harder the last couple of years.  "
good,Hardest part of the job are the hours if you are working in or around the airport whether flying or ground crew.  Many locations are 24/7 with varying shifts and days off.  May take you years to work you're way up the seniority list with weekends off.  Most desk jobs that are 9-5 are located in Dallas HDQ.
good,"A nice place to work."
good,Loading and off loading commercial passenger aircraft. Marshaling in the aircraft and pushing them out to taxi to the runway.  In general servising the aircraft.
good,"•	Assist customers with travel arrangements, purchases, lost/delayed baggage and other gate services"
good,"Fully Trained on all Ground operations procedures. Worked outdoors in the elements year round. Completed multiple tasks under extreme time constraints. Helped train employees on proper, safe working techniques. Trialed new ways to work safely and efficiently. Management as a whole is great. They show respect and want to hear your opinion, but they do not act when they learn what your concern is. The co-workers are one of the best and worst part of the job along with the weather and supervisors. They are either extremely hard working or unbelieveably lazy."
good,"its a great place to work the people are great my schedule is very flexible, I get free time off, one day a month, I also can time trade with others which is very helpful."
good,"Good work/life balance and excellent benefits - health insurance, 401k, profit sharing, free standby flights."
good,"They offer great benefits including free travel. Much of the ""fun-loving"" culture is absent under the current management - at least in the bigger facilities. It's seniority based, and unionized work. This means there can be lot of mandatory/voluntary overtime. Great earning potential, though. Some have made up to 6 figures their first year of hire. This is most common in the larger facilities."
good,A very fun place to work as there is less work pressure in comparison to other companies. People are very nice and helpful.  Team player is the key in this company.
good,"Plenty of opportunity for growth, the airport positions are seniority based, be prepared to work evenings and weekends. There can be tons of downtime or no days with no downtime at all."
good,Ok job flying benefits are good different things you can do while working there upbeat atmosphere. Friendly company. New management so things are a little different now
good,"It was a good experience.  I would recommend it as great starting point. Depending on where you start in can be a rewarding experience.  The Airline industry is not for everyone.  You will have challenges with Airplanes, weather and of course people."
good,constant opportunity to help others with a constantly changing environment* opportunities to make a difference in peoples lives* too many lazy coworkers
good,"SOUTHWEST AIRLINES is a phenomenal first CUSTOMER SERVICE position if you want to get a taste of the business. Working in SFO is ideal, as it is a much smaller station that handles a HUGENESS amount of DRAMA. SFO is notorious for DELAYS & CANCELLED flights, so being that it is a smaller station you have a lot more HELP dealing with issues. If you manage to get IN sat SFO, take advantage of the help and smaller station because there are always problems at SFO, daily, and MOST of the employees all work together to help get through the LONG DAYS/NIGHTS that are ahead."
good,"Over 6 years with the company and the only complaint I have is the transitioning of positions and union contracts that does not have much job security for probationary employees. Other than that, great company with an amazing culture."
good,"For the most part the company is amazing. The travel benefits are great and compensation is good. However, if you do not have an airline background it hard to start as a leader."
good,"Southwest Airlines has a tendency to work hard and play harder.  Although the demands are great, they make sure to incorporate an excellent employee incentive program"
good,Its a great company. Your co-workers work as a team. I would recommend working there. If you like to travel and great benefits and your a hard worker you'll like working there.
good,"Southwest just like most companies  is whatever you make out of it. Being a ramp agent has its ups and downs. The ups include a good amount of free time on some days. The downs can include non stop work in difficult weather, rough work on your body and starting off the pay is not ideal...but it gets better."
good,"I would love to say that SWA has been everything it was cracked up to be.  The benefits are amazing, if you have children or are prone to being sick.  But, if you are young, single and looking for work-life balance, you might be better off looking somewhere else. "
good,"Southwest is a awesome company but PHL station management sucks, the supervisors never communicate with one another, and a few supervisors you ask a question on something you’re not sure about they shrug their shoulders and don’t anything. Few supervisors care, some don’t at all, just there to collect a check."
good,"Good place to work.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Great culture to work in."
good,"I did three internships at technical operations and was expecting a full time offer, but I was not considered for one. I thought after three internships I would be a good candidate for a full time position. In my opinion it was because at the time I needed sponsorship to work. I dont anymore, but I still dont get offers from southwest. Anyway.. good company to work for for sure. Just be careful about politics in the team."
good,"Typical workday consisted of daily meetings with Agile team members for the roll-out of Mobile devices.  Learned certificate pushed to Apple devices.  Management is fairly young but also very friendly.  The workplace culture is a fun and energetic, very social organization.  The hardest part of the position was learning the layout of the main buildings.  Fun group, great work/life balance."
good,The pay was low but it made up for it in the environment and the free travel. I missed spending time with my family. When they were home I was working. Our schedules didn't mesh.
good,"A great place to work! It has its slew of perks but also a couple huge downsides. Health, Dental, Vision, and flight benefits are awesome! But the downside includes the stingy rules regarding sick days and absences. Friendly environment and fun atmosphere."
good,"I loved working for this company.  Great benefits, great people to work with.  A long term, viable, profitable company.  Nice trip benefits as well.  Availability of overtime was great."
good,"Absolutely loved my job. Loved what I did and could not have asked for a better company to work for. The benefits are amazing for a reason because the work schedule is far from amazing. Don't get me wrong it is seniority based and if you put in your time you are rewarded. The union represents the employees well and you definitely reap the benefit. You will not find a better workplace culture. "
good,"I just wanted to move on to another phase of my life, over 50, that didn't involve as much physical labor.  SWA is a great company.  The challenge is the working environment where ""seniority is a precious commodity.""  Your first 5 years with any airline are far from glamorous."
good,"Great way to to broaden your horizons, with a great company culture that is struggling to maintain it's identity. Unfortunately the new CEO and top executives and BOD have given in to greed to increase the bottom line, sacrificing safety and sometimes ignoring federal aviation standards to do so."
good,SWA was a good place to work at. They were very flexible with your schedule. There were two shifts and the atmosphere was pretty laid back most of the time.
good,"this company had a great culture and treated its employees like a valued asset. work place was very diverse, from the employees to the weather to the flight schedules."
good,"Learned to adapt to people and  situations.  Learned  patients, how to come passengers down, work in stressful  emergency medical, weather and maintenance problems. Job is amazing way of life. Loved teaching and hiring people into the industry."
good,"It was a good job I messed it up so that is on me.  Other than that they provide everything you need and it is a union job so you get paid pretty well especially after your there a while, like 11 years lol"
good,"Southwest has a wonderful work ethic, Their business practices are top notch. The company is all about making sure their internal customers are as happy as the external."
good,"A good place to learn the ins and outs of being a ramp Agent, the other ramp agents were awesome to work with. Especially with the long hours and mandatory overtime they became like a 2nd family.  I didn't really care for management as they played a lot of favoritism.  The owner of the company is a remarkable man that has this gift that once he meets you he will never ever forget what your name is."
good,"Culture has declined. Still a good job, but, just another big airline. good job good job good job goood job gooooooood job   goood job goooooood job good job!"
good,Southwest was a great place to work. The employees were all great and so were some of the leaders.  The culture of the workplace was dynamic and I learned something new everyday talking with different people from all over the country.
good,Overall good company. Shifts worked depends on seniority.  So less seniority gets you less likely shift and days off. But lots of flexibility because agents can work for each other.
good,"It's very laid back, no dress code - jeans and tennis shoes everyday. There are weekly cultural events, plenty of deck parties and food galore! They take pride in their employees and customers."
good,I have always been really interested in aviation and it was exciting to get to work at an airport. I got to work with a lot of interesting people and even travel.
good,The flight benefits were the most enjoyable parts of this job and the most challenging was the mandatory overtime when circumstances arose.  Some customers were pleasant while others required more attention.
good,So much to learn from my Colleagues. The Work place is so disciplianed and working culture is absolutely professional.
good,You will work hard but the benefits make it well work it. An amazing company with a great culture but local management can be hard to work for at most times.
good,"Southwest Airlines is the ultimate place to work.  We worked hard and occasionally we'd play hard!!!  Yes, this is a fun-loving, servants heart and warrior spirit place to work.  This suited me very well.  If you are fortunate enough to work at head-quarters in Dallas, there is a gourmet chef on 5th floor waiting to make your lunch just the way you need it.  Many great perks.  ♥♥♥♥"
good,Great company and all about the employees.I learned more about human remain transport.My co-workers were awesome they worked and showed me everything I need to know.
good,southwest airlines is a ok company if u like to travel a lot. the pay is not great but the workers are cool. you will do hard labor in all weather conditions.
good,"If you like working in all types of weather this is great for you. working in rain, snow, and extreme heat 8-16 hours a day sometime more. Great overtime pay, x1.5, x2, and x3 pay on holidays. Fast pace work loading and unloading aircraft."
good,"Southwest Airlines is an incredible company. It is difficult at first with the 6 month probation, but overall a great experience and fun culture. It's pretty routine, management isn't that great but the station is good. The craziest (in a good way) group of people I've ever worked with. Mandatory overtime can throw a wrench in your plans, but it's double time."
good,Culture is very laid back and positive people to be around. People are usually supportive. Sometimes would wish managers were more aggressive. It's acceptable to walk around and chat it up with those around you. Most enjoyable part of my job was being around positive people.
good,"The work with Southwest Airlines vary from day to day it depends on the assignment given to me on that day, it can be from gate relief, checking in passengers at the gate, assisting customers with their quiries and concerns, helping other team members with their concers or areas."
good,This was an excellent company to work for. Its just really hard when you have small children. I loved the free flight privileges and the people I worked with.
good,"I loved working for Southwest Airlines, although if you are a parent to young children, then this job really isnt for you. Its more of a job for those living the single life."
good,"- I coordinated with the ATC tower, costumer service, ramp, TSA, And all internal departments, to maintain a efficient flowing operation."
good,"There are always new challenges that arise in your work with Southwest Airlines.  The company encourages working hard and playing hard.  Unfortunately, without changing area of expertise, there are very little opportunities for career growth.  Overall, Southwest is a good company with great intentions."
good,"Company overall is excellent -  I was in a contract position and was treated very well with all employees and management alike."
good,This was a productive and fun place to work at a very fast pace. The team was small and worked well together. The projects were very detail orientated and highly visible.
good,"Excellent organization to work for if you are willing to settle for complacency and be apart of a political work environment that sometimes prevents advancement. Educational achievement is celebrated; however, occupational worth is minimal. ""We're proud of your personal accomplishments, but we don't believe in you enough to promote your success."""
good,Work life balance isn't easy... seniority based company so you have to work from the bottom up.. the flexibility is great and it's union work. You get to fly for free
good,"Great place to work with a great culture, management can be a little stiff and may micro-manage at times. All in all would highly recommend as a great career."
good,Most days are fabulous days at Southwest Airlines.  The only thing that I despite is that you have to brown nose to get promoted. I wish that promotions were given based upon merit.
good,Extremely fast paced.  No room for mistakes.  You are expected to be punctual and work hard to reap the rewards. If you can't keep pace or take time off for a medical procedure they will find a way to show you the door.
good,"I worked in Grand Prairie at the Reservation Center.  I regret quiting now, due to divorce. It was a busy, but relaxing atmosphere. I enjoyed helping customers with their needs. The managers were very nice.  I received a perfect review my first year, which was very satisfying. I liked working for "
good,There were still a lot of upper management changes to come.  When they walked my hiring manager out after me working there 5 - 6 weeks I began to worry about my 12 month contract.  They assured me I wasn't affected.  After about 4 months there they decided they no longer needed my services.  I was so sad.
good,"Every day is different and I tend to go with the flow.  "
good,Working in Customer Relations can be a very stressful job if you allow the Customers complaints to get in your head. I've learned great time management skills and patience with this job. Southwest as a company has amazing culture and no shortage of fun events you can attend. The best thing about this job/company is the people you work with. You must have patience with any position you start in since it's very competitive to move to a different position/department.
good,"Work culture is fun but hours can be long. Health benefits are phenomenal. If you are a people person, then this is the job for you. Getting to use your problem solving skills every day really gives you a sense of accomplishment."
good,"If you’re single and live at home, this is a great place to fly for. The TWU seriously needs to rewrite the way we get paid because we are not fairly compensated. You’re not getting paid unless that door is closed so if they decide to load the plane with passengers during a snow storm knowing that we won’t be released, you now have to deal with angry passengers for almost three hours all while not getting paid. Sadly the old days of Southwest are gone."
good,Being s customer service agent will definitely put your people skills to work. Encountering a multitude of situations and personalities at once all will getting the job done something you encounter daily. You must be prepared to make decisions and assist customers at all points of contact.
good,The great job culture comes at a cost of a lower salary based on the market.  The challenge is that the experience level is not as experienced as you would find outside the organization.  They believe that since they are such a popular company to the public that anyone would do business with them and do not understand when companies do not subscribe to that way of thinking.
good,"My time at southwest was pleasant. The company prides themselves in having a fun loving atmosphere and it has a strong culture. The benefits southwest provides are wonderful. The hours can be difficult as well as the mandatory overtime. The job is very fast paced and can be stressful, especially when irregular operations happen. The most enjoyable part of working for Southwest was my coworkers. Southwest makes you feel like you are part of a family and the flight benefits are nice as well."
good,As an employee you get great benefits package. Your initial pay I feel is a bit low and should be more competitive. But as a more senior agent you will top out at 30$ an hour.  Shifts are bid shifts based on seniority and working weekends is possible and holidays. San Antonio Center is open from 7am-4am so you could have a shift that is nights. Training is partially in Dallas so you must be able to travel for 2 weeks. It’s a demanding position but if you love to travel flight benefits are worth it all.
good,Five days a week is too many days for part time employees! Too much mandatory overtime! Great benefits if you need them & if you work for this company a long time the profit sharing really adds up also 401 Kaplan is great
good,"swa is a great company to work for. they have great benefits and lots of room for advancement. flying benefits is awesome when there is space available. but its impossible to nonrev to cities that have a special events going on. for example mardi gras in new orleans will be a headache to nonrev to. there is no discounts on tickets but the flights are free for employee, spouse, and children under 24. for international flights taxes must be paid. starting pay is very low which sucks because traveling becomes very limited. you can fly there free but still need money to pay for an enjoyable experience. to take a comfortable trip will take about 5 years of raises. unless you work doubles every day. speaking of doubles I love the flexibility. you can make as much money as you want by signing the overtime book, or picking up shifts. or you can work as little as you want by giving away your shift. I will definitely recommend working at southwest as a second job. until you start making enough money for a comfortable living"
good,Really amazing office place to work. You're surrounded by really smart co-workers who are very passionate about what they do. I also loved the casual dress code of the company.
good,"Typical workday consisted of daily meetings with Agile team members for the roll-out of Mobile devices. Learned certificate pushed to Apple devices. Management is fairly young but also very friendly. The workplace culture is a fun and energetic, very social organization. The hardest part of the position was learning the layout of the main buildings. Fun group, great work/life balance. Very diversified groups."
good,"Lots of interaction between the teams, team lunches. barbecues.  Great place to work!  Beautiful office setting, colorful.  Culture there is relaxing and like a family!"
good,"A Typical day at work is dispatching flights and uploading and unloading aircrafts. Maintaining  the operation,help others develop self reliance and Trained New Hirers"
good,"Work your shift and get out of there.   Most Management does not appreciated you.  They are all about numbers and on time performance . "
good,Amazing work place if you're an employee. Contractors have to pay for everything and get no benefits. The requirements you get are very well laid out and you get to speciliaze in one product.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a great place to work, health benefits and salaries could be a lot better. There's room for advancement but its a slow process. They also Micro manage your time.  They have lots of activities to participate in and that's great. The hardest part of the job is the Mandatory  overtime, If you don't do it when required you could lose your job"
good,"I love the job because i can work as many as 60 to 80 hours a week. "
good,Employees are more of a family. We learn to have fun and still get our work done properly. Benefits are wonderful and free flights are always amazing!
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced usually back to back calls.  I learned how to multitask with each call depending on callers needs.  We had a great culture were employees helped one anther and there was always something being celebrated weather it was a holiday, special event or fund raiser.  The hardest part of the job was went we could not accommodate a customer for there needs due to lack of seating on aircraft.  The most enjoyable was being able to help a customer in a time of need getting them rerouted or getting them on an earlier flight to get home due to an emergency."
good,Lots of standing but mainly not a bad company at all. Offers lots of time off and income is unlimited to what you are interested in making. Would recommend this company to anyone
good,Very pleasant people but remote work is not an option; they value face to face communications. Far too many contractors in IT for the number of employees.
good,Airline industry is very competitive with the major airlines.  Southwest is in the market of adding additional flights to destinations in Mexico and other fun destinations.
good,if the hours for the part time employees wasn't only four also if the work schedule was more open other than that its a great company free flights even though the planes could be a little bit bigger
good,"Southwest signed an IT outsourcing agreement which drove considerable drama.  The people across their Business Units and IT departments were good to work with on a day to day, projects basis."
good,"Great place to work but way too much Kool-Aid. If the focus for hiring or promoting Leaders was more focused on experience vs. soft skills, it would get five starts in all rating categories."
good,"As long as your not management, this is the place to work. The union is strong and will protect you from any type of discipline or criticism. If you become management, watch your back, the people who were your friends are no long your friends and will stab you in the back for trying to better yourself. Upper management will actually condone such actions."
good,"Southwest Airlines is a company who takes pride in their employees.  While there are departments to steer clear of if you're looking for the known southwest ""spirit"",  in general a Southwest team member is an amazing career to have."
good,"Great place to work, Very physically demanding job with up most attention to detail to customer as well as fellow employees safety."
good,"I really enjoyed working at SWACU. it has it's issues like everywhere else but the benefits and perks outweigh most of the bad. Accountability among management and advancement opportunities were the only reasons I even left. If the managers had held their employees accountable or been held responsible for their employees I probably would still be there. Dress code and hours can't be beat. Overall atmosphere is wonderful, just those few bad apples that ruin the bunch."
good,Great flexibility in hours. Entrusted to work independently on assignments with limited supervision. Fun work environment. Gained experience in a typical office setting.
good,"This is absolutely a great company; the benefits and perks are wonderful. The company provide stability and growth but you have to be open and willing take and explore opportunities. The department can be very strict and less forgiving but overall, while I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Co workers are good people, I learned how to be able to work on a solid schedule one that doesn't shift. the work schedule is flexible, you can create your own work schedule but you have to jump thru hoops."
good,"The knowledge and experienced that i gained from working in the call center answering calls from customers concerning ticket, flight information, refunds, and adjustments for scheduled flights was a great experience.."
good,"Southwest is one of the best companies I have worked for. "
good,Excellent company culture. Love the job and everyone is support here.I worked here as an intern and loved my internship.
good,"Handling passengers on a daily basis face to face and focusing on their needs to make sure they are happy with their whole experience."
good,"This company is one of the best jobs I've ever had. I didn't like that the schedules were based off seniority is my only real issue with the company. Besides having 2 consecutive days off, the company also gives you an extra day on them (paid) for you to have off each month. Flight benefits were great always, very nice and friendly family oriented environment."
good,"The best part of the job for me was the people I worked with.  We were all a big family for the most part.  Fun place to work, however, it had its downsides like every job. Management could have been improved on in my opinion."
good,"every day is a challenge day, move airplanes to gate as fast as I can with safe condition. Full all compliane prior to aircraft return to service. Very motivated people to work with, superb company and nice and great environment. Learn fuselage skin repair, flight control rigging trouble shooting, engine rigging and trouble shooting, pretty advance knowledge in all ATA codes, handle all daily issues related to aircraft. Very cooperative coworkers to work with and work as a team player. the hardest part of my job is to move the plane with minimum interval of time with full compliance. The most enjoyable part of my job is a fun loving environmet with party every week to see each others regarding company standing and forthcoming events."
good,"Working required overtime to get good pay.  Flying free is good benefit, it takes money."
good,The job required you to load/unload and provision medium sized jet aircraft in a short period of time facilitating on-time departures.  Southwest was a very enjoyable company to work for as they paid a very good wage in an industry that has been under fire.  Working inside the aircaft bins could be difficult at times as you had to work from a kneeling position lifting sometimes very heavy pieces of luggage and cargo.
good,"Build reservations and sell flights for passengers."
good,"Dealt with all questions that customers, both internal and external might have. Learned that a satisfied employee can always handle a dissatisfied customer."
good,"Its the best job i have been, you never know what are you going to encounter on a daily basis, because the atmosphere can change from organized to crazy."
good,LGA provides constant challenges to an airline's airport operation. There are many opportunities to learn how to efficiently run a business operation in a fast paced and constantly evolving work environment.
good,Very stressful job but great benefits and opportunity for advancement.
good,Great airline to work for with great benefits.The sad thing is the airline is becoming so big that it's loosing it's culture and the reason it was such a popular airline.
good,"Working for this company, I have learned the value of good working relationships. My co-workers were very easy to get along with. This is a great environment to work in."
good,Focusing on diverse responsibilities where deadlines are a priority and handling multiple jobs simultaneously is a requirement.
good,"Would absolutely work there again. Great culture, lots of great Employees and TERRIFIC benefits."
good,"Good place to work. Nothing can beat the perks. Pay is not very good, but the work culture is amazing. Extensive use of Excel, Tableau, Alteryx and SQL."
good,"Great place to be a full time employee.  The culture is unique and respectful of everyone which is the strength of the company."
good,Being a flight attendant you get to experience many different obstacles. Fun and professional. Traveling and meeting different people are a great place.
good,Great company with happy employees and good benefits. everyone is very friendly and the learning is endless but it is very competitive and very difficult to move up.
good,"You will work hard, but overall the teamwork is amazing. As long as you are not a lazy person who works hard at trying to get out of work, your coworkers are willing to help you. The worst part of the job is dealing with weather variations and the physical labor. The best part of the job was the flight benefits and pay and the feeling of belonging to a team."
good,"Working with a team that was focused on getting the job done made it easier and a pleasure even on stressful days.  At times, there was good camaderie.  A sense of self-fulfillment and accomplishment is achievable."
good,Fun and cultural. Family atmosphere. Customer focused. Busy and dedicated to Customer Service and Safety. Purposeful and driven. People first. Reliability is a requirement.
good,"Great experience overall, sometimes tasks felt overly repetitive and a bit mundane. Occasional drama between co-workers, could stand to be reduced with a variety of interventions."
good,Overall a Great company to work for. Pay is great as well as the benefits. You flight benefits along with great healthcare. You have the option to move up or change positions within the company.
good,A great pace to work. Flying benefits are great. Management backs you up in your decision  . They have a culture committee and participate in allot of benefit and charity events.
good,"Provided friendly telephone communication with external customers maintaining positive rapport by"
good,"Great company to work, just the managers need to think in the contractors as persons and not as money or gross margin, As a contractor you depend on what the company need from the contractor company and don't think in you as a person with needs."
good,Enjoyed interacting with coworkers in my department and other departments.  Worked long hours and had to adapt to changing weather conditions.  Able to travel statewide.
good,Great Company with overall great benefits. They provide an amazing 401K and profit sharing program. They have generous PTO benefits. The health benefits rate among the best. Excellent CEO and President of the company.
good,"maintaining safe/clean workplace "
good,"I really liked the people I worked with and the public that we served.  We bid for hours every month but could pick up shifts or could be asked to work mandatory overtime.  Everyday was different depending on the weather, day of the week, time of day or what time of year.  There were no problems just solutions.  Southwest Airlines was fun to work for even if passengers were upset about delayed flights, delayed baggage and canceled flights.  We did the best we were able to considering how unpredictable life will be.  I would still be working for them if I hadn't hurt my shoulder while putting a heavy bag on the belt."
good,"Enjoyed working here, for the most part, love the flight benefits. The company can do a better job with giving young leaders a bench to grow and follow thru on their progress."
good,"Good company. I'm currently in a Temp position, so I do not receive any of the benefits that the company offers. Overall, Southwest is a great place to work."
good,"Stressful at times - working with the traveling public - and all the emotion that can entail for many -  I used my HUMOR, Compassion, and great training - to ensure everyone had a safe and memorable journey."
good,Some downtime. Sometimes forced overtime. Union work so sometimes people don't always pull their weight. Pretty hard to be fired unless you steal or just don't show up.
good,"I enjoyed working for SWA. Were if not for damaging my wrist, I'd be there today. The pay is low to start with. You can barter to get more hours, but no overtime for those extra hours. There are times where you can volunteer for OT or they sometimes have mandatory OT - that's when you make bank. If I was short of cash, I'd take a portion of someone's shift...that's how you make a living. I worked when I wanted - as long as I worked my schedule first. If you had to take time off - i had food poisoning one time - you do seem to have ""consequences"" for not being a work. I could not get anyone to take my shift because there is not access to email to notify anyone that would take your shift."
good,"The Airline industry has its highs and lows, depends on the time of the year."
good,Southwest has turned from a company that thrived on its culture and excellent internal and external customer service to a numbers crunching bank machine.
good,Great company!! If you are willing to move around the country and work at the airport then you are in for the career of your life. My goal is to secure a job at Headquarters but those positions are hard to come by because no one ever leaves.
good,"Clock I for work on time, checked the schedule to see where you're going to be placed at today."
good,"It was great to work for SW. I had the job out of college. The newbies usually get the worst of shifts but if you are lucky enough you can trade. If you out in good effort on the job, you will be ultimately rewarded."
good,"The daily workload is manageable and fun to work on. Interact daily with creative agency and is a very fast paced environment. Also, management is so great, but compensation is lacking."
good,i enjoyed the culture and environment at Southwest Airlines. I loved the fact that i had a variety in duties that kept me moving. I loved the work culture.
good,"Low pay in the beginning, rewarded for effort, flight benefits are awesome. Union regulated so some employees take advantage of union benefits to work less/not as hard."
good,Very fast paced work environment.  Lots to learn at first.  Very fun work environment.  Easy to do if you don't mind working outside.  Leadership in St. Louis is questionable at times and hours are long.  Lots of overtime.  Pay scale is nice.  Union protection.
good,great place to work. good management. Learned a lot. A very busy day on a daily basis. should be prepare at all times for changes. keep yourself updated at all times
good,"Overall solid company to work for. Union environment in warehouse and maintenance departments which can at times create challenges. However the benefit packages, compensation, and longevity are strong positives for working for this company."
good,SWA is a good place to work.  It has a nice group of people who are encouraged to work together as a team to meet or exceed company goals. All of the group members are nice to work with.
good,"As a flight attendant you have flexibility that is unmatched by most jobs, and depending on your perspective the time spend away from home can be rejuvenating or tortuous.  You'll meet amazing people and visit amazing places.  The free flights are the best!!!"
good,"Very flexible work shifts, great benefits, and excellent pay. Great thing about the Airline business is the downtime. We work hard and fast paced when we are working, but because we work in gates by flights, we have an even amount of downtime."
good,"Enjoy my job and working with people, but no longer want to commute and travel it requires. It is a great company with great benefits. I am just looking for a different lifestyle at this time in my life."
good,Job with great benefits but the environment has to many complacent people. People are cool but sometimes the environment can be really had on the Ramp Agents and getting paid too little for a long period of time.
good,Southwest is a good company; however some of the leaders in different department is not living the SWALIFE way. They make up their own rules and are not trustworthy.
good,"I retired from Southwest,when i started with them you could not ask for a better company to work for,they were very family oriented.As they have gotten bigger i think they have forgotten what the company founder said or,that the people are makes better than everyone else at doing what we do.Fly people point to point safely.I miss the old company and hope they find there way home.Instead of becoming like everyone else."
good,"It's all about the culture. Great place to work, you can't speak any higher about a company then this they are the best I've ever seen or been apart of. The only thing I'd like to see is a little higher pay and career advancement path."
good,"Great company, executive leaders are and are humble. You will work hard but you'll play hard too. Work side by side with some of the kindest ppl you'll ever meet and fly for free. Hard to get promoted bc most ppl don't leave their good positions,can run into the good ol boy system."
good,"Free flights are always nice when you can get time off to take them."
good,"all of the employees are very respectful, nice, and helpful. its a great place to work if you're looking for a fun and friendly environment. training is done well."
good,Efficient and challenging. Great place to groom yourself to be a successful professional. Very good training techniques.
good,Load planes take bags off work as a team talk with customers use computer heavy lifting                                                                                   work close with management
good,previous employment with SWA had to leave due to financial problems . worked over 7 years on ramp miss the people and the location but needed to move back up North
good,working in southwest client is good experience. SME's are good and the good company to work. I like the fun activity they used to conduct in Monday's insetad of Firday's
good,"A great company to work for, with lots of great benefits and room for advancement and travel. The hardest part of being a ramp agent is working in extreme weather and temperatures"
good,Great company to join. Training program is very tight on the terminal with all eyes on deck. Get ready to work in all kinds of weather. Benefits are wonderful.
good,"I really cannot help but say special thanks to two very special people"
good,"its good to work with southwest airlines,i learned so much in this company,the management of this company also supporting me very well,and my co workers also gave me full support to work,their is no hardest part in this company,we are all enjoying very well and i have done my work also very well.thank you for southwest airlines to gave me such a wonderful opportunity."
good,Great job to meet new people everyday. Great job to travel all over the world. Great place to be able to make customers feel safe and have a good time.
good,Happy to go to work.  Learned that a happy and positive (can-do) employee makes for a great company in regards to customers and investors.
good,Fun place to work and phenomenal benefits. Great team work among the crews. Although more recently management has taken a turn to follow the path of other airlines. The individuality of Southwest is no longer that which it once was.
good,"Good balance of work and personal living. Top quality professionals seeking to learn and get better as a group and company. Very customer service oriented mind not only for the external customers but for co-workers, which are called customers also."
good,"The flight benefits are great,but the pay is not very good. You bid for schedules, so seniority is very important. You can switch days off easily and take days off without pay if the call center is slow."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Southwest Airlines. It was a very fun and challenging work environment. Interior Design and Project Management are the areas of concentration I'm currently looking for.
good,"Great Company to work for.  They really do have a loving family environment.  I work in the Flight Operations Department( Crew Scheduling).  There is a lot of turn over within Crew Scheduling departments and within the operations departments as well.  Very behind the times in technology and business processes. A lot of the management have been here for years so it makes it very hard to bring new concepts and ideas to the table (afraid of change). But most departments allow internal transfers"

good,began my career here out of college and hands down have not found another company to work for as great as this one
good,A typical day at Southwest Airlines begins early 4;30AM.  Aircrafts at the gates need to be opened up and ensure they are at the correct jetway.  Paperwork is printed including weather notams and forcasts.  The passengers are the most enjoyable part of this job.  Their excitment of traveling for a job or a vacation is infectous.
good,"Met new personalities daily"
good,"Management and training are very challenging fields but can be rewarding.  Been apart of both help me to manage time better to be more efficient.  Learning to balance my time better help me to improve on my on time performance and deadlines by more than 50 %.  To be able to pass on what I have learned and new ideas to my Co-workers to help them to improve.

good,Great balance of work and play. The culture is extraordinary.
good,"takes care of there employees, has a lot of growth opportunities"
good,Southwest is a fun but also very stressful environment.  Every day is different.  My co-workers are great and willing to help you out at anytime.  Hardest part of the job was learning to accept that you will be verbally abused by passengers and not to take it personal.  The best part is knowing you brightened a lot of passengers day by getting them from point a to b
good,"In my six years at Southwest, I was able to grow professionally as I advanced in both compensation and responsibility. The people I worked with were inspired about their jobs, and I felt a sense of pride being part of a company so motivated by customer service and safety."
good,Southwest has great culture and diverse view in the workplace. Very open and laid back but also dedicated to deliver excellent customer service.
good,"Southwest Airlines, is an amazing company to work for. If you like to have fun, be around people and help them in time of need this is the job for you.  I loved working for this company because I was able to be myself.. had fun with co-workers and interact with passangers. The hardest part was delays due to weather or things beyond one's control.  I loved being loaned out to other cities when they were short staffed and the fact that basically you were able to make as much or as little money as you want."
good,"Southwest Airlines in my opinion provides friendly and loving work environment that has allowed me to improve my communication, sales and people skills. Southwest Airlines provides amazing health and other benefits, advancement opportunities to any department in parts of the country an office in located. SWA provides flexibility and management is always available."
good,we would add up the amount of liquor that was sold on the planes and input it into the system.
good,I enjoyed my time of employment with Southwest Airline. I am now seeking employment and would love to be hired by Southwest.
good,"Southwest was a great Employer, fast, fun and, friendly enviroment. Provided lots of opportunities to grow as an employee and a person."
good,"Awesome benefits and culture, however within the company they treat the flight attendants very different than they treat the rest of their employees."
good,There is a transition happening at SWA that is justified as it grows internationally that causes those core values to be challenged. Hopefully they will remain intact as those are the foundation with which SWA was built.
good,If you want to see the world then what’s holding you back? Benefits are awesome!! Make your dreams a reality. Go see the what the world has to offer. Don’t hold back!!
good,"You will be tied to a phone all day and you must enjoy that. There is no flexibility in that. There is a lot of flexibility with your work schedule. You can switch back and forth from full time to part time, you are able to give away and pick up shifts."
good,"Fun environment to work in. I learned a great deal about the travel industry and customer service. The workplace culture there in CS&S is relatively fast paced. It definitely improved my typing skills and public speaking skills. I find myself much more articulate than I was before. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to assist and make customers happy. It brings a smile to my face to know that I have helped a customer connect with a loved one, or get them excited for a vacation. The hardest part of my job is hearing an angry or sad customer's voice on the phone where a flight was delayed or canceled, causing them to miss a flight or an event. It's no fun having to disappoint the customer due to something that is out of our control and certainly nothing of their doing. As far as management and leadership is concerned, I think that the Team leaders at the call center I worked at, need to get on one page. They all look for different things and differently hold their team members to different standards. when in fact, we should all be learning and doing the same thing in that call center. the team leaders are not all on one accord. Most of the leaders there are great, but one or two of them I am not so  sure carryout the mission of southwest. Overall its an absolute wonderful company to work for."
good,"Great place to work with lots of ways to work as many hours or less hours as you want"
good,Great company to work for! Best Co-workers ever. The starting pay is not the best but with longevity the pay and benefits are great. As a newish employee the work life balance when you have a family is tough. Must be able to work anytime. As you acquire seniority your shifts and hours improve.
good,"SWA is awesome - unfortunately one subpar leader ruined my six year experience. The culture is second to none, and while many of the jobs may not be glorious, SWA hires only top level people, and that's what sets the company apart."
good,"Southwest was a great company to work for. It's culture is unique from the rest of the companies. The call center's typical day at work included helping customers book flights, questions about policy and just pretty much everything preparing for them to fly or sometimes complaints post-flight. The hardest part about the job is sometimes you get personal with the passenger because their flight was cancelled due to mechanical or weather or whatever the reason was, and you could't "
good,good company to work for flying benifits are great but it can be demanding if staffing is short.  being mandotoried to work every day can be a hassle and inconvience but thats what you sign up for
good,I would recommend this company to anyone the culture is awesome and the people are so friendly. I just wish the pay was more but if your patient enough and promote to a hire position it would be such an great career.
good,Work/life balance is hard to achieve when you first work for the company because you are on the bottom of the totem pole. Management seems invested in their employees.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a very good company. The culture is very strong. The company invest a lot of time and money on training its employees. It offers a high 401K match, profit sharing and stock option purchase plan."
good,The culture at SWA is very much what I expected. There is always something that cultivates networking and culture. The typical work day consists of 2-3 meetings. Regular 1 on 1 sessions with management. Quarterly meetings meeting to review overall health of company and internal teams.
good,"On a typical day, you will load about 100 bags on a flight plus freight. You will have usually 4 flight a shift. There are times that the weather can affect your flights and you will have to make sure that you have the right bags for the flight that is at your gate."
good,"Work life balance wasn't the greatest Everything else is great. Good benefits, family oriented, customer service is A1. I have smaller children so I need certain hours."
good,"Meant many different people, everyone super nice and supportive. It sometimes made the time fly bye, remember you were on the  phone from the time you clocked In into the time you clocked out."
good,"A typical day at work involves coming in and finding which position you've been assigned for that day. This could be working the flights at a gate or coordinating the operations."
good,I had an opportunity within 6 months to move up into management at Southwest Airlines.  they appreciated my talents and utilized me to my fullest.  I learned a lot.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  Only thing I did not like was that the payroll department worked every weekend and had days off during the week.  doesn't work if you have children, in my opinion."
good,"It was a great learning environment. I learned to speak different languages to help customers the best way I can. There was great times that we had at work, and it was an overall entertaining experience."
good,"This is a job that pays well and have great benefits that requires no real educational background . I would recommend to anyone, but it’s a very physical job."
good,Working for this company would be one of the most successful things I ever went through in my life working here would probably make my life a little easier and better being a single woman again and traveling the world be something that I would love to do so hopefully you will see my review and you be interested in hiring me as an employee at your company thanks and bye
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the fun environment and travel benefits, profit sharing, work life balance and most importantly for me the culture is top notch"
good,"This is a great company to work for overall. The benefits are amazing and the culture is unmatched. I mean who doesn't like free travel? The only downside is having to commute if you are not able to get into a base near you. I am from Atlanta, which is a senior base. I have been told it could be 10+ years before I can be based at home. If you are in areas like Orlando, Atlanta, or Phoenix, be prepared to move."
good,"On a typical day, I would develop, troubleshoot and/debug codes in .NET applications (ASP.NET / C# / VB.NET) (using framework 4.x, 3.x and 2.x) for AirTran’s reservation system."
good,"Working for Southwest, it is true that the culture is everything. You have to work hard but play just as hard. You can build amazing relationships and have fun at the same time"
good,"I love working for SWA!!! I work as a part time  CSA and it has been a wonderful experience. The only difficulty that I've experienced is trying to move into a professional role in the Corporate Office. Other than that; if you love to travel, SWALIFE is it!!!"
good,"Fun place to work but limited advancement opportunities. Great co-workers. Need better management skills, little time for training. There are fun activities to do but if the activities are done during the day, the work still needs to get done. Which means you are then working from home or overtime hours that do not count as overtime if you are a salary employee."
good,"you must clean everything, especially where customers can see. All garbage must be collected and thrown away. The computer monitors must be free from streaks and keyboards clean from dust. restrooms must be sterilized and resupply."
good,Although general sales was not my calling I do sometimes regret not staying with a company that cared so much about their employees. They provided all of their workers with a great benefit packag along with free air fare.
good,"•	Installed and Configured WebSphere Application Server 7.1 and IBM HTTP Server 7.1 on Red hat Linux&AIX."
good,"South west was a Great Job to have if you love to Travel, and got a thing for planes.  Great Place to start a career. Many people have been there for many years, and love to help, and share their experiences."
good,"Great work culture, environment. Fantastic learning experience. Have lots of care for Employees. SWA has 40 years of profitability and is ever growing with multiple project openings for Developers and Business Analysts."
good,"It was a great working environment, loved working outdoors and everyone worked together as a team to get all the flights and bags out safely.  Hardest part about the job was making sure you dont brake anything, however the most enjoyable was pushing out the planes and being a bag runner.  I learned to be mindful of your surrounding at all times and that being on time is everything.  Management always wanted you to succeed no matter if you're having a bad day or not"
good,"SWA is very much a family airline.  Fun is always mixed in with the daily business.  It has given me to opportunity to meet so many different people in different environments and has given me experience in many different areas.  As a flight attendant I can be called upon to be a nurse, travel agent, babysitter, scheduler, safety inspector, police officer, receptionist or counselor.  I enjoy working alone or with my crew as both are requirements.  Enthusiasm and a positive attitude are something I always bring to the job, and are part of making it a pleasant work experience for not only myself and co-workers but my passengers as well."
good,Great work environment where you can have fun and work hard.  Learned a lot about the aviation industry while working in several different departments.
good,my day was getting to my work on time and do my assignment. i learn a lot to clean and be on task of different type of areas.learn how to work in groups and get a long with others. my hardest thing to do was to vacuum underneath the seats. i always enjoyed my job because i use to like it.
good,great job and company. job requires you to be ready when planes are late and when they all land at the same time .work safe and good commutation with co-works is important to get the job done. best part is knowing you have done your best for the customer for a good experience  and safe flight.
good,There  was also a shift to be covered so I never had to worry about not getting hours.
good,"Worked as general ledger accountant for payroll, benefits and maintenance accounts. Performed daily tasks as well as month end and year end closing."
good,"I actually enjoy working at Southwest airlines. The people are great, and I appreciate the services offered."
good,Very productive workplace. You're able to interact and communicate with coworkers and management. Everyone is very nice and you create a unique bond with the staff. It is physically demanding since it does require a lot of lifting.
good,"The Team and Management are very good especially the Manager who was supportive of the task that needs to meet the deadline."
good,"Great culture, friendly environment. Pay could be better but the benefits make up for it. Senior leadership is very engaging and supportive. Promotions are fairly easy to come by."
good,"I like the job, fast paced and free to roam about. plenty of availability to pick up shifts and give away shifts. I don't know about the management too much. The hardest part f the job is trying to get the planes out on time with the amount of bags that come off the plane."
good,Great company to work for and great people to work with. The great thing about this job is the flexibility in shifts and the ability to move up with in the company.
good,"This was a fun, but fast paced job.  I would return to work here, but needed to make more money. The managers and coworkers were very nice and team work is a necessity."
good,I just wish starting pay was more. I broke my back picking up hours to survive which came back to bite me in the butt cause I messed up my attendance out of pure exhaustion. Then got fired from my dream company.
good,"Fun atmosphere I enjoyed the culture of the company. There was a long waiting period ""probation"" period with the customer relations department that prevented  you from moving up."
good,"The job is hard but rewarding.  Its mostly hard labor, but if you can tough it out the first 3 years, you're pretty much set.  Raises come every year and there's more overtime than you can shake a stick at."
good,I interned at SWA as a tax intern in 2016. It was the best intern experience of my professional career. I learned alot of my made long lasting relationships with my team.
good,"Paid training. Fast- paced and at times stressful, but good company culture which is motivating and rewarding. Good benefits including free travel when space is available."
good,The work day was simple and easy. Just pay attention to the new additions and requirements at every team meeting. Co workers are helpful and your leads are great coaches when you need help. It was a great place to be.
good,"The ability to work around life events. Friendly work atmosphere, and peers. Opportunity for growth and development. Flight benefits for immediate family is a huge plus, as well as friend flight passes."
good,"Excellent place to work, just wasn't for me. SWA has excellent benefits. Typical day at SWA is taking calls, booking flights, changing flights or accommodating passengers if their flights get delayed or cancelled.  Depending on your shift you could get mandatory overtime or you can voluntary overtime when offered.  They are union based, so your raises very a couple of times a year.  Just make you that you can handle back to back calls.  The culture at SWA is amazing.  The hardest part of my job was getting yelled at and cussed at when flights were cancelled or delayed due to some inevitably reason."
good,"The mission of Southwest Airlines is a dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit"
good,Working for SWA was an wonderful opportunity. I loved working for SWA the only reason I left was due to the fact I gave birth to my son and I was nursing. I would love to one day go back and work for this amazing company
good,"Quick pace with time in between flights. Local culture team helped put on celebrations. Lots of room to grown within the company, at a local level and move to headquarters."
good,"There are many benefits for working with southwest. the pay is fantastic, retirement match cant be beat. you will work for every penny. there is a lot of overtime durring the busy season. balancing family and manditory overtime is  very hard."
good,New managers are too concerned with numbers and have basically destroyed the environment that Herb developed.  Old school employees are not as appreciated as before and Station managers will do whatever is necessary to get their yes men in as sups and replace the more experience ones that will call them on bad decisions
good,Lots of work at Southwest but great group of guys to work with and management is helpful and friendly. Work hard but play hard as well. Looking forward to many years at this company
good,A really good company to work at. great easy going culture and lots of benefits especially free flights!!! the internship program at southwest is one of the best!
good,"A typical workday could consist of thinking outside of the box to urgently execute decisions to work in a professional and friendly fashion with our customers. If irregular operations presented, our workplace culture afforded us the opportunity to use our disgression to do right by our loyal passengers. The most difficult part of the job were the work hours. We would bid based on seniority and regular shift were 4 a.m.-noon and noon-9:30 p.m."
good,"The company is extremely fun."
good,In Customer Relations you would deal mainly with escalated customer situations via phone or email. This department is located at Southwest Airlines headquarters and speaks on behalf of the executive office. Management was very professional and took a personal interest in their employees. The workplace culture was amazing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the challenging and sometimes difficult and unpleasant customers when trying to help resolve their problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers. Southwest Airlines treats everyone in the office like family.
good,Fun company to work for with a great culture. The employees are your brothers and sisters. Challenging at times and very fast paced around the holidays.
good,"it is a good place to work with.it is a good place. located in pheonix, az. environment is very good. work is reasonable . management and calleage were very helpful."
good,"Working in this company was great . I got to work on individual project and good guidance from my lead researcher."
good,Loved this job the company name speaks for itself heavy emphasis on Customer Service and PEOPLE as well as Employee Appreciation!
good,If you looking to build a career. Southwest is definitely the place to be. The benefits is wonderful. It just takes a while for your hourly income to raise up.
good,"Southwest Airlines (SWA) is an excellent company to work for. The atmosphere is unparallelled in my experience, and I have never seen the commitment and support that I received at any other company that I have worked for. Management was both supportive and appreciative of their employees efforts, trusting them to be professional and to do the job, rather than punch a clock. SWA has clearly stated long term goals and growth strategy but, like every company, their are days that are challenging. That said, it is truly a team effort and everyone pulls together to get the job done. Also, management always recognizes their teams efforts and rewards them appropriately."
good,Work when you want. Southwest Airlines has no minimum or maximums so you can work as much or as little as you want as a flight attendant. Most days are long 10-12 hours is usually with 3-day trips. You work between 1-5 flights a day. Better flexibility and pay the longer you are here.
good,"This company by far is the best one of worked at yet, the people, the setting, even the very atmosphere of it brings a bit of familiarity that alot of companies ive been with have lacked"
good,"I enjoyed each day there, from the travel to the customers and friends . it can get hectic and stressful at times but it was always someone there to help you."
good,"Loved southwest, they were a great place to work, but I got injured on the job and could no longer continue. But it was a great company to work for!!!"
good,It is a friendly environment to work in and employees have a lot of benefits. They have weird open floor plans that leave you surrounded but you can deal with it
good,"The workplace culture is the same as it has been for the past 45 years, since the company was founded.  The best part of the job can also be a downside eventually if you're not ready to spend LOTS of time away from home and family.  However, the schedule is so flexible it's not difficult to be home for important family/personal events.  Would definitely recommend SWA for anyone interested in getting paid to travel and expand personal horizons."
good,"Great Culture, Great Leaders, Great Teammates, beautiful work environment, very nice overall benefits package, lower than average salary - (take home pay)."
good,"Worked as a Flight Attendant for 9.5 years. Amazing company. Great benefits, great pay. Trading schedules is easy. You have to be able to adapt very quickly in order to survive at any airline. You never really know what any day will throw your way. As Flight Attendant, you usually work with different people every week. This can be tough for some people as you don't always get along with who you are working with. Over all, the worst part of this company is how hard it is to get hired. Most people get their foot in the door with an entry level position on the ground until they have a year of service under their belt and can transfer over to another department."
good,"Demanding, yet very rewarding.  Very busy, and very structured, sometimes repetitive, but our customers were almost always pleasant and appreciate.  My co-workers were my family, sometimes spending more time at work than an home during peak travel times.  The most difficult part of the job was the sitting for 8-12 hours a day, which could be more exhausting than physical labor."
good,"awesome company to be an employee"
good,"A typical day would be traveling from city to city while taking care of customers and staying in some beautiful hotels. The best part of the job was taking care of the customers and being able to see beautiful cities across the country. The hardest part of the job was being away a lot, making it difficult to have any personal relations.Work culture was very much encouraged."
good,"I worked as ramp agent I transferred cargo and passengers’ baggage from aircraft to aircraft and/or to the terminal and operates and drives motorized equipment such as belt loaders, air start units, lift trucks, tugs, bag carts, lavatory carts and de-icing units."
good,a typical day at work would be loading and unloading planes. was a great place to work had good employees and was an overall fun and great environment to work in.
good,"management was great, culture excellent and advancement opportunities endless!"
good,"Work is well balanced with fun. Employees at Southwest Airlines are very friendly, casual dress with decent outfits allowed, flexible timings and fun events"
good,"The most enjoyable part of an Operations and Security Position is the impact your communications skills have bringing together the ramp, flight crew, operations and passengers. Preplanning weight and balance and communication are keys to on-time departures."
good,very hard working company that cares about employees just as much as their customers
good,"Everyone is so kind and loving--it truly feels like a family, and I know that my coworkers value me as a person as well as my contribution. However, the company doesn't show how much they value their workers through compensation--pay is pretty low, and in the technology field, it ain't going to cut it."
good,While employed at Southwest Airlines the company showed great appreciation to its employee's. Im grateful for the opportunity that they have granted me. I left the company as a ramp agent with an internet to return as an airline pilot.
good,Great place to work. Free flight benefits provided . Training is very good and complete. Lots of locations to work at and numerous positions available.
good,"This is a great Company to work at. Probably one of the best to be at and the people and the culture is just brilliant. I learned a lot here, and it's mostly about how to treat people at work and how to make everyone happy along with the technical skills,"
good,"Cada día es diferente en este medio, el aprendizaje es continuo y nuevas herramientas de trabajo son aplicadas constantemente para mejorar nuestra atención al cliente, optimizar el uso de la flota y garantizar un ambiente seguro de trabajo."
good,The environment was great the work ethics are great. The environment was great . The workers were happy and had great things to say. The schedule was great and they worked with your school schedule.
good,"•Greeted passengers, verified tickets and directed passengers to assigned seats."
good,"I love this company they really cares about their employers . Very great benefits, fun things to do though out the year like company parties and much more"
good,Casual and professional environment. Management was easy going and a pleasure to work with. Hours were flexible with co-workers willing to assist in all necessary ways. Friendly environment was a joy to work in
good,To many questions and answers   about how they try the employees but they dont trying to listen the employees  so that's the  only bad thing I can say
good,Southwest hires some great people and is great to work for. If you don't live up to their expectations as work and home life they will boot you from your employment. Never met a company that wants to tell you how to live your life but that's the SWALIFE
good,"While Southwest is an excellent company, the Las Vegas station ground operations is a nightmare to work for. There is no concern for your work/life balance or your personal well being. Do yourself a favor, stay in flight operations and steer clear of ground operations."
good,"It is a very laid back environment. it is a revolving door, lot of people come and go. Good working place to learn, Lot of contractors and few regular full time."
good,"It was good , I have put in 12 to 14 hours on a daily basis "
good,Free travel but standby is not a certainty. The job is demanding and the constant chemicals is the only dislike. Management is pressing but you must do your job by the manuals.
good,I'm not providing a specific review other than be prepared to be paid well be low market rates and struggle for the first 7-9 years because union contracts are 11years to top out.
good,your day can be really good or really bad depends on the people around you not all are good and sadly the bad out weight the good . I have seen a lot and not in a good way but if your focused and determined and have a goal you will be ok just stay to your self and keep your personal life to you self.
good,"Great company to work for, I loved my job because I was able to coach/mentor and help employees when in need. I liked to volunteer which there were lots of opportunities to do so. With my tenure of experience I was a good asset to the company. I would reward my employees by positive reinforcement and try to boost the moral by showing them that they did a great job, which the company strongly supports with Kick-Tails. I would give daily challenges to the crews, not only to boost teamwork, but to give the best Customer Service internal/external customers."
good,"Southwest Airlines has a history of being a fantastic employer; and in many ways they are. Imperfect, yes; but corporately their ""heart"" is in the right place. If the requisition for Ramp Supervisor was anywhere but LAS, I would not hesitate to recommend you submit your resume'.  But not in LAS...  Sadly, entrenched management - and far too many ""mid-level managers"" striving to justify their existence; has resulted in a 'management mess' that the ramp supervisors have to deal with daily. The managers have little or no understanding of ramp operations, the few who have worked the ramp did so, so many years ago, as to make their experience more detrimental than beneficial. That, in combination with 'CYA'; makes the job much more difficult than is necessary. They will pay lip service to their supervisors-but not listen to suggestions to improve the operation. They are 'stuck' where they are in their own career, and thus have little or no interest in furthering yours. Much like the saying...""at the end of your rope? tie a knot and hang on.""  The recent merger with AirTran has made many feel either threatened or proud (for the wrong reasons) and the 'blending' of the companies is hostile at best, in LAS, BWI, MDW, and ATL.  That, in combination with a unionized workforce that has not been able to sign a new contract (still in negotiation...) since 2010 or '11; has put the non-union ramp supervisors in the role as ""bumpers"" between the ramp and management; and thus usually ""hung out to dry"". You will get little or no back up from your managers, there are probably only 1 or 2 MROs"
good,Good place to work for the flight benefits but hard to advance from  cs & s. Not much work life balance shift is bidding and based off seniority so it can be stressful nor working the hours or days you want.
good,flexible work enviornment  steady teamwork very diverse relax atmosphere no day is the same working around aircraft paid training can relocate and transfer
good,"Varies on a daily basis. "
good,"Great co-workers, all friendly people, managers are horrible they have zero clue how to staff a flight line and wonder why we have delays on occasion."
good,"prior to 9/11/01, it was the best company ever to work for, part or full time. then things changed. I believe it is back to being a good company again"
good,You can work as much as you like... just don't miss a shift!!! Very flexible with shift trades... not an easy job if you have small children.... as long as your mind is set on what you are there to do you'll be fine.... it can be your stepping stone to just about ANY job with SW
good,"A typical day was to book flight for customers,quote fares, rent cars,and hotels if needed and general flight info. "
good,"A very fast pace environment, thus making decisions on the spot was learned very early during my career. The hardest part of the job was interacting with the top Union Leaders. On various ocassions we had to ""agree to disagree"". And although it was the ""hardest"" aspect of my job, it taught me to be a good listener and to always offer options when seeking a solution."
good,"Hey- it's Southwest...what's not to like? It's a great Company, wonderful Culture, diverse People, and always exciting. Excellent benefits. Not for anyone wanting to make a lot of money- but if you must work for an airline, this would be the one to choose."
good,They have Great benefits / the union really look out for you. You basically can make your own schedule and free flights ....................:::::.:.:::
good,I start at this company 8 years ago and they are great on every employee. I want to learn and advance my knowledge in order to share more experience in this company l.
good,"I love the benefits and being able to say that I work for an amazing company that can offer you lots of opportunities, but working at the airport has zero work life balance. The job is all seniority based and union controlled so you will have to work for 15 or 20 years to be off on weekends and holidays."
good,Taught me a lot throughout the country. Safety and comfort and the best service that you could give to a passenger. Assistance for handicap passengers.
good,Loved the community aspect of the company. You have the ability to take care of your family with positive co-workers to assist along the way. Great COMPANY OVERALL!
good,The company is an overall good company but it has its pros and cons like all businesses.  So people treat it as just a job and others treat it as their career.
good,SWA is the place which is a friendly environment and here is the place I can learn everything and most of the ppl are very helpful to learn new things and moreover it will help us a lot to my career and we used to have a lot of production deployments in the night time and it is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job in my career till now. if I got a chance to work there again definitely go and work there again.
good,"I have worked with Southwest airlines for 11 years. They are a great company to work for, and i recommend them to any one. My decision to leave was due to a career change."
good,"Southwest Airlines expected you to be on top on your job requirements. FAA, TSA, DOT, and safety issues related to handling hazards situations related to hazmat and health of passengers whom might suffer emergency health problems. Requirements stringent to insure regulations followed with no exceptions. Safe and fun atmosphere as Southwest Airlines treated us as family and we did the same to each other."
good,Southwest is the BEST and i love working here.  Management is amazing and the company truly is like a family. The hardest part is being away from home.  The best part is getting to travel.
good,"The culture at Southwest Airlines is very much about treating the employee with respect, and appreciation. Each employee is treated with the same respect as the CEO."
good,I truly enjoyed working here and learned an enormous amount regarding managing People as a capital investment with employee engagement and culture being first and foremost to every SWA employee starting with the leadership.
good,"SWA is a strong growing company that is interested in their employees and encourages all to excel and succeed. "
good,everything you've heard about Southwest Airlines is true- they truly do care about their people and strive to make work a happy environment with excellent work/life balance
good,benefits are phenomenal.   The upward mobility was a little challenging but it's been quite a while since I worked there.   I still have friends that have amazing opportunities there.
good,"Southwest Airlines has been one of the best companies I have worked for. I worked with the most supportive, kind and hardworking team. I have never felt as comfortable in a work environment as I did at Southwest."
good,"Southwest is a leading airlines based in Oakland California."
good,Southwest airlines is the best place to work for. They give free flights to all their employees all over the country. They have one of the best work cultures.
good,I am glad to work with them. It was the best opportunity for me. The environment was really good. The management was very good. I would love to work with them again.
good,I had a wonderful time in the few moths I spent at Southwest and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to enter the airline field. There are a variety of teams with many wonderful qualities.
good,from management to employees almost everyday you come to work it was like a family atmosphere. which i loved during my time working for this company. would recommend anyone looking to work for the an airline company to choose this company
good,"I worked in a call center and it was the best! I loved it and SWA was always good to us. Everyone especially my supervisors were just awesome. I would have loved to had stay with them but my commute became long distance when I was transferred.  Unfortunately there was no way around it,"
good,Flexible hours with a great team group.  a typical day was scheduling flight reservations. along with accommodating hotel and rental car reservations.  enjoyed getting to fly free on my days off.
good,"United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home.

good,"My time as a flight attendant for Southwest Airlines was filled with excitement and adventure. To be trusted with the safety and security of approximately 200 people gave me an enormous sense of pride. I knew that Southwest would not hire anyone who did not possess a combination of both exceptional customer service skills and the ability to maintain control of the entire cabin in the event of a life-threatening emergency. At Southwest, safety and customer care are of utmost importance because providing it's passengers the best of these is how the company became one of the most successful airlines in the industry. It is a company of people who understand the  need for serious attitudes toward safety, yet also understand the inherent fun and adventure that traveling provides. I feel honored to have had the experience there."

good,Southwest Airlines is by far the best company that i have ever worked for. From the employees to the management even to the job criteria.

good,"I obviously enjoyed this job because I did it for 14 years.Making reservations for a airline is challenging and rewarding. I always felt like I was helping and making a differerance. Especially if you had someone elderly or who was not computer savy, I could walk them through our on line site and show them how to get the best fair."
good,"An awesome company to work for. There never was a typical day at work in the airline business. Every day and every hour have the potential to be totally different because of so many factors such as weather, mechanics, airplane destinations, airplane problems, etc. I learned to think on my feet and to always expect the unexpected. The hardest part of the job was working in all different elements of weather but you quickly get used to it and it becomes second nature. The most enjoyable part of the job are the free flight benefits!!"

good,It was fast-paced with high customer service focus.  i enjoyed the interaction with the customers.  it was never the same day twice.  great company culture.
good,"I liked my role and responsibilities, it just sucks that three days before my 6 month evaluation, I was informed I would not be continuing. I had achieved 100% or close to such scores in my exams, such as the Airport code test, HAZMAT course and duties performed; ticketing reservation systems etc... I would love to still be there, but one of the actual airport managers of SWA, took it upon themselves not to like me, thus a power imbalance, and it being easier for me to leave and pursue my other independent contractor positions."
good,Great Company to work for . Amazing benefits and fun culture. If you like to travel this is the job for you. How ever you will work long hours sometimes  16-27 hrs in a day if the weather is bad. also your schedule is always changing and one month you might work early mornings then the next late nights. Great company if you can go with the flow.

good,the company is an amazing place to work. everyone loves to play around make the customer happy the holidays are the best. they take care of their employees they put them first.

good,"This was a contract position (3 years) through TEK Systems. There were no benefits with Southwest Airlines, but TEK Sys had health and life insurance available."
good,It would be a book if I explained it all.  I loved my job very much and I gave my life and soul to SWA.  SWA as a whole is the most incredible Company to work for.  Where I was the Culture was not SWA Style.
good,"Being a flight attendant at southwest airlines is fun, full of life and exciting. The people are great and it's a great company. Management needs to be looked at, besides that I would recommend it."

good,The starting pay is not all that great for the first 4 years but after is worth the job.    Benefits are the one of the best across the country.  I enjoy what I do and looking to advance or grow with Southwest
good,Great job. Greet Passengers and assist with safety related regulations. Looking to add a part time gig to help with added expenses due to the decrease of  aircraft in the fleet.
good,"I absolutely loved my internship with Southwest during the summer of 2018. I would love to work for Southwest full-time, but unfortunately for me they don't often have communication, marketing or public relations positions available. Guess everyone who already works there realizes how awesome it is and doesn't want to leave. Can't blame them!"
good,"I absolutely loved  SWA. Sadly my son was extremely sick and I called off. When I did, I did it incorrectly and was terminated  I worked hard, received many kudos and had a clean record otherwise. I’ve since tried to reapply and I can’t ever get past the first interview.... which tells me I’m not rehire-able. Sad they can’t give other opportunities!"
good,"Working for an airline can be very rewarding you meet people from all walks of life who at times are quite interesting. Every day is a brand new day,  always changing, yet repetitive. I always made it fun not only for me but for my passengers as well."
good,SWA is a great place to work.  They have an fantastic vision statement focusing primarily on how to take care and build a great team.  Hiring process take a long time but they want nothing but the best future employees to join their team.
good,I enjoyed working at Southwest Airlines their training program was phenomenal and the emphasis on teamwork is awesome. They focus on time management and there is little flexibility.
good,Southwest is a good company. I just would like to take my job skills and experience that I have an move up into a leadership role. I’m well deserved for the opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work can be challenging and rewarding. You work a eight and half hour shift, you are required to stand for your shift except when on breaks"

good,"South west is a best place to work.I enjoyed working  in southwest,l worked as a test lead ,where i gained more experience in handling team and cordinating with them."
good,Very good company. Management is all about numbers and not worried about his workers likes to work short we merged with AirTran and feels like all there leadership our here and running us a lot different then we use too. Lying to are customers takeing one bag off and running it so it shows that we have good drop times when in reality the rest of the bags won’t be there for 10 mins. Trying to make us like all the other carriers not worried about maintenance on our aircrafts. List go on. A lot has changed.
good,Great place to work where having fun is encouraged.  The customers were fun and the employees were even better.  I miss my coworkers as they had become a large part of my life.
good,Southwest Airlines is a exciting place to work.  I enjoyed my job there.  I would return there permanent if provided the opportunity.  I found the job a great challenge
good,"Southwest Airlines is a "
good,Great Place as long as you have the union behind you. The management stab you in the back with a smile on their face. I loved going to work every day but I watched how they treated the older employees. Sad
good,"A person looking for a career in the commercial airline industry should definitely work for Southwest Airlines.  I had the  opportunity to work with the greatest people, all hardworking and helpful.  My colleagues made work enjoyable and provided a positive environment.  There is job flexibility, and for many positions  there is union backing."

Some of these being, helping customers with any and all inquiries, announcing gate and flight information, and baggage handling. "
good,A typical day at work consist of me helping customers with their flight information or their Rapid Rewards accounts. I learned how to give the best customer service and how to keep our customers happy. My co-workers always had a way of keeping things positive and keeping the mood light. The hardest part of the job was the unpredictable phone calls. You never know what you're next conversation was going to be or who it was going to be with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the co-workers I had and the company overall was always doing things to show their appreciation and keep the moral up.
good,"Intern paid fair, since work is not hard. Great culture and environment. Good people and boss."
good,"My typical day was early and long. Answering sales calls in a call center environment; assisting passengers with their reservations; trouble shooting on-line reservation issues for passengers; resolving disputes, issues or poor customer service problems. The most difficult part of the job was unhappy passengers and trying to assist them in resolving the issues at hand while keeping a smile in my voice and making sure they want to return to SWA for future travel. The holidays were the most enjoyable. Customers were generally happy and traveling for fun."
good,"I made daily schedules for employees. Verified attendence and payroll statuses.Would make rounds to check on emplyee productivity, be available to assist frontline employess to resolve problems such as, unhappy Customers, baggage issues, irregular operations, weather and mechanical delays."
good,It is difficult to have a work- life balance. It is a great company to grow and develop  in any department . This company have great medical benefits and 401k .
good,This was an awesome company to work for. Flexible schedules due to shift trade options. Overall this is one of THE BEST companies you could ever work for.
good,"Great company to work for however each location has its good/bad. When I started 10 years ago it was a fun job, when I left it wasn't so much fun. The customers are different, mostly rude. It is very physically demanding and lots of heavy lifting. Agents are always getting hurt somehow."
good,"Preparing staff for flight assignments, ensuring aircrafts depart on-time, safely. Assisted in the day to day operation and ensuring daily/monthly goals are met."
good,"Company is an amazing company to work for. Great benefits,  schedules can be rough with family,  some choices/ sacrifices have to be made. Benefits cannot be beat."
good,Excellent company with great benefits. One day off with pay each month (Jan.-Oct) for my position. Biggest down side when I worked there was mandatory overtime.
good,Had  a great time working there !! The schedule flexibility is really fun as you can make your work schedule look any way you need to with all the day/hours swapping allowed !!
good,The culture was great and the organization strives to have a balanced culture. The is a sense of belonging and a chance to learn new things. The area I'm familiar with was finance.
good,"Coworker are friendly and very helpful. The pay was less than desireable.The shifts where  inconsistent, overtime is mandatory.Flight privileges is a plus."
good,"I had my internship here. culture was the best! loved the coworkers and leaders. "
good,"you will get lots of extra hours"
good,Great fun environment  can be stressful  must be flexible great compensation and competitive pay great retirement benefits. Everyone flies free immediate family only
good,"As an employee it is great to work here; however the managers are usually a little crazy.  They do not communicate well together that leads to the operation at the phoenix Station not running smoothly. They throw supervisors and ramp agents under the bus for projects and tasks that they have you do.  While they expect you to be lenient on them they  usually end up writing people up quickly.  The company as a whole is actually really great.  I fly the world and the USA if there is a seat open o our flights.  I enjoy the flexibility of trading shifts between fellow ramp agents or giving away shifts.  For example I work an 8 hour shift Friday, !6 hour on Saturday, and a 16 hour on Sunday to get Monday - Thursday off.  Paid time off, Paid free days, and double time for mandatory over time and time and half for voluntary overtime."
good,There is always something to celebrate! The culture here for the most part is very inviting and respectful of differences. I Luv our CEO Gary Kelly he is a real hands on CEO.
good,Manager liked to promote from the people willing to kiss but instead of be honest and hard working.  Lots of the move the company forward jobs going to young out of college kids who have zero practical experience.  Causes extra work and no benefit.
good,"I worked in the Technical Support Department.  We took calls from workers that had computer, printer or jetway problems.  We were able to reachout to their computer and fix problems, or walk them through how to fix things."
good,I will say that the culture at SWA is bar none.  The management cares and there is always someone trying to help you maintain your stats and achieve the goals that are set before you.  Plenty of opportunities to enjoy your benefits.  While the job itself can be stressful at times it still has its rewarding moments.
good,Truly depends on what team you on on.  Overall company culture is good.  In IT area they hire mainly contractors. Southwest has more applicants yearly than Harvard and some times they feel people and talent are expendable
good,"Working for a airline can always be intricate and challenging daily. The irregular nature of a day, and the labor workforce can really give managers tools to move on with their career and be successful."
good,"There aren’t too many things as an employee that you could ask for from Southwest: comfortable uniform that is in David by most in the industry, great travel benefits, great support from fellow coworkers and management, and an exciting pace.  I couldn’t tell you how many times was in the shower. I was there that it would seem to be a low, and then you look up, and it’s the end of your shift already! They are also very few places where you get to work at and are encouraged to have fun with the customers. That was made very clear from the outset, especially at training. It’s a company with a great history, and  One that fosters just as much of a legacy for his penchant for value and great service."
good,"If you're looking for entry into the airline industry there is no better place to start than Southwest. The compensation isn't great, but it's certainly on par with other employers. Other benefits are great and it being a union job with all of the security that entails is also welcome. Not to mention the best benefit of all, the flight benefits. Free, unlimited Stand-by flying for you and others."
good,Love the company and would definitely recommend working working with and retiring with this company! Best company i've with and for. Of course the benefits are great too!
good,"Southwest Airlines is a fantastic company that offers great benefits.  If you can last long enough in the call center, the pay is pretty good, too (tops out at about $30/hour after about 10 years).  The starting pay is weak, though, at only about $13/hour, and it takes a while before you make much more.  A typical day at work consists of arriving at least 15 minutes early, so you can log on to your computer and all the different programs you will be using.  Next you will plug your headset in and start taking calls.  You will be attached to that headset and computer ALL DAY, with breaks about every two hours.  Thankfully, most customers are happy with us, and are just calling to change a flight reservation or similar."
good,"If you like to fly the benefits here are amazing.  401k match is highest I have ever seen at a company.  Large, growing company with a great reputation."
good,"Friendly people very spirited bunch. Mandatory overtime is almost everyday if you work at the call center, but they do try to make it fun. Management at the call center is okay, but isn’t very helpful."
good,"Depending on the time of your shift, it varies by how busy it is. Time is strict. Every minute of your day is scheduled. The benefits are great. When off the clock, you can volunteer for great events."
good,"According to my review , southwest Airline is a suitable company to work with, and its a very serious company and the management it is organized their services are good and they are attractive."
good,"Although the company overall is a wonderful company, at my current location it is a hostile work environment because of aggressive, inconsistent, poorly trained managers who have no clearly defined guidelines or experience in the industry."
good,"It is a great company to work for.  The Senior Leadership does an okay job looking out for their own employees.  Its an awesome job when the weather is nice, but when its raining hard or blowing snow with 0 degree temperatures.  Not so much."
good,"Working as a contractor was very rewarding.  I worked on a small project but loved the interaction and overall culture.  The company is very structured in all its operations, functions, etc. and was refreshing to have clear direction and expectations.  Great place to work!"
good,Working at this company you become apart of a family and they treat there employees extremely well. They have several company events in several different cities that employees are able to attend as long as you're not scheduled to work that day.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a great company to work for.  They have great employees, a positive work philosophy (LUV) and empowerment to give customers the best possible service.    Training is a joy, stress is minimal."
good,"great job. I could make as much money as I wanted.  Union atmosphere.  The few great workers do all the work, and most barely show up."
good,"Southwest is a great company to work for.  They have a great culture of fun, and show a lot of support for their employees.  The call center environment is a bit rough, but if you can get your foot in the door there, there are numerous opportunities for growth"
good,"Amazing company to work for. Very nice staff and people are really helpful. Leaders are easy to talk to and are ready to help whenever needed. Overall it is a nice company and I really like it,"
good,"Reason for leaving: Affected by outsourcing"
good,"Well a typical day at southwest start 3:45am with some of my ex co-workers sleeping wairing for the lead start the brifing. Then when we go to the counter we turn on turn on the compters and kioski as soon we finish with that we start calling the passanger normally familys moving to USA, with each passanger we check the USADA sticker, then we takes the bags to put the bag tags and senden to the belt as soon we finish with the bags, we give the boarding passes and explain the passange how they can go to the gates. In the time that we dont have any passanger we talk each other, making jokes, talking about the day before, family, pet and more things. When the shift ends normally we go all together to eat and then go home."
good,"the hardest part of the job was denied boarding do the last passenger to check in when we are not able to find volunters"
good,"I worked here for 3 years and I can't say anything bad about this company. They have a very relaxed culture, but if you don't do your job as expected, you will be informed that more is expected from you. "
good,"i learned alot from different co-workers, and management each and everyday. im real easy to communicate and to get along with."
good,To start out my day as an Ramp Agent was to find out what gate i was to work for that day. Getting my gate setup. Head over to Operations to get my flight schedule's as to when my flights out coming in and departing. I really enjoyed marshalling in the planes into the gate area as well as pushing the plaines out to the taxi lanes. (see resume for more information)
good,"I worked full time here, as a ramp agent, "
good,"This was the best airline job, the treatment from managers and company heads was amazing, the passengere were fun and the co-workers helpful."
good,"great oppurtunity and wonderful co workers, as a whole everyone understands and applies the saftey procdures to there everyday work which make everything easier .The hardest part can be the winter if you allow it to be,but as long as you dress warm everything is fine. the most enjoyable part i have to say is the flying benifits and the union department is just plain genius"
good,Baggage Claim services and wheel chair services. Help passangers check in to their gates.
good,Serve the customer to the very best of your ability.
good,"The typical day at Southwest Airlines includes logging on to your phone and being available to take inbound calls from a dialer system. Assisting customers when taking calls with travel plans or changes, websiste assistance, and with travel reward accounts."
good,Great company to work for long term. Great employees to work with.
good,In all southwest is one of the best companies you can ever for if you ever get a chance. It's all about enjoying what you do and making customers happy.
good,Southwest Airlines is a great place to work. as a ramp agent you get to live( work) mostly outside. the management was really willing to work with me.
good,"I loved working but didn't like the hours. It was seniority and i didn't have that so i got stuck with the worst shifts. pay and benefits good, but i wanted better hours"
good,Low pay starting out but increases over time. We have a casual work environment flexible schedule and flight benefits. It can get overwhelming when weather causes a flight to be cancelled
good,Great company. They ask a lot of their employees but the benefits are phenomenal. Hours can be long but you’re likely to find help from a team to collaborate on solutions
good,The shift bids are the most difficult thing to deal withstand Southwest Airlines. We have to bid for our shift every two months. We never know what shift we are going to get.
good,"APPLY! If you see an open position you qualify for apply. Best company to work for. Dollar for Dollar match, Profit Sharing, Free flights for you and you family."
good,"Encouraged to celebrate each other and our accomplishments. Able to give our cohearts kick tails for jobs we’ll done."
good,Great company to work for. As we all know 9/11 changed everything! Southwest Airlines is by far the best Airline to work for! They have great benefits
good,"Job overall was great. Hours not so much. If hours could have been worke out, I would still be there.Customer interaction was really fun and expected. Coworkers were the greatest and wukking to help out anytime with questions. Although I wasn't there long enough, there was plenty of opportunity for advancement and movement which was encouraged by management"
good,"A typical day at Southwest was fun, interesting with assignments that kept me busy with all passengers..I learned how to work with various cultures, religions, and disabled passengers. The Supervision was awesome, very helpful, wanted employee's to succeed with the company. Southwest has a very cultural environment. various cultural pot luck lunches, holiday activities. Hardest part of my days was having to turn someone down for missing their flight and scrambling to get them on another flight, especially with children. my most enjoyable part of the day, was clocking in, it was a feeling of being present to help passengers be happy and great to see the smiles on their faces."
good,"There isn't a typical day. Your day can change in a minute.  Hardest part is not knowing what to expect. Volunteering, committees, and traveling, fun."
good,"My experience with Southwest Airlines was generally good.  There was a good work/life balance and co-workers were considered to be like family.  Fun and freedom of expression is actually encouraged at work but proceed with caution for at heart, it is still a company with very conservative values.        "
good,Definitely a good company to work. I engaged with a lot of teams with little effort and having more advanced enterprise Agile. A great working culture.
good,swa is an awesome to company to work for I highly recommend it. the benefits are great and employees are a pure joy and if you are looking for hep people southwest is the place to be.
good,Good company to work for. Pay is good. Able to transfer to different stations/cities and different departments. Health benefits are good for families as well as travel benefits.
good,I developed and learned so much at Southwest Airlines and enjoyed my position and time there immensely. The Leadership Team at Southwest Airlines is one of the best in the industry and I appreciated the support and development I received from each of them.
good,"Some of the best people in the world. The management left something to be desired, but I have found that to be the case in most of my workplace environments."
good,Loved it but no pay.At my age it would have taken too long to advance. I couldn't really plan anything because I never knew if I would have to work overtime.
good,"When first starting you have to commit to working whenever the company wants as you are low man on the totem pole and there is mandatory overtime. However, once you get to learn the system and how it works, this is a very flexible job and worth every minute of mando. You have great co workers, and are trained extremely well."
good,"Daily work hours at southwest airlines (which is managed by GCG Ground Services, at the Sangsters internation airport) is a busy one. everything got to be done in a timely manner because everything as a cut off time."
good,"full of energy, safe environment to work for.fun, exciting fast paced .you can travel anywhere, awesome employees..The hard part is managing lunch breaks for the employees I work for. and the best part is getting all the incentives that they offer such as discounts,bonuses,401 k, profitsharing,etc."
good,"If traveling is your thing, the benefits alone will sell you on this company! Also, the culture is fun-luving and family-like. The bonds you make will last a lifetime."
good,You gain a lot of great experience in your field of study! Everyone works together and knows the companies mission and vision. Managers truly care about there employee's!
good,"Southwest is an awesome company that truly cares about their employees. The environment is pretty laid back and you're not micromanaged. If you remain professional while providing extraordinary customer service, you'll be successful."
good,Good working when onsite.  Not communicative when working remote.  Congenial co-workers.  Worked on contract.  Company brought me onsite to onboard me with my workgroup of 50 some odd folks.
good,"a typical day at work consists of answering a high call volume of inbound calls regarding flight bookings. i learned how to ensure i catered to each customers needs individually in such a remarkable way that by the end of the call my customers were very satisfied. The management was always very willing to help in any way they could and that is one thing i was really imoressed by was their heart. The hardest part of the job would have to be in the midst of a storm and we recieved non stop calls about canceled/delayed flights, but then being able to offer them support as well as reaccomadating them had to be the most enjoyable part about the job! It was such an amazing experience!"
good,If you're young and single it's the best first job or career you can ever have.  I learned so much about business.   It's almost the same business acumen anyone would learn at any top business Ivy League school.
good,I enjoyed working for Southwest in the recruitment department as their People Coordinator. The atmosphere and culture were very comfortable and fun. My co-hearts (co-workers) and I worked together in the office to make sure the daily duties were done and complete. We all got along very well.
good,"Enjoyed working there but rather be full time there. Just wished the valued their temp employees more, if so this would be a great place to work and thrive."
good,"worked like a dog during your junior time with the company, doesn't pay off until seniority raises fairly high. company takes care of you but the operations get rough at times."
good,"While this was a fun company to work for, there is a lot of discrimination that takes place.  Management does not support their employees.  The hardest part of the job was some days there were extra long hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility and the benefits."
good,"the pay is great, the workplace is usually good, the hardest part about this job would be the amount of hours you have to work and that leaves no room for a personal life."
good,"Anyone who has worked at SWA knows that the people there work hard and play hard.  The culture is family friendly and team centric.  The pay and benefits are not great, but your family can fly free!  Working in Marketing for the VP.  Our team was awesome!"
good,"You will work very hard, and there is always mandatory overtime, but the benefits are the best and the culture and people you work with are nothing short of a joy. Management can be a challenge. When there is weather and irregular operations (delays and cancellations) you will have to deal with irate people who will not be making their connections and you will have to rebook them or tell them they are not going to make it to their destination. There are other times when all is quiet and you have little to do, but your co worker will always make that fun."
good,"I always enjoyed my job at SW. I had fun and learned a lot. Many employees are dedicated to their core in the success of SW."
good,"Great place to work, you work hard but the pay is great"
good,Company needs to be more involved with the lowest level workers. Everyday we learn our new system operations. Many coworkers are lazy and are not willing to help others. The hardest part of the job is loading the freight and the poor attitudes.
good,"Ramp agents/baggage handlers are responsible for marshaling aircraft, and loading/unloading and sorting freight and baggage. Ramp agent/baggage handler duties also include servicing aircraft, assisting with aircraft pushback and towing, deicing and other duties as assigned. Many breaks in-between flights .   Hardest aspect of the job would be the physical pressure you endure on a day to day basis.    The most enjoyable aspect is the smiles you see from our customers"
good,You work harder in BUR due to the demands of the customers. Constant changing of shift hrs make it difficult to have a life. The lack of flights makes it difficult to work oversold flights.
good,They are a very good company.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good,"A day at Southwest Airlines is really cool. I meet new people every day. We just purchase another airline, I'm learning a lot from my new co-workers and our new management. My co-workers are very reliable and hard working. My job is not really hard just fast pace. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fun that we have at work while we are getting the job done."
good,"Planes come into the gate, bags and freight are offloaded, and then bags and freight are loaded onto the plane. De-Icing in De-Ice trucks. Fun people. Hardest part of the job is the wear and tear on the body."
good,"Manage the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly operation and people.  "
good,"Needed to be very flexible with work hours, but the benefits and environment was definitely woth it"
good,I love working for Southwest Airlines. I have held many positions and enjoyed each one. My only issue is I am having to commute from Oklahoma to continue working with the Company . I am ready to come home to be with my family.
good,"I love working for this company. They have a lot of fun on a daily basis and make the atmosphere for the employees enjoyable. There's never a dull moment, and they are always coming up with interesting and more innovative ways of builidng the moral within the company. This is a really great company to work for. It makes coming to work so much easier!"
good,"I worked for Southwest Airlines for 15 years!! It was the best, this company is the best to work for they take care of their people!! Working in Denver was difficult due to it being such a big station. I started out at the Tucson station and wished I would’ve have stayed there."
good,"Great working environment. Great culture and leadership development."
good,"Being a flight attendant is truly the best job in the world. You will never find a position that is more rewarding. If you have a servants heart, this is the job for you."
good,Interview was extremely easy. The job is interested in personality. The company is Family oriented. Job is laid back. A lot of room for growth. The people are amazing and the benefits are beautiful.
good,Might not be the best pay but definetely has the best people! My time at Southwest was the greatest because of the people and the great company culture!
good,"Great Company "
good,"Awesome place to work, but Cust Svc Reps are paid the least and they're the ones putting butts in seats. I worked there for 3.5 years and had to leave due to salary."
good,"Working at an Airline is both a blessing and a curse. You will never be paid as much as your counterparts at a similar job in a different industry. However, Southwest has an amazing work benefits package and they try to make it right. Flight benefits and a 9.2% 401k match is great. Just be prepared to make a little less but to have a lot more fun."
good,All I can say is that's a company that made my life begin and will never forget all the great times there. The culture of Southwest Airlines was just such a family felt operation that it just you as a person there want to give all you could to make sure the company remained a great success.
good,I loved my time at Southwest Airlines. They taught me so many skills and have so many opportunities. It’s a family culture company and it’s worth it. The people are great and the benefits are amazing.
good,"Typical day at work usually begins very early (before 5 am)"
good,"Great place to create a consistant  paycheck. "
good,"Very happy working for SWA. Room for advancement, relocation. Flight benefits are excellent. Also discounts on hotels, cruises, car rental etc. Company culture is very inclusive."
good,"I honestly love the job and the company. I was physically assaulted by a racist man, and ended up being out on leave and never got paid. i had to hire a lawyer and then i was terminated because southwest would not pay for counseling until it was court ordered and i would have panic attacks going back into the airport where the assault happened. And i was told i needed to come back to work!  No union reps reached out to me no management no one it was like poof she’s gone hire someone else.. i still am heartbroken because of how i was treated i wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I wish someone can help me with my situation and get my job back!!!! It’s totally unfair and goes against everything Southwest claims to stand for!!"
good,The People are amazing and lots of cultural events to take part in. Feels like a Family. Given empowerment in every day work. Competitive positions and skills.
good,"Company has an amazing work culture, great management, Tons of opportunity for growth and development, Fast Paced, Good pay, good benefits,Travel perks are amazing, really regretted resigning from company."
good,The Southwest Culture is great in training. Some of the airport locations need a refresher to ensure that they are reflecting that same energy. Peers were a great help throughout training
good,Its a great company to work for but I had a personal issue at home that was domestic relationship and they told me once I get things in order I can work with them again but I have done numerous applications and reached out to many people and they wont hire me back.
good,Fun place to work but you always need to be on your toes not to make any mistakes.When the tell you have overtime you can't denied it or you will get a point reach 9 and you are done.
good,"Engaging with employees laughing and smiling. Just acting silly with one another, being second family to one another. My plastic roach that looks real keeps us laughing. The hardest is dealing with delays and customers not being happy, the challenging part is turning them around to be calm. Key is taking time to listen and being concerned to there need. Its a win win when passengers are happy. Great workplace, just staying away from negative people can also be a challenge. Management is good just as long as you do what your suppose to do. After 29 years of lifting bags and getting older I look to the horizon of my upcoming years, I feel its time for a change. I know with all the experience I have with working with people I would be a great asset to the next company! Training me and I know I can do whatever it entails."
good,"Outstanding work environment and culture which results in very effective collaboration and problem solving.  Turnover at middle and senior levels is practically non-existent, which speaks to the quality of life."
good,I really enjoyed working at Southwest. The only issue I had were the assigned work hours. This was a second career job for me but would be ideal as an entry level position for someone because of the advancement opportunities afforded.
good,I'm actually sad that I left! This position was amazing! A great learning experience that I will never forget. Management was awesome. Co-workers great! Good hours.
good,I would recommend anyone to be a Flight Attendant with this wonderful company. Great benefits. Best contract! Best work environment. Scheduling is easy. Commuter policy is great. Lots of bases to chose from.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, it was a great place to grow and provide for a family. Providing you stay in a union covered department.  Great place to meet new people and create lifetime bonds."
good,Due to many issues I got sick and couldn’t do my job anymore.  I so want to go back to Southwest Airlines and work there again.   Honestly the best company in the world to work for.
good,I was intern and had to leave but would definitely go back if offered full-time. Great work environment and nice culture. They only hire you if they think you can fit in the culture.
good,"Fast paced fun loving energetic workplace.  It was an amazing company to work for and great experience with amazing benefits."
good,A typical work day was the same everyday. You knew who you could count on and who were the slackers. Management was lead by the nose by the union who were the workers.
good,great work relationship team in pitt. had to leave for high school coaching back in 2015. would like to return and work part time  late afternoon.hardest part morning. great management. great training.
good,"company has positive environment, but be cautious about which department you decide to work within.  the call center work isn't bad, but youd have to have a very inviting personality and be able to tolerate customers talking down to you.  management is not very likely to standup for you though they give the initial impression that they would."
good,"Southwest airlines is a great place to work however in the beginning to have a pay check where you can be self supportive you must work as many hours as you can pick up from others."
good,I loved my tenure at Southwest Airlines. My fellow employees are top-notch! The benefits provided by the company are second-to-none. I believe that Southwest Airlines takes care of their employees as well as their paying customers!
good,"A typical day at work would include checking for incoming tickets, returning phone calls, regulatory meetings, status reports and meetings.  When the basics are covered then discussions can take place regarding the plans for growth of the team goals.  "
good,"Southwest Airlines is a wonderful place to work. I've had two contracts there (in IT and SWA-U), which were 15 years apart. Over that time-frame everything changed facilities-wise, but the atmosphere of friendly camaraderie and family-like attitudes remained the same. "
good,"This was the funnest job I have ever had.  I dealt with people one on one, boarding flights, boarding issues, luggage issues, ticket issues and incoming and outgoing flights.  Many critical thinking skills were used and so was customer service."
good,"Fun job but can be stressful at times during flight delays,being away from home 3-4 days can be hard,required to leave your problems at homeTurbulence"
good,"Fast paced , hectic , stressful but yet fun at the same time. As a frontline leader your days were never the same but during irregular operations it was challenging at times but yet fun."
good,"This is a great company to work for overall. The benefits are amazing and the culture is unmatched. I mean who doesn't like free travel? The only downside is having to commute if you are not able to get into a base near you. I am from Atlanta, which is a senior base. I have been told it could be 10+ years before I can be based at home. If you are in areas like Orlando, Atlanta, or Phoenix, be prepared to move."
good,"Having never attained a degree, I didn't expect to find a job, much less a career.  Southwest is definately a careeer, and one I was very proud to tell others about.  "
good,"Worked for southwest 13 years  as a flight attendant, excellent employee. Company has much room for advancement. Many cities abe to relocate. Union pay. Contract renewed every. 2 Years. Many different personalities to meet for lifetime friends. Productive and fun."
good,"One of the best companies around. Had a blast working there. Compensated well for the sometimes odd hours. Benefits are amazing for healthcare, not to mention the flight perks."
good,Southwest Airlines is a great company to work for! The benefits are spectacular and the work culture is a ton of fun. The downside is low pay. They include flight benefits in your compensation.
good,Even though my job can be stressful at times it's still a fun place to work. I love the people I work with. I love the benefits we get monthly and annually.
good,SouthWest Airlines is the best job I ever had. The work place was very family oriented. The work was very fast paced an forever changing. If I get the chance I would love to work for SouthWest Airlines again.
good,I LUV my Co -Hearts and this is definitely an awesome place to work for! I started two years ago and already had the opportunity to get my feet wet in the training environment.
good,There were very few days that I didn't enjoy my time at work. We had a great team of agents at every location that I worked at. We had lots of fun and stayed busy so the days went by fast.
good,"This company has a fantastic Culture and CORE values.  I have worked for many airlines that boast a ""family"" camaraderie however this airline walks it's talk !!!  Training received and Management availability is second to none - Southwest is the best !"
good,"I've learned a lot about dealing with the public and how important it is not to take things personally when passengers are not friendly or agreeable.  I enjoy working with people and helping them, particularly the elderly and children.  We also have a high number of passengers with disabilities.  I feel it is an honor to serve them and to help their day become memorable and filled with joy.  Working with the military travelers is another significant honor.  I feel fortunate to have met so many heroes of our country including those who are WW I and II, Pearl Harbor and Desert Storm Veterans.  Our passengers are mostly fun and enjoyable and I have a great time serving them and making them laugh whenever possible.  The hardest part of this job is being away from home and not having a specific weekly routine.  It is a great company to work for and I enjoy this amazing opportunity to work for this company."
good,"This is one of the best working environment I experienced. The work is well organized. Adopting to latest technologies very often.  Management is very friendly. I was involve in several projects, and the teamwork was really important to make it a success."
good,"Being a flight attendant is perfect for someone with little or no ""responsibilities"" at home. A very difficult job to have a balanced home/work life if married with or without children. Can be very lonely if your crew is not outgoing."
good,The management and supervisors are great.  Being on the ramp and next to the planes all day or night is the best part of the job.  Seeing how the airline works from the time you check in to the time the plane leaves the gate is very interesting.
good,"Customer oriented, feel likes family. Learned that changes are inevitable. Management was available to help at all times."
good,working at swa when i started was one of the greatest jobs i ever had but as the years past co change and people change with it.
good,This was a call center. I would work anywhere from 8 to 12 hours a day but I enjoyed. When the call volume was low we would learn to crochet and donate the blankets to the needy.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a great company to work for. The culture of the company is very fun, loving and laid back. I worked at HQ as an intern and the halls of each building are filled with photos and the history of Southwest. It's difficult to get hired onto the company, but once you're in, you're in."
good,"Complete work load, monthly festive events, Hardest part of the job was the distance, Flexible scheduled work hour week (40 Hours)."
good,Loading and unloading aircraft. Great people to work around. However I'm not 19 anymore and wanted to get back into the customer service aspect of the airline. Working around the aircraft was enjoyable.
good,"Southwest Airlines is the world's largest low-cost carrier and 4th largest airline in the world by both passengers and passenger miles flown, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, USA. The airline started operations in 1971, currently has an estimated 44,831 employees and operates more than 3,400 flights per day carrying the most domestic passengers of any U.S. airline. Southwest Airlines currently has scheduled service to 93 destinations in 41 states, the Caribbean and Central America."
good,"South west is a great place to work for, anyone who is able to get on with this company, should be very excited and consider themselves lucky."
good,"A fun place to work, free travel for all employees. Very Family oriented."
good,"Benefits and compensation were very good. Health plan very affordable. Easy to pick up extra hours, and overtime as well. At the pay rate you find it very advantageous to make extra for those expenses we never plan for. Flying all over the country and with our partners around the world makes it very easy to see the world."
good,"I currently manage the co-branding partnership on the digital side of digital credit card acquisitions. I work with a team of 4 individuals, who, each work in different areas of Marketing for the Rapid Rewards credit card ad partners program. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to be fully involved in test & learn for digital content, which then impacts the company's overall financial performance."
good,"Learned a lot about project management, performance management, and leadership."
good,Typical day at work would be clocking in and waiting for your orders while watching TV and talking with co workers. after about thirty minutes you would Work on aircraft's and have a half hour lunch. I'm easy to get along with so all of my co works were a joy to work with. The most hardest part of my job was working over nights. The best thing working for SWA is the flight privileges.
good,A typical day at SWA was completed with high energy and fun. The co-workers are great people that embrace the SWA culture.
good,"This is a fun place to work that really allows you to learn, grow, and have fun. For me at least, every day is different. My coworkers and the management are both great. Everyone is very supportive."
good,a lot of customer sevice and phone work also computer some inter action with co-workers;most customer's were a joy to help
good,I work in an SAP COE support area. I maintain the organizational structure for the entire company as well as create positions on a daily basis.
good,"Great place to work, Busy call center environment. Family oriented culture with fun activities to keep employee engaged."
good,"A typical day is normally fast pace. Customer Service is the main focus, creating win win solutions to situations that my occur throughout the day. I learned that building relations with your team is the most important. People need to feel valued and establishing a fair but strict work environment creates results. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet the Customers needs and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work wtih."
good,"A typical day would start at 4:30 in the morning and you would have about 100 customers waiting for you to start your day. From then on, it's pretty much non-stop especially during peak seasons which is 8 months out of the year in Orlando, Florida. Like any job, there are good and bad days, but I think that you have to have a positive attitude."
good,Began very early
good,I liked working for this comany and all the perks/benefits. I travled a lot while there and th ebenefits out of pocket expenses were affordable.
good,"A typical day at Southwest Airlines would bring you a little bot of everything. You interact with 1000's of individuals everyday from all over the country. I learned how to deliever outstanding customer service. When you interact face to face every day with all different types of people, you learn quickly how to adapt and accomodate the needs of the passengers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with situations that were out of your control, but impacted your job directly. Such as Air Traffic Control delays, or Weather issues. All of these issues would create a lot of stress for myself and all of the passengers affected by the delays. The best part of the job was flying for free."
good,"Southwest Airlines was a great place to work. It was more like being with family than co-workers. There were times when days got a little rough, but we always got through them together with team work. They had great benefits such as free travel, 401k, profit sharing, dental, vision, medical etc...Sometimes the management and co-workers would seem like they didn't work for the same company. Some of the managers were very unprofessional and it showed. The Ramp Agents are what keep the company going though, so we represented our company well. It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend someone to work for Southwest Airlines."
good,SWA by far the best airline to work for with union pay raises and free flights wish I was around when they start going to the caribbean
good,You'll be working around aircrafts so be familiar with the training and helpful with coworkers with the daily operation.  It can be systematic. It's a flexible job with great work perks.
good,Great work environment. Fun atmosphere. Company values employees. Great benefits. Hard training. Learned time management. Great opportunity to travel the world.
good,"Working for Southwest Airlines was a great experience. The company has changed with growth, but still a great company to work for. Great benefits and flexibility."
good,it was a great company pay was little but able to work overtime to make a living . definitely had free flights and able to fly on other airlines . great
good,Southwest is one of the best jobs ive ever had and taught me so much. If you work hard you play hard.infinite opportunities for growth. It has its drawbacks but over all a great company.
good,"Fly free and other great benefits. A fun place to work and your coworkers are fun to work with as well. Great job security, but the hours sometimes are bad for the family life especially during spring break and the holidays. During this time, you're working 12 to 16 hours per day."
good,"Attendance is key. They offer great benefits for all. Training is provided along with senior agents who are always available to help. If you like helping others and are able to work under pressure, give it a try."
good,"Retiring with 10+ years of service, flight benefits for life are awesome!  We can fly as a non-revenue passenger anywhere Southwest flies.  I do know that even though I am no longer working there, the people with whom I met and/or worked are friends and family of m8ne for life!  Of all my 40+ years of work experience with more than one company, Southwest Airlines is by far the absolute best!  And we are the #1 domestic airline in the USA; the only airline in the industry which has been profitable for 48 consecutive years!  Our profit sharing for our employees is unprecedented, too!"
good,"The best airline in my opinion. Health and flight benefits, competitive salary, and strong union."
good,"Great company overall to work for. A company that cares about "
good,Fun place to work. I was wanting to be home more with family however so I had to leave and pursue a different career with another place of opportunity
good,"Enjoyed my time at SWA. The people were friendly, kind and helpful. it was a fun atmosphere. Leadership was informative supportive and fair.  They don't take themselves too seriously which makes for a great corporate culture."
good,from day one they are welcoming to everyone that comes through the door. Days are hectic sometimes just due to the nature of time constraints along with weather. Overall the co workers make it worth it
good,"If I had not gotten hurt I would still be there today. I worked in Aircraft Maintenance where there are people that are exceptional and people that require a little bit of guidance. "
good,Incredible Company with a fantastic Culture and Employees!  I loved my time there!  And the future is even brighter for what will always be MY airline!
good,"answer calls, data entry, customer service, assist passenger with the internet.  Work with amazing people!  Management is always eager to help for you succeed"
good,Great workplace culture.  We would have new Flight Attendants each week so we were able to make a lot of friends and enjoy learning new things from different Flight Attendants.
good,Highly driven company focusing on Customer above all.  It is a constantly growing company and always working towards perfection.   Often implementing new programs and tools to remain competitive
good,"Reservation/ Customer service position at Southwest Airlines is "
good,"Lots of things to look forward to for the employees, benefits very good, incentives were excellent, work hours were great after you have gained some kind of seniority."
good,"Like anything experiences vary based on ones individual experiences. Where you work, with whom you work, your working group all have an impact on your experience."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits! The culture is amazing and there are plenty of opportunities for professional growth. Especially, if you can relocate."
good,"SWA is a great company to work for, in the right station. There were issues in the station I worked in and the station MGR hid things from HDQ. Many write ups were produced and nothing was ever done about it."
good,"Great company culture with extremely positive, and upbeat people. As an intern, I was given the same responsibilities that full time employees had. The work can sometimes be slow-paced. "
good,One of the reasons that I love SWA is because they never lay off. Unfortunately my department is dissolving and I and searching for employment internal and external. But truly LOVE Southwest and don't want to leave.
good,"-Typical Day: Wait for planes to come in, load and unload, get bags to where they need to go, head home. Pretty simple stuff."
good,"Each fight required three flight attendance , I had to ensure all flights were staffed and if not, follow proper procedure to cover it"
good,I would recommend anyone who is young looking for a career to start as soon as you can. It was the best job of my life... But I never had time for family.
good,"I went into this job as a young girl with a wild spirit and yearning for something exciting in life. "
good,"A typical day was busy on the phones. If it wasn't cancellations, it was flight delays. What I learned was how to empathize. Management was okay but we had to be unionized or sometimes we may get thrown under the bus. There was great culture in the workplace. However, there were many days that were mandatory overtime and it affected plans, childcare, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job were co-workers."
good,"I spent time in several departments in during my time at Southwest Airlines.  Overall the company has a great working environment and culture.  Employees are recognized for doing good work and team work / collaboration is a way of life there.  "
good,"Great place to work, everybody is happy and polite irrespective of their rank. There is plenty to do and SWA want to surge forward with new technology and will invest the right amount of money to ensure programs are delivered risk free. Managers expect you to step up and take initiative - make things happen, work with your team and others..."
good,"A fantastic company to have worked for... had the ability to network with a multitude of various people from all cultures. The opportunity to work with a variety of platforms, tool-sets, applications and most of all... the abundant individuals and teams."
good,Southwest Airlines is an amazing company to work for and  great culture that truly cares for it s people. Great benefits including the flight benefits on southwest as well as other airlines.
good,"-Meeting and establishing a report with up to 1000 people in one day. "
good,Southwest Airlines has so much to offer.  Truly one of the best places I have had the privilege of working at.  Everyone is such a pleasure to be around.
good,"Such a fun place to work. You are able to travel if you like that, and have a great time while working. If you are a people person it is the perfect place to be!"
good,"Its kind of weird for most people to hear me say that I love working under pressure. Well it feels like its the best part of the day when I actually have a chance to challenge myself on how far my abilities can go."
good,"The job isn't to difficult, requires conditioning and awareness of your environment. Great work environment, great employees, along with all the benefits and time off you can ask for. "
good,"Culture above all !"
good,"Southwest is a great company to work for. The downfall, is seniority is everything. After 18 years with the company I still did not have weekends or holidays off. My family came second"
good,"One of the most professional, organized and fun atmosphere to be in as a software tester."
good,"I am responsible for supporting our 50,000+ employees with maintaining their travel eligibility and answering questions regarding their travel privileges.  I also negotiate agreements with our counterparts at other airlines for reciprocal leisure travel for employee travel.  I maintain the online ticketing system and troubleshoot all issues, as well as serve as community leader for over 150+ member airlines using the myIDTravel system developed by Lufthansa Systems.  I also am responsible for administering and maintaining several employee incentive/recognition programs for the company.  I compile dashboards on a routine basis for over 15 workgroups to report on recognition efforts and trends across the company."
good,Great place to work and make a career of. the benefit of flying free is awesome as well as the financial benefits. awesome perks and parties thrown by the company.
good,"I enjoyed working for SWA! Its definitely a fun loving company! Your co workers become your family. We have the tendency to spoil our passengers, however the company spoils its employees just the same. great perks company parties, company feeds the employees very often, free travel for employees, children and spouses. Overall Amazing company. best compensation of all the other airlines."
good,"great place to work, flexible schedule. you can make this career what you it. everyone is really friendly and willing to help out"

good,"Southwest knows the true meaning of work hard play hard."
good,"It's reputation is well-deserved.  Upward mobility is very slow, but overall, great people, great culture, great company."

good,I Really enjoyed working at Southwest Airlines.  I transferred from Atlanta too Boston and they made me feel right at home.
good,"I worked in the Houston Reservation Center for the last years of my Southwest Airlines career. I started in Dallas Reservations. When they closed, I went to Oklahoma City. The commuting was hard sometimes, but it was worth it to be able to stay with the company for so many years. I loved talking to the customers and helping with their travel needs. Sometimes it could be a challenge, but I didn't mind the challenge. I learned that we could usually find someway to help the customer if they had a problem or just had a question they needed answered. The hardest part of the job was when we couldn't resolve a problem. That isn't a very good feeling. It would happen sometimes, but luckily not often. Management for the most part were great. I can get a long with just about anyone. I worked with a bunch of great people, and made many great friends. The best parts of the job for me were all the wonderful benefits. Getting to fly for free is an awesome benefit. I really love Southwest Airlines."
good,Southwest airlines is a great place to work for benefits. They don't pay enough for the work that they have. They  treat there employees like machines
good,Great job benefits flight health benefits  continue today... Friendly people well trained customer Service Oriented business... Good Safety Record ... Management open to suggestions.
good,Look forward to going to work on Monday. Coworkers are always fun. Work hard play hard atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is outstation communication. Each day is different which fights redundancy. Managers encourage growth within the company.
good,"Absolutely loved working for Southwest Airlines.  Started as a ramp agent loading and off loading bags from air crafts.  Received support from management team and was awarded supervisor position with company as result of hard work.  Worked in Chicago, Dallas and Arizona.  Great health benefits, flight privileges, and family orientated atmosphere."
good,The guys like to have fun when they aren't busting their butt trying to get everything done in 30 minutes.
good,"Had a great time working there, however, that was over 20 years ago. I can't really give a review for now. My last year there was back in 1985"
good,I worked for southwest for four years and I loved it! It's a great family oriented company.
good,Southwest has an awesome company culture. They bend over backwards to go the extra mile to help customers anyway they can.
good,"A model company for all corporate jobs. The culture and the family balance was amazing. As a working mother, Swa is a great job to have. It allowed me the flexibility needed to balance both home life as well as career path."
good,Not only are the benefits amazing but the culture is what sets Southwest Airlines apart from everyone else. This is a place where you do not dread coming to work.
good,I couldn’t imagine working for a different employer ever again!  Southwest is everything people say it is and more.  It truly is a calling unlike any other company I’ve ever worked for.
good,If I could have secured weekends and Holiday off after working for 7 years with this company I would have stay the rest of my professional career life. Can’t say enough good things about Southwest. They made me the professional I am today. I just wanted to be home more and they can’t offer that because of the industry demand.
good,"I tried to get hired with Alaska Airlines for a long time before Southwest had a spot open up... they saw potential in me and made me a part of the family so quickly. The culture is great! We always have fun at work and share a lot of laughs. You get a lot of downtime when planes aren’t on the ground, but when they are- expect to work at a very fast pace to send them back out! The job can be stressful at times, but we have a blast!"
good,Lots of great people to work along side with. The job is easy but it’s hard on your body. When hired you have a probation period so don’t screw up! Listen to your trainer and be on time! Looking back my career at Southwest was a positive one.
good,Love it ... you can and will meet people from all over the world.  You cream travel the world.  You can make your own n schedule. Work adds much or less than you neef.
good,I was employed in 2002 for Inflight and successfully graduated in class 199. After 13 years of service I found myself needing more time to concentrate on my health issues. I resigned my position in 2016. Great Company that rewards their employees!
good,I have enjoyed working for Southwest Airlines and will continue to work there part time. The lifestyle on the road is very hard for me as of now and I need more routine to keep my physical and mental health top notch.
good,"It really a great place to work, you are never alone and there is always someone there to help you with whatever you need. Be very careful on the hours you pick up. The money looks good now, but it takes a toll on your body."
good,"I was let go for an error on the schedule that was my fault, and per policy I did not clear probation before the incident occurred. I would love to rejoin their team."
good,"I only worked on a project, yet I was impressed by the culture and the experience that every employee brought to the table. I would definitely recommend working there."
good,Great Company values. Training went well. They’ll fly you out to Texas. Where you’ll either complete a 1 week or 2 week training course to understand their daily order of operation.
good,"It’s a great place to work. They choose great people around the,  System and for the most part everybody work together as a team effort to get the job done working at SW."
good,"Loved everyday I worked for SWA at Bradlee Airport, Windsor Locks, CT. Its a shame I had to quit due to my wifes illness, I would have loved to still be working for them, and to this day I would work for them anytime. Tried to apply at SJU airport but they are a contracted company."
good,"Southwest was a great place to work. As an aviation buff, I loved being in a place where everyone showed my same passion for the work that we were doing. Additionally, they make a point to be inclusive and collaborative in all work. The company culture is just as amazing as everyone says it is and it was a great opportunity to start my career in aviation."
good,"The review summary is verbatim what the example summary suggested, because it's true. I actually love being at work (the commute is a whole other beast) and I do feel super productive most nights. Oh, and there is a ping-pong table."
good,Everyone that works for this company is pretty much fun and great to hang around with. Management is a bit iffy. But overall it's great I just wish I would have started here when I was in my early 20's.
good,Great place to work. Best thing Southwest Airline has to offer is the benefits. Spent 20 years throwing bags. I was very hard on the body an the heat of Arizona.
good,"The greatest blessing that ever happened to me aside from my daughter being born . From May 10 , 1988 to September 26 , 2016 . I thought I was ready for something else in my life but once you have Southwest in your blood it’s hard to get it out ! I’ve been applying and trying to get back on with this super great Company ! I will not stop trying til I get back on !"
good,"All the great things you’ve heard about SW are absolutely true. This Company invests heavily in their Employees, and it shows in the way the Company treats us. But more importantly how we as Employees treat each other"
good,"Southwest fun loving and family oriented atmosphere is something that is very hard to come by, especially with a company as big as Southwest. I would recommend 10 times out of 10 for people looking for jobs to apply for Southwest."
good,"If its your only job, it is a great place to advance quickly and the company is amazing. Loved my experience with Southwest. I hope to return someday when I can devote to it full time."
good,I totally enjoyed working there and greatly appreciated the focus on employees. There are many ways that employees are shown appreciation in pay and activities for the benefit of employees.
good,My work experienced with SWA was more than life experiences it was more of a family feelings when you get to work and they care more than you realize.
good,The days can be both fun and crazy at the same time. But management is always there to help out and the coworkers are great. the hardest part of the job is the heat.
good,"I love working for southwest, it has become like my home away from home. the hardest part is balancing home and work but you make it work. I love the people I work with, they are truly the reason I go to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Southwest, but it wasn't what I felt a calling for so once I was able to move on to what I really wanted to do, I made the change."
good,"best place to work. pay progression, once reach 11 years your at top pay. currently our contract is $30.53 an hour., definitely have ability to pick up hours from our co-hearts."
good,Great Company to work for they put their Employees first . SWA works hard and then they play hard.  Great employee stock/401K benefits. Great culture through out the year.  Keeps everyone motivated to work harder.
good,"amazing people great place to work. friendly, kind, plenty of work. dedicated to helping others in need. polite sweet family friendly. would love to work there again."
good,The company is absolutely great about taking care of its Employees. The senior leadership is extremely open and willing to coach and mentor even front line folks.
good,"Everyone is outgoing and helpful. "
good,everyday was something new and exciting. You can work as much as you want due to the railroad act. You can also buddy bid which means you work 2 doubles and a single and you are done for the week. From the first day of hire you-your partner- your mom and dad- and your children all get to fly anywhere anytime for free. This was the best job I had ever had. The airport life is something everyone should try .
good,Southwest is overall a GREAT company to work for. I would strongly encourage anyone interested to keep applying. It is worth the wait. We have a lot of people to apply but because of the wait they loose interest.
good,"Southwest is an awesome company to work for, it was unfortunate that i got injured and had to resign my position, if i could do it all over I would. Great benefits etc."
good,"Very stable. Challenging but worth it. You will quickly learn many things in regards to aviation and customer service. Everyone I worked with, from customer service agents to flight attendants and pilots down to the most junior ramp agent were friendly and helpful. Excellent benefits...health insurance, dental, vision, etc....A great place to make a career not just a job. Excellent balance of fun and professional atmosphere."
good,They really take care of their employees and most of all workers are great to work with. Loved working here for over 12 years as a flight attendant. Great benefits and pretty much make your own schedule.
good,"Working at Southwest Airlines is nothing short of amazing. The pay is well within industry standards and the culture is the best bar non. The managers are supportive and look forward to celebrating all milestones in your life while giving you the opportunity to grow and advance within the company. Sometimes I think that working at Southwest is a cheat code to life. The hardest part of my job would probably be the fact that sometimes I have to travel a lot but the pros definitely out weight the cons. I could not seeing myself leaving Southwest for anything and this comes from someone who always has recruiters from other companies in my LinkedIn inbox. "
good,SWA prides itself in caring for it's employees. They have always cultivated an inclusive environment with a unique work/life balance. A fun company and culture.
good,"Overall SWA is a wonderful and challenging company,  filled with managers that both care about employees but also strive for excellence in results delivery. Work hard play hard is definitely the motto that drives the company"
good,Very fun environment but at times the workload can be pretty hard especially during holidays and summer. Great place to work. Lots of opportunity to move throughout the company.
good,"Southwest Airlines is a company that truly cares about its employees.  While at Southwest Airlines, I learned that it is possible to have fun while you work.  You do have to work hard but at least you will feel valued for the contributions you make. The overall benefits are outstanding and it's nice to have pass privileges, too."
good,Great place to work and the management with this company is above the rest in the industry.  A place to make life long lasting relationships with people.
good,It’s a fun environment to work in and free travel and flexible time and hours to work. We have great medical benefits and 401k savings plan that matches dollar per dollar
good,"It was welcoming and felt like we all belonged to a great cause. e were sent to Dallas for group training to review the culture of the company. Great benifits, great buisness model."
good,"Southwest really is that fun. I’ve never met a better class of people than my coworkers. The challenge is to keep the innovative, scrappy attitude that’s produced decades of success in a ruthless industry."
good,Love the job and company. Too far from home and drive is getting challenging. Great job opportunities. Room for advancement. Medical 401 k life insurance bonuses.
good,"Great leadership"
good,"Great company, relaxed working environment, excellent benefits. I feel like there are unlimited chances for advancement. I enjoy the people I work with."
good,Excellent workplace.  Enjoyed each customer and returning passenger. I enjoyed talking and making accommodations to every passenger depending on their needs.
good,"Great Job in the Union.  Everything is based off seniority, so start young. Work unlimited overtime to boost income.  Lots of time off if desired and shift trading."
good,"Great place to work.  Advancement opportunities are there, but are even harder to get then even getting hired on in the first place. The benefits are awesome.  100% 401k match up to 9.2% of your contributions, and then there is profit sharing on top of that."
good,"After 13 years as a Flight Attendant, I was able to work as much or as little as I wanted due to my seniority and being able to give away or trade my trips. The company's philosophy is if you treat your employees right, they will treat your customers right. The corporate culture is ideal."
good,I stay very busy taking care of the Customers.I have learned all different aspects of the airline industry. .Managers are good.The culture is very good.The hardest part of the job is during irregular operations.The most enjoyable about my job is seeing the smiles in our employees and our customers.

good,Love the company and enjoyed all the travel benefits and company spirit.Great workplace culture and love how southwest gives back to the community and participates in several benefits. The company is wonderful and wish I still worked there but needed a better paying job
good,Great place to work with friendly coworkers and a work environment that is conducive to production. The company culture cannot be beat by anyone else.
good,"Contractors get excluded from a lot. But definitely one of the best places I've ever worked. Office is huge, and the contractors do occasionally get converted to full time."
good,I've had the pleasure of interning within Southwest's TechOps department as an engineer. I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience I've gained through real world and hands on engineering projects. I would recommend Southwest for any engineer seeking internship or full time career.
good,"What an amazing experience it has been working for Southwest...  The training is vigorous, but definitely prepares you for any and all emergencies you may encounter."
good,"The pay is good, benefits are a plus, job can be stressful at times but co workers make it fun! I got a raise within 3 months of working foe the company"
good,"Great Learning Experience. Insights to the most critical aspect of the Aviation industry - Fuel Supply chain Management, which includes tracking the fuel movement, fuel inventory and processing settlements."
good,Southwest airlines rocks! its a great place to work. I was an intern there and really enjoy the flight benefits. Everyone there is very nice and a pleasure to work with
good,"SouthWest Airlines is an ecellencent company to work for."
good,ThIs job helped me be more outgoing and talkative to customers. Really helped boost my confidence as far as customer service goes. And also taught me to work on my own.
good,"A fun loving Company to work for!  Great Benefits with a lot of awesome perks! My days at SWA are very busy and usually always ""fly"" by!  Great employees and got to LUV that Southwest Airline culture!"
good,Very physical job downloading and uploading luggage but a great place to work.  Management is very good at helping new employees succeed by giving constant feedback.
good,"representative who consistently meets and exceeds productivity goals. Proven capacity to troubleshoot issues to resolve issues quickly. Maintains a high level of professionalism, patience and efficiency to minimize customer dissatisfaction and increase customer loyalty."
good,Southwest was and probably always will be a wonderful company to work for.  I have been trying to get back into the airlines and its is very difficult process.
good,This is by far the best place I have ever worked. The culture is amazing and the people are great. They truly care about their employees. Lots of opportunity to grow.
good,Southwest Airlines welcomed me with open arms and gave me the biggest opportunity to see how amazing a huge corporate can take such great care of its employees.
good,"I like my team members and my manager. They are friendly, supportive, knowledge sharing, and help you to learn new things."
good,"My day could be fun. Other days could be very stressful. Issues that made my day very trying were bad weather, mechanical problems, air traffic control problems, passenger problems on inbound a/c, passenger problems on ground,etc. On the plus side when these issues arose I could always count on my co-workers from the various work groups to step up."
good,I loved working for Southwest Airlines.  Those were the best 18 years of my life.  I loved the people I worked with and the fun activities we did at work. Sometimes the work hours were long but we got compensated very well.  I left at a time when my mother passed away and I could not cope at the time.
good,"you have the freedom to transfer to other cities, free travel, great company, benefits and company culture, can be fast paced, must like the public and must have an outgoing personality, also have to be ready to jump into any situation that may present itself"
good,"I came to SWA with aircraft 6 and retired 30 years later at age 60 with 535 A/C. I chose to come back to work at SWA after 6 years of play. "
good,"Great work culture. A cooperative team. Good Travel perks. Ability to grow."
good,"Southwest Airlines is a wonderful company to work for. They care about everyone from the CEO to the wheelchair pushers. They were very involved with the community. I was fortunate enough to get to be a part of things such as the Ronald McDonald House, Kidd's Kids, Habitat for Humanity etc. I learned so much about Customer Service and how to keep them happy and coming back. Managers are great about mentoring and encouraging employees to promote within the Company. There was so much opportunity to be able to promote or learn about different jobs. I held so many hats while I was there and it was such a valuable experience for business and personal life. I do miss Southwest so much, but I needed to leave to be able to be with my family more often. My husband is military and between training and deployments I felt like it was important for me to be home on the weekends and nights with our children, that was not possible while working with Southwest. Shift work was the hardest part of the job."
good,Casual work place is great! People are willing to take time out of their day to teach me internal processes or answer any questions I have. There is a lot of potential to get on board with different projects if you take the initiative and are willing to learn something new. Co-workers are very experienced and good at what they do. My management is pretty laid back and I can make it to any appointments or arranged plans with given notice.
good,"this was a great environment for work.  it was a true team spirit of the airlines that is southwest airlines.  "
good,"Southwest Airlines provides Customer Service with warmth, friendliness, and a desire to assist customers and fellow employees as well.  The satisfaction received from helping others is the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,"Southwest Airlines has a company built on a foundation of Customer Service and core values such as a Warrior Spirit, Fun Luving Attitude and a Servants Heart. Working at Southwest Airlines days were often very long and flexibility was a must, however I was hired to just be myself and make sure that I worked as a team to accomplish a positive customer experience both internally and externally while having fun. My favorite part of the job was being able to walk into a mess and make it right for the customers and employees. My least favorite part of the job was the particular positions that I held were operational so I was unable to attend the culture events that a 9am- 5pm employee had the benefit of attending, however  Southwest made it possible for their employees to send  a little bit of the LUV even in the Operational positions through the company culture committee."
good,"One of the best companies to work for, Company culture based on Golden Rule. Great workplace with great benefits! Work Hard, Play Hard, Treat everyone like family, in short, Take care of your employees and your employees will take care of you!"
good,"Absolutely love working for this company, everyone you see is friendly and kind. Great atmosphere and its always something fun happening at work. The company makes sure that the employees are happy doing their job. Love the motto "" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". Great company to work for"
good,the best job i had in my life so far it is alot to be done and a team ready and willing to get it done. a typical day come in eat my lunch clock in find my gate or tug if i was a bag runner be at your flight 10  mins before flight 7-8 flights a day
good,"My co-workers were great...we all worked hard.  The pay started out low but as time passed it turned into a great paying job.  The benefits were excellent; the best I have ever had.  The job was not a physical one...more mental and not getting much exercise was the only draw back for me.  You could always pick up extra shifts or give yours away which made things flexible.  The hardest part of the job was basically doing the same thing all day by just taking reservations; however, I became a Customer Care Representative and that changed things up quite a bit!!!"
good,"hardest part of the job is probably working with the co-workers  If you're not a ""people"" person then it would be hard to work as a team on a flight."
good,"•	Manage the Director's calendar and scheduling"
good,"Working in the Tax Department at Southwest Airlines is a learning eveperience everyday., There is so much that goes in the fuel aspect of the business that I never knew before. Learning the different rules and pipeline regulations was a learning cure for me, but with patience and hard work I now fully understand how what i do is not only important to the Tax Department but how it effects the bottom line for SWA as well."
good,"I arrived to work thirty minutes early, I attended briefings before the start of the day."
good,"It was a great Company to work for at the time. Really in enjoyed the culture, the great parties and incentives they offered. The hardest part was having young kids at that time and when we where mandatory to work it was difficult at the last minute to find child care. It was a great fun filled atmosphere with a lot of growth and variety."
good,"Good pay."
good,"Southwest is a wonderful company to work for, the management is supportive and always available to listen to concerns.  I loved my colleges and the fun, happy working environment.  It truly is a great company to work for."
good,My first job in the travel industry. Learned to book reservations and provide excellent customer service. Love the culture of the company! Learned a lot of lessons on work ethic that carried me through my other jobs.
good,Great Company. Terrific co-workers. Everyone is truly happy to be there. No threat of layoffs. My department was micro-managed which makes you feel like a child.
good,"one of the best fortune five hundred companies to work for. I learned how to be nice to customers, and how to be well groomed. The hardest part of the job is when the customer would miss there scheduled flight. Just being part of a well put together managed team."
good,"great company to work for , great job, great benefits, and great life-style just everything about this job and company is awesome "
good,"I learned hazmat, fire traing, deicing. I had all kinds of experience working for Southwest...Such as broken equioment, bag belts, airplanes, weather conditions & learn how to adjust to all & finish the job at task on time & safely."
good,Management were very friendly and nice to you. Co-workers there were super nice and helpful.
good,"Shift work, always something going on. I learned a ton about customer service and how to handle difficult customer situations. Management was good most of the time. Co-workers were amazing, still friends with all of them. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with delayed flights due to inclement weather and upset customers. Loved meeting new people, boarding the flights, chatting with friendly customers, learning new job duties, interacting with co-workers, and the great teamwork always displayed by everyone in the company."
good,Analyze current business and consistently implement changes that drive revenue
good,"Working with new crew members and meeting so many people in one day of work was so exciting, everyday there were new challenges. Southwest really supports having fun while doing your job well. I enjoyed the interaction with both males and females and even the occational reroute to another city than we were supposed to end up at. I had a child and got married while having this job and being away was too much of a strain on my personal life so I had to quit."
good,"15 years with SWA, co-workers were great to work with and we are still friends after my taking the buyout in 2009. The consolidating of gate for one agent to work became over bearing some days, especially when there were as many as 5-6 flights for one agent to work and some overselling seats. The company, however, had a great culture and i learned to communicate better working at an airline and had a great working relationship with valued frequent flyers and valued new customers"
good,"I worked as a Flight Attendent for almost 8 yrs. I wish I had never quit. I loved the people I worked with on the plane an managers. I learned Customer Service, First Aide and so much about myself and life."
good,There are many parts of the wheel at Southwest Airlines. In Reservations be prepaired to be tethered to a headset for the durations of your scheduled time. Breaks and lunches are scheduled and adhering to the schedule is expected as in any Call Center. Your co-workers are the saving grace at any call center. Hardest part of the job is being sedentary. The most enjoyable part is the ability to make a positive difference on each call. Calls have a variety of requests or concerns and that makes each one unique.
good,Typical airline pilot schedule.  Trips usually three or four days in length. Monthly bid on schedule working 16 to 19 days a month.  Retired Sep 2019 age 65.
good,I retired from southwest and then joined SECU a credit union Part time  I’m ready for reinventing my self. I am a very professional customer service person. I’ve excelled in all my position and my concierge training make me a excellent person for any customer service position.
good,"Southwest Airlines is an amazing company to work for. The people are genuinely kind and full of Southwest spirit. The company takes care of its people with outstanding benefits, work life balance, and luving culture."
good,Southwest should pay more to their employees where cost of living is higher. Southern California is where I live but we only make 13.70 at the location I work. While lax is paid 15.00 an hour. Which doesn't make sense to any of us. It causes most of us to get other jobs to pay to live here.
good,"I loved working for southwest airlines, it has a very inclusive family vibe and they treat their employees really well.  The work it's very fast paced.  I think the only downside it's the mandatory overtime"
good,It was great. I secured the main lobby at Lovefield Airport- - Southwest Airlines Headquarters. I made badges for anyone coming...temporary badges for employees.
good,good fun place to work they really take care of their employees. they make it really comfortable for new employees to learn about the airline industry
good,"I would recommend Southwest Airlines to anyone who is a go-getter, and likes to travel and advance within the company. Someone is always available to assist you when needed.  Your opinion counts."
good,"Awesome culture, amazing work perks, supportive management. Hardest part of the job is maintaining a work/life balance and not taking customer complaints personally."
good,"Interning at Southwest was an incredible experience - the teams are excited for you to be there and want to help you to learn and grow as much as possible, free standby flight benefits make for great adventures, and you get to meet the best new friends!"
good,"My experience up to this point with Southwest Airlines has been a good one.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement, and Southwest really does care about their employees in making sure they succeed in whatever they choose to do within the company.  It’s a fun Luv-ing atmosphere where they try to incorporate fun into the job, and that makes doing the job much easier."
good,"Great work environment just drink the koolaid "
good,"Once you are in! You are in!! Great place to work. The moment I got the call I almost cried! I know you will too! I tried to work for Southwest for 2 years straight. Took me eight try's. If you feel like giving up, Don't!"
good,"SWA is a family more than an airline. My 23 years with Southwest went by too fast. Once in, I never wanted to leave. With strong family support, one can still manage a flight attendant schedule. For me, I took retirement when it became available only because my children were small and my husband and I both worked crazy hours. Heartbroken, I had to give up my SWA family for my new, personal family."
good,"I enjoy being a ramp agent at southwest airlines LAX station. The job is constantly busy with some downtime. The hours are there if you need them and after spending a couple of years on the job, your pay gets better."
good,Love my job could be better pay  especially in high Cost of living areas like New York and Los Angeles. Benefits Could be Better also Culture is good for the most part!
good,Very productive and fun place to work.  I absolutely enjoyed serving the customers.  Management is friendly and fair.  The culture is exciting and fun.  Celebrations take place very often. Great place to work!
good,"Best company I ever worked for! They always put the employees first! You work hard, are rewarded well and when time permits they know and encourage you to have fun!"
good,When Herb kelleher and Rollin King founded SW Airlines they truly broke the mode.  They were two phenomenal men who truly cared about their employees.
good,"Southwest is the company you want to retire at . Working the ramp , in the 4th into the 5th year your making pretty good money. With how much they match on 401K."
good,"Southwest had wonderful workplace culture. My main criticism "
good,"Really great place to work. The company is really focused on taking care of it's employees. They will invest in you and most people that work there, make it their last job or they always come back. I plan on doing so"
good,Southwest airlines taught me the difference between having a job and having a great career. Not only was it a fun filled job but the benefits such as health insurance and free flights  were great.
good,"Never have I worked someplace where ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" ethics are more accurate.  Loved working for this amazing company and sad that I messed it all up but I will remain loyal to SWA as they are amazing people and are legit real and live the SWA way."
good,Very busy and helping a lot of people. Constant answering questions and problem solving. At counter constant lifting bags up to 50 lbs and ocasionally 75 lbs.
good,Very good company. It has many opportunities to excel.. Train very well.. Very fast paced at times.. Benefits are great.. Medical is the best.. Travel benefits are great..
good,I would have never have left had it been for the schedule just didn't end up working for my family. I would like to go back during a different season and my kids are a little older.
good,"It is a great company to work for if you can get in, plenty of chances to move up or changes jobs. If you want you can do temp stations and go help other stations. The work is demanding and physical (depending of job) but knowing you did your best and passengers a happy is its reward."
good,"Southwest is an outstanding company to work for with so many benefits. Honestly, the best. Station management can be difficult however the benefits of the company outweigh the struggle with station management. Training is top-notch and growth is plentiful. The overall culture is warm and abundant - internally and externally."
good,Incredible company culture and headquarters. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Was able to meet the CEO while I was an intern there and he was so nice and humble.

good,"Southwest Airlines is a great place to work. The people and culture are the reason why I have enjoyed my time at Southwest. The management treats you like family along with some of the executives I have met. They encourage building up their Employees with SWAU the on-site ""unviersity"" and working with Employees to find their ""dream job"" inside the company.A fun place to work with great culture and events including deck parties almost every Monday where they provide food, drinks, and prizes for Employees that show up."
good,"Let’s get this straight the day I leave Southwest is in a body bag. I work ramp right. Ok but this job is a career, and it offers movement of all types whether it’s up the chain or laterally in another department. If you put on your work you will get what you want. Ramp is union with pay scale online."
good,Southwest is a great place to work! The flexibility of my schedule is most important. Management listens. Hardest part of my job is being away from home. Co-hearts (co-workers) are great.
good,"You'll never be judged, best company to work for! On a typical day you deal with a lot of customers and a lot of face to face interaction. With all kinds of work groups, pilots, flight attendants, ramp, ATC and more.."
good,"I loved my job as an Operations Agent. It's definitely a lot of work and everything there revolves around time. Must be quick to respond to issues with customers or really anything. Every day was something new. The challenge to get flights out on time/early was something I thought as fun. Seniority isn't the best when you're first hired, it will certainly take time to move up.  I would recommend working here. It's not like any other job. You can work as much as you want, even when hired as part-time. Picking up hours is easy! Just as giving up hours if you need to or want to."
good,Great place to work.  Very friendly employee company.  THey strive to bring out the best in each employee.  They get the idea that great employees make the company strong so they try to look after each one!  excellent chances for advancment if employee wants to strive for that.  Benefits were outstanding.  Flying for free was also a huge plus!
good,LUV it here! The people of SWA are like family. This job keeps me on my toes and challenges me in a positive way. Literally the best place to work! I never want to leave!

good,"I love working here. My managers are great and help me develop and grow. The work life balance is awesome. Even as an intern, the work I am doing is important and contributing to the company and my personal growth. They truly want to make sure that I take a ton of experience away from the internship."
good,"Southwest Airlines is one of the few places I've worked where they actually showed that they care about their employees. Most other places just like saying it, but rarely do it in practice. "
good,"I will be eternally grateful for the skills,culture,acknowledgment ,training and culture this wonderful company provided me.

good,"Muy Bueno"
good,"Multi-Tasker Extraordinaire!  If you weren't when you were hired, you became that way.  The airline business can change in a blink of the eye and you need to be ready and flexible.  No two days were alike.  We worked hard and played hard.  The rewards are too many to count.  We were allowed to be creative in our job, always doing what we could to work smarter not harder.  Culture was off the charts, the office I worked in was rewarded a Trophy for the Best Culture within the entire Company in 2015.  I personally served on the Culture Committee for 25 out of the 27 years I was employed.  The most enjoyable part of my job were the people.  No two alike, so everyday was a different day!  If I didn't truly love people, then I would not have lasted.  Internal and External Customers were what made my day."
good,"Management easy to work with, all the way up to CEO."
good,"Southwest was my first job; hired at 20 years old and retired many years later. From day 1, and every following day, I never regretted my career path. Had the opportunity to be a part of the Las Vegas station growing from 30 flights to 250+. Had the opportunity to experience a culture crafted by Herb and Colleen. Worked as a Ramp and Operations Agent, Operations and Provisioning Supervisor, and Manager of Ramp and Operatons. Had the opportunity to move around the country and experience life in different states/cities. Career advancement is only limited to your goals. My managers were predominently effective, engaging, and truely wanted the best for every employee. I would not hesitate to recommend Southwest as an employer. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to grow up at Southwest."
good,Interning at Southwest was an amazing experience. You are empowered to develop your skills and put your best foot forward in important tasks. As an intern I was given meaningful assignments that actually made a difference. You are encouraged to network and build a Southwest family throughout your time here. There are numerous development and growth opportunities through participating in days in the field or coffee chats with individuals from different departments. As an intern you can also partake in the benefit of flying free on standby to any U.S locations that Southwest serves as well as a reduced fee for international travel!

They make you feel more like a family, even if you are no longer employed with them you still have cohearts keeping in contact.Everyone has a smile, very professional and polite and a fun luving spirit  from start to finish. besides the airline benefits the compensation is pleasant, and growth within the company."

I love the way we make sure customer comes first and satisfying them in all aspects."

I meet with the TSA to discuss staffing requirements.  I ensure that all supervisors and employees are present. I monitor the work activity throughout the day, ensuring that safety, security and customer service polices are adhered to. We aim to deliver the highest quality customer service at the lowest possible expense, staying well within company budget guidelines. My fellow Managers and I collectively oversee and mange the various  work  areas within BWI. The most difficult (but very common!) part of my job is dealing with the unexpected,  i.e. cancelled flights, weather delays, maintenance issues.  The rewarding part of my job is turning a service failure into a service success!"
good,Southwest Airline is a great and innovative internal customer service organization that is constantly growing and giving career opprotunities
good,"Wonderful management, awesome co-workers, and excellent benefits. Great place to work if you can stick it out through the first year or so, while you gain seniority and deal with mandatory overtime. Company encourages individuality, and there are many options for advancement. If you want to go to Inflight, it's encouraged to go internally, as interviews occur more often."

good,"A typical day at work is friendly energized coworkers and other staff greeting you with a smile and laughs. Answer customers inquiries over the phone on their Rapid Reward accounts try to resolve them the best of my ability. This is a full-time position the hardest part is not being able to please every customer with conditions of policies and procedures that we have in place. The most enjoyable part is assisting them, making them happy, being able to get them to their destinations and hearing people from different cultural backgrounds."
good,I love working at Southwest Airlines.  Dealing with customers(passengers) and fellow workers was something I will cherish.  Helping customers get on the aircraft and sending them to their destinations was a joy.  At times the passengers were upset because of delays but I tried to make it as pleasant as possible.  I love to deal with different people as I enjoy people.
good,"A typical day of work can be found in my resume. What I learned was how to unload and prepare aircrafts to and from their respective terminal and gates. Management was more than compassionate, always lending a hand when needed. Co-workers super friendly and down to earth. Hardest part of the job is getting there. Had to park three miles away, take a bus, walk half a mile just to clock in. Most enjoyable parts where bringing the planes in and pushing the out."

I work with the best coworkers in the world, and I have grown a lot under each of the leaders I have had in my two years time. I would say that the most difficult thing about the job is staying flexible and positive when I am required to use my secondary skillset.  But the best part of the job is definitely the people I share my work experience with. They have brightened many a dark day and brought out the best in me. I am thankful for Southwest's culture and people."

good,"Southwest is an awesome company to work for! I did a 3 month internship for them and had an amazing time learning what they do and helping in real projects. It's common to walk down the halls and see higher-ups in t-shirts and flip flops. The atmosphere is very relaxed but their expectations of your work are very high. No other company can compare when it comes to taking care of the employees as much as they do their customers! Although, I interned, I am an adult with many years of work experience so I have plenty of points-of-comparison when it comes to other companies, and Southwest is definitely at the top of my list as being the best."

good,Southwest Airlines is a great company to work for.  The career opportunities are endless.  A typical schedule for a Ramp Agent is 8.5 hours.  The best part of this type of job is that you don't see the same thing day in and day out like you work working on an assembly line.  The hardest part of this job is adjusting to working in the adverse weather conditions.
good,"I have worked for Southwest Airlines for over 25 years and they are a  a great company to work for I worked for and it was the best job I have ever had in my career. I learned valuable information about the airline business that I could use in any customer service job.

good,its the best company to work for as an intern. you can do and learn a lot of hands on stuff from the internship which prepares you for real time job situations
good,"This was the most fun I ever had while earning income.  I only flew for a couple of years because I had to relocate for school, but I cried like a baby when I told my supervisor I had to quit.  I miss this terribly, but now with a young family, it would be very difficult to work out the logistics of flying, commuting, and being there for my family."
good,You can either have fun or you can complain.  It's up to you how you want your workday to go.  The culture is what you make it.  Some days are more busy than others.  What you always have to do is make sure you are safe and take care of yourself first.  It can be very dangerous on the ramp and when you become to comfortable that is when tragedy will strike.  You have to stay alert to stay alive in that environment.  Just remember it is not worth your life to take a short cut and you will do just fine.

I learned that this job can be stressful at times but also has this nice warm sense of relief in the air for me. Didn't really know much about the managers but i know they do their job accordingly. To me the hardest part of the job was doing my bid correctly because you never know what you're going to get so you have to pay close attention to what you bid for. The most enjoyable part of it all was just overall being part of an amazing company who puts their customers first and shows friendliness and great company spirit and for that i will be forever greatful.

good,My most enjoyable part was being able to travel and i enjoyed learning to process payroll alone with their initiative passes for the company each quarterly.  I loved how they took care of their employees.
good,"I used to have 2 jobs to make money now im only working for SWA, even entry level pays good! (2 raises per year) top out is like $32 per hour, flexibility(shift trades, giveaway shifts are just awesome), all the benefits in the world plus travel benefits, OTs, mandatory overtimes(double pay)... i will retire from this company"

good,"Working as a Ramp/Provisioning Agent at Southwest Airlines was hard work but the opportunities, if pursued, are rewarding.  The Ground Operations at Southwest Airlines ran smoothly on a daily basis because of the seniority in the department.  It was a tough job on your body but it paid well if you were loyal and determined."
good,"SWA is an amazing company with great benefits and even better associates. Although I was only there for a short amount of time, due to me being an intern, it has been a phenominal experience to work with them"
good,I always enjoyed my work experience at swa its a fun place to work the working location was not that great for me on contract row somewhat old school for me
good,"SWA is an employee owned company that is fun loving and caring. I loved going to work with my friends. We had the best passengers and managers. As a flight attendant we spent may hours taking care of our passengers not only on the air craft but also on the ground when we had delays due to weather or anything out of the ordinary. As an employee owned company it was our job to treat every passenger like family and we did that with an open fun loving attitude.

good,I worked with a small team of 5 people.  We managed the hiring of flight attendants and built the schedules they would bid and fly on.  I learned how to be a team player sharing and testing ideas to make the flight schedule more productive and efficient.  The culture is laid back we did not have to wear slacks or suits.  Jeans and collared shirts or appropriate t-shirts were fine.  The hardest part of the job was having to work weekends and deal with problems that would arise in the program that runs the schedule.  This was something we were constantly working on.  The most enjoyable part was my team.  We had each others back and would work to make each other better.

good,Southwest  airlines is great company to work with. Great Culture and great management. I had great fun working with Southwest airlines.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to locate a passengers' bag/bags', I enjoy feeling the smile coming from the customer through the phone and the joy of solving the problem. A typical day at work for me would be; taking up to 50 calls a day, and making at least 10-20 customers' smile feeling appreciated for being a customer."
good,Great Company to work for. I was a very happy employee.   I worked for Southwest for over 14 years.  I hope to find another company to work for that was as great as this.
good,Not before or since have I worked with a company that sincerely cares for its employees - top to bottom.  Truly one of the few companies that understand that the survival of a company is mostly based on the care the frontline employees receive their leaders.
good,Working with a lot f people.How to take care of problems got along with everyone. Leaving my family for so long time. All have something to do
good,Southwest was a fun place to work for not only the people you work with are great but a lot of the customers as well.  The perks of traveling for discounted rates didn't hurt either.

good,"I enjoy working for SWA with my lovely CO-hearts!"
good,Very exciting place to work.  A company that takes pride in its costumers as well as the employees. Typical day getting to work with the 737 and 800 planes.
good,if your looking for a fun place to work this is the job for you. I have regretted leaving southwest airlines since I left. It was to far from my place a residents and in Indiana where there were no jobs at all I had to take it being more then an hour away from home.
good,"Great place to work, they have a good culture and a good environment to learn and grow.  I enjoyed my time and experience with great coworkers and great leadership."
good,"Very friendly culture, very flexible work hours. People friendly environment with really good supervisors and managers. Family atmosphere and professional. As a provisioning agent the hardest thing for me was pulling the provisioning truck up to the planes for provisioning."
good,Productive and fun workplace. I enjoyed the experience with great coworkers and great management. I learned and grew a lot as an individual while working for this fine company.
good,"Working for Southwest Airlines for 30 years was a very enjoyable experience. As a Flight Attendant you have to be courteous, polite, and flexible. If and when you have a medical emergency or emergency landing, you have to keep yourself together. I had my fair share of emergencies and you have to remain calm, going through your emergency procedures, as well as briefing the passengers on what the situation is. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with hundreds of different people in a day. Your constantly walking up and down the aisle checking on passengers. You also have the duty of taking care of the flight crew (pilots). It's very hard work, but rewarding. The best part of flying was over-nighting in different cities and sightseeing if it wasn't snowing, raining, or the weather had changed. Working with my co-workers was also a bonus."
good,"Keeping fully informed on information for our passengers.  rescheduling and accommodating passengers."

good,Amazing company that valued their employees and their customers as well.  Traveled the world for free.
good,"I worked for Southwest Airlines in NY as a Ramp Agent for almost 12 years before being terminated 2 years ago because of my attendance.  There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret letting my personal issues get in the way of my job.  I let myself down but more importantly let this great company down.  Wish I could go back and start with them again now that everything is back to normal for me but understandably they probably do not want to give me a second chance.  The culture there is fantastic, people are even better and it is an outstanding company to work for if you can get your foot in the door.  You can make as much money as your willing to work for being that there's always an abundance of overtime and double time.  Benefits are fantastic as well as the unlimited free travel benefits for you, your parents, spouse or committed partner and Children up to age 23 I believe.  My last 2 years there I made $90,000 each year with all the overtime I worked as a baggage handler.  If I hadn't screwed it up I would have been enjoying my 14th year there but I did so I live with it.   If I can get back in and start all over again someday I will in a heartbeat!   Bottom line this is a career you can have and be proud of if you can get in from beginning to end!"

good,"Every day was a different at SWA. When you checked in for your 3-4 day, you may never know who you are going to work with and will you get along. The great part about the SWA couture is that we all did. Southwest backed us on situations where if the customer made a complaint, they would hear both sides, before automatically handling the situation. I Loved waking up in new cities, going out and exploring and just grabbing every moment out of life that i could!"

good,"Funny, there is not a 'typical' day with the airline industry! Every day has weather, operational or security issues on both sides of the country that will effect the ontime performance. Flexibility becomes your middle name! Fortunately, my co-workers are truly the heart of Southwest! As a supervisor, we were able to assist, rebook and find accomdations when the challenges hit the fan all the while wearing smiles and extending sincere compassion. Southwest Airlines culture is lengendary throughout the industry! Pot lucks, dress up days, employee birthday recognitions are monthly events! Southwest provides great opportunities with the other departments for all employees. Truly the most enjoyable part of the job for me, was the interaction with the Passengers! All Passengers have a travel story - happy or sad! I am honored to have been part of their lives, if only for a brief time."

good,"I love Southwest Airlines when you work for them you have a family you work hard, you start early and it is very demanding, they tolerate nothing. But it makes you realize that its a good thing. The training was fantastic, They make you learn and its fun, and if you love to travel its a great job, I never look at the pay check, If you work your passion you will never feel like you are working, The hardest part of the job is putting up with people that are impatient, or drunk, the most enjoyable are people traveling with pets, they are so cute, or just married couples, or just happy people on vacaton I love people anyway you learn so much from them."

good,"Working for Southwest Airlines was a dream come true."
good,"Not only fly freedom but also work freedom!!!"
good,"There were never 2 days the same and I absolutely loved the opportunity to work for Southwest Airlines! I have always enjoyed being at the airport, any airport since I was about 5 years old. I remember telling my Father that I wanted a job washing the airplanes!! Some of my daily duties would include checking in and assisting passengers onboard their flights if needed. I also would book trips and sell tickets for future travel. Southwest Airlines has a very ""open"" policy when it comes to any suggestions from employees that can make Southwest better. I left with about 13 yrs. and sometimes really miss the ""SWA family"" as I got along and had a lot of fun times with both Management and peers.  The hardest part of the job was probably having delays and on occasion, cancellations....not a very happy time for passengers and I felt so bad when it would interfere with families vacations or special occasions. I will always miss Southwest Airlines and have many good friends to this day from the few cities I worked at and I believe that is the hardest part of working at Southwest Airlines....the people!"
good,I had to commute to Chicago that was my base. I would work or be gone for 6 to 7 days at a time sometimes longer. I worked with 2 other flight attendants and two pilots. having fun serving drinks and peanuts and some light snacks to our passengers.I have been all over the United States. I was sad to leave the company they truly were a blessing to work for. I only left after i found my true love and settled down with two young babies.Needless to say I had a hard time as a mom to have to leave them for such long periods of time.
good,"SWA had the best benifits of any company I have worked for. And the training was fun and informative. Just wish the union workers of Arkansas would have listened when asked to stop abusing the absentee system. When the time came to down size, the centers with the worst attendance got closed, and Arkansas had the worse attendance record of any center. Closed and jobs offered to those that would move and had performed as asked."

Process payroll reports for legal department.  Our department is small and we worked great as a team being there for one another when needed.

good,I loved working here. Being hired without an education or a clue to what needed to be done this was an awesome place to work. Sadly enough the office closed down. But Im left with fond memories.

The most enjoyable was working with great people.

I had previously worked for the company when the 1st call center was opened in Little Rock Ar & transferred to Oklahoma for a year when that center closed.

Then there were days when the weather could cause your whole day to go towards a downward domino effect. I enjoyed working for the company, It was truly a family and management cares about their employees. There was not a birthday that went by when I did not receive a birthday card from corporate, and when I did retire I was blown away at the gifts I received. Great company benefits, co-workers work together at work and remain good friends outside of work. I miss you Southwest Airlines."
good,"I had the privileged to work for SOUTHWEST AIRLINES for 14 years before retiring. One will be hard pressed in finding another company like SOUTHWEST that cares and takes a personal interest in each and every employee. Companies around the globe aspire to operate in the ways Southwest Airlines has in regards to its people and its culture but find it difficult, enjoying little to no success in discovering the mystical cohesive forces that build a company strong from the ground up, this is what SOUTHWEST has mastered. The secret is in its people and its people are SOUTHWEST!!! If you want to be a part of a team, grow in ways unimaginable and be a part of something that's real, this is where you go. It simply doesn't get much better than this!"
good,"This place is harder to get into than Harvard, statistically speaking. Whenever they have openings, they are open only for a short amount of time. If you are just looking for a job, have a bad attitude and are generally lazy, move along you won't get hired because it is very competitive. The company culture is great, it is just like family when you go to work. The co-workers are great and so is management."
good,Outstanding company! Great Management with a heart! Open to your ideas and suggestions.
good,"typicial day:arrive early morning -getting over-night flts ready for departure. Calulating load factors. managing people that are assigned to help and communicating w/ flight crew.

good,It is a wonderful and very good company. It is something I will forever hold close. It will be everything you could ever want in a company.
good,"Worked for SWA in Technology for over 13 years and I have loved every minute of it. People will tell you that the folks at HDQ are drinking the koolaid, and yes, it's true. This is the best place to work, hands-down in all my 35 years of working life! I will never leave voluntarily. Playtime and privileges are fun, but we also work our tushies off!"
good,"Southwest airlines is a great company to be apart of. They truly care for their employees and have a fun & luving spirit!,"
good,"The best place that I have ever worked. The atmosphere was always up (at least amongst the employees and for the most part amongst the passengers too). As large as we became (from when I started there July 1979 and ended in September 2000) it remainded a very family oriented company. Herb and Colleen were the best motivators that SWA has ever had (they along with meany others were the back bone of the airline) and I feel so blessed to have been able to learn as much from them about what it means to be a great customer service representative as well as a good human being. I knew them both personally as well as on the job. They inspired me to want to be the best and taught me how to win over people in general as well as for SWA. I love them both to this day, January 18, 2012."
good,Its a great company to work for. You do your best and you will succeed.
good,I loved working as a Flight Attendant for Southwest Airlines. It was before 9/11/01 and so life in the sky was a little more laid back than it is today. My employer was great! They knew how to have fun and encouraged it on and off the plane.
