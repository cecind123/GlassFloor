bad,"Lots of turnover and favoritism. Unattainable goals for the store traffic..can reach goals on sale days! Also, I had aquired vacation that I was unable to take till I had been there 18 months...made no sense."
bad,"You are thrown to the wolves. In any position you are expected to know everything and answer to everything without any training. The store manager is a joke. He is never on the floor and doesn't know anything about his employees. They preach that care is what drives the company but when things go wrong it's ""only business"". You get brought into the Dillard's family anget hung out to dry with no support."
bad,"I worked for Dillards for almost a year and it was the worst job ever!! The managers treat you and talk to you so disrespectful most of the time. They want you to reach completely unrealistic goals, if you don't reach them they fire you. They don't care for you as a person they only care about themselves and their numbers. They can cut your hours and have you working 13 hours a week sometimes. Working here is just a depressing job and a boring atmosphere if it's not holiday season. If you want decent pay sure work here, but you can find that at a better job. I will say you will have some dope co-workers. That was the only thing I liked about the job.. I met my boyfriend who I've been with for almost a year there, and I made a lot of new close friends."
bad,Upper management DO NOT care for you.Schedules are not properly handled correctly.Quota is insane.Managers let associates bully(harassment)around Store with one another.You can get into car accident or not even attend to your own family funeral. Because that is not important to dillards.ALWAYS short staffed due to schedules not being made correctly. People getting fired and quitting left and right.
bad,"They don't care about anything other than the bottom line $. Management doesn't acknowledge any positives or good things done, will only point out any shortfalls. Very conservative and not open to different views"
bad,"Poor work environment, management only supports you if they like you, they will stress you out and treat you as if you are doing something wrong because of the fact that this is a dying store and there is no successful constant foot traffic through the store."
bad,"Very racist. Shows a lot of favoritism and you're work does not speak for itself. You have to be an invertebrate to continue within the company and still it's no guarantee that you are secure, nor will u be looked out for."
bad,"This store lacks leadership from Store Manager. A minority employee will have higher starting pay, better treatment, and  bad behavior overlooked.  Sad."
bad,"Work here if you want to be overworked, underappreciated and talked to disrespectfully. Management here is terrible and untrustworthy. They are against thier own management team, with an immature and selfish aspect towards leadership. The high demand of devotion and tolerance to this company with no reciprocation is a complete waste of your hard work and time."
bad,The job had awful management and very little respect for employees. There was very little support from management and there was zero life/work balance.
bad,"The Third Party Brand Reps in the beauty department are amazing and will try to do what they can to support the counter. However, Dillard’s Store level management are terrible, they do not provide the necessary tools for their counters to be successful, and do the opposite of what the brand suggests. Management sets you up for failure by setting goals that are not achievable. A commercial department trying to be a luxury store without understanding the difference of the two."
bad,"Not enough room to say all the negative things about this place and the management. No support, favoritisms, micromanaging, Drama, rude, disrespectful managers etc."
bad,"Lied about compensation on job ad. Employees more rude & disrespectful than the customers were, especially to dock associates. Very toxic environment."
bad,"The sales goals are high and put pressure on employees. Teammates did not create a nice environment for work; often gossiping and ""stealing"" sales from others. Management would look the other way from the gossiping/bullying and rewarded the top sales performers."
bad,"As much as I enjoy working in retail, this job has definitely been the worst job I've ever had. One main thing that is a problem is management, I felt belittled most of the time, he/she was horribly unorganized, an unsupportive manager that definitely does NOT do their job. Quotas are ridiculous, which leaves great and hardworking employees automatically terminated. Definitely the most toxic environment to work in; you will have aggressively competitive co-workers. Horrible company overall that completely concentrates on the numbers and not on the employees that makes the numbers. I truly do not recommend this job to anyone. Be stress-free and continue to search for a better job!"
bad,"This is a very poorly managed company.  There is no work-life balance. They have no interest in values, integrity, or any type of investment in their people.  Turnover is high, people who were vested have left and continue to leave.  Sales is truly their only interest.  They tell you when you can and can’t be off, limit vacation times, expect you to work on your days off.  If you have  family you will never see them."
bad,"Terrible culture, terrible owners,terrible benefits, worked every Saturday, "
bad,Dillards is a company you would not love working at. They don't care about employees and their store comes before your family and friends and your life outside of the store. They don't run by policy's that are stated in their handbook. I personally worked there for three years and made my all of my raise goals and I never received a raise. Not even a good job or way to go. Corporate is rude and they are dirty to every employee no matter how long you have worked for them.
bad,"Unfair place to work ,management will change your work status without letting you know ,was told no chance for pay increase after being employed over 1 year, no holiday pay,no vacation time, people who unload trucks get paid $3-$5 LESS than everyone else."
bad,"Sucksbig time"
bad,Management sucks. There is so much drama and back stabbing going on. You tell management about the wrong doing of employees and against policy they do nothing about it.
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked, they don’t care about what your outside life is. You must be at work unless you tell them you’re not coming. Only good part about working here was the pay."
bad,"This place in Billngs, MT was the worst job I have ever had in my life. This job is full of horrible human beings that talk poorly about you and others constantly. If you think you can avoid the pointless drama this place throws at you, good luck, you will always get sucked into it at some point. They don't promote those that deserve it. Only those that kiss up to the managers and don't rat out the unethical things managers do here. Cosmetic manager was by far the worst manager/ person in this whole place. Do not waste your time!"
bad,"They will use you until you’re worn out. They don’t care for you. They treat you very unprofessional. If you aren’t making them money, they’ll kick you to the curb. Just don’t work here. Or at least the one at northpark. It’s very frustrating and nerve wrecking to work with managers who are so immature. But the executives will always choose to side with the manager instead of you so if you ask me, it’s a waste of time to work there :)"
bad,"Horrible they don’t care about you you’re  just a number.If you don’t meet your quota you’ll get fired.They expected you to get credit cards every day and to make 2,000 dollars a day.the managers are fake they’ll act like they’re your friends but they’re really not."
bad,"This place really made me depressed the hours worked there where a torture. They push you to do exaggerated sale numbers that realisticly only two people working really hard would meet together. The bad attitude of managers make you feel worthless. If they in a bad mood they make you feel like it’s your fault. "
bad,"Most of the management here is horrible and highly unprofessional. The company sets unrealistic quotas and has harsh punishments for not meeting said goals. There is no job security and can be fired for any little thing. The company not managers care about their employees well being or mental health. I was more than qualified for the position I held and was paid as much as a part timer, being that I was full time. Would not recommend this company or location to anyone."
bad,The company doesn’t hire the right management team. The store manager makes work extremely unpleasant. They gave me the worst department expecting unrealistic numbers. You are not a person you’re just a number at this job. May be suitable for part time students who just want a pay check. That’s about it.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations. Sales goals in order to bonus were completely unrealistic you have to get customers a dillards credit card ias part of your sales goal. If you dont hit your goal, your hourly pay is cut. "
bad,I worked their for nine months and the management is awful. They are disrespectful and do not care about their employees. They did not train me at all and I had to guess and figure stuff out on my own. They like to talk about your business to everyone. Its just a bad place. The store sucks and so does the management. If you want to work here because its 13/hr really consider if it worth losing mental health.
bad,"Pressure employees to open credit, pre-sell items that are not out yet, sell cbd products that are not fda approved or regulated. Unrealistic sales quotas. No formal training. Varies store by store. Corporate visits every month or 2. No human resource department. Sexual harassment complaints not followed up on. I could go on and on."
bad,You will be set up to fail.!!!! No support from management.  Just an awful place to work. Managers take over some sales you are working on and they keep the credit.  This works against your goals.  Then they punish you for not making your goals by taking away from your hourly pay.  Just not right.
bad,"I was manager at Chanel counter and l was harassing and bullying by my employees that from the beginning was not happy or welcome to be the manager because my nationality and my language the managers ask me to change my ethics and personality from the company, only because one employee is there for more than 7 years. From the beginning l was not value, feel discriminated, at the point my account manager  was helping me to be fired. My experience with Dillard’s in the past was  amazing at San Angelo Texas but in Amarillo was horrible!"
bad,They don’t care about you having a life make their goal and be their chia pet (which is easy) My father died and still wanted me to stay and finish out my shift.
bad,"I worked in the ladies shoes department. We had a base hourly pay, plus commission on a draw system. Meaning that before we could actually earn commission, we had to earn the company what they were paying us. "
bad,"This company sets you up to fail.  If you want a job with advancement opportunities then Dillard’s is not the place for you.  The only way into a management or supervisor position is to be hired on as one.  These are also the only positions that have any kind of job security.  As an associate you will likely be gone anywhere from 6-12 months for not meeting unrealistic sales goals, that is if you get past the horrible and discouraging work environment or poor guidance from incompetent and uninterested management team"
bad,"Discrimination, your face has to match the profile , extremely bad management, if you make more money than your manager, they will set you up and fire you.  The worst   place to work, extreme bullying on the floor, the managers love watching the bullying and will join in.  The lazy people just stand at the register, the hard workers are given a very hard time."
bad,"I wouldn’t even recommend my worst enemy in the world to work here. The worst environment. No work life balance. They don’t care about your family or home life. They’ll ask you to come in early and you’re not compensated for it. When your scheduled to work longer than 6 hours on a Sunday (or any day) they don’t allow you a lunch break, which is illegal. I don’t see them being in businesses in the next 7 years."
bad,To me Dillards and there quotas are a little much because how often do you change you bedroom and bathroom. And always wanting associate's to follow the customer they do not like that.
bad,Not sure if it’s the  lack of humanity or lack  of knowledge. Dillard’s is by far one of the worst company’s I’ve even worked for. Day by day I fell like I fall deeper into depression by just the thought of knowing I have to go back the next day. Managers feel like they can talk to you anyway they see fit since the company doesn’t have an actual hr. I wish I could explain all of the horrible things that happen but sadly I’d need to write a whole book for that .
bad,Was a very bad environment. Management was bad and disrespectful and very condescending. Low pay for position i was in. Management would tell you your replaceable to your face.
bad,I would rate this company with zero stars if I could. Too much favoritism with managers and a select few associates. Absolutely disrespectful and no professionalism on managers’ parts whatsoever. Managers are clueless and never know about anything going on in the store such as promotional events. They’re ultimate goal is to push out employees wishing six months that they do not like on personal levels. Their idea of coaching is to literally insult and degrade you in hopes of getting better results.
bad,"Management is poorly organized, clearly plays favorites and is absolutely unprofessional. They don't care about you as an employee, and you're 100% expendable. You are scheduled a month in advance and are unable to swap shifts or reorganize your schedule if anything comes up. They start you with a great hourly rate only later to dangle it in your face constantly and give you ridiculous and unachievable sales goals. There is such a gap between the associates' hourly rates that if you discuss your hourly with someone else, you'll be fired for it. They are family owned by a a very conservative family from the South, and their dress code and behavior reflects that. There is no point in trying to talk to management about anything because they'll dismiss you with ""well, what are you going to do about it"", and there is no HR department to contact to escalate any situations. I wouldn't recommend this place of work to anyone, ever."
bad,Dillards expectations from its managers and staff are almost impossible to meet.  They provide very little actual training and have a sink or swim attitude towards its employees.  Schedules were demanded at the benefit of the store only with no consideration for its employees personal life
bad,"Expect us to hit a certain SPH which is unrealistic, sets up to fail with a failing store, the turn over rate is terrible. Wouldn't recommend anyone with a family to work here as they do not worry about family life outside. All they care about is numbers without advertising to help try and get their employees more customers."
bad,"I worked for them 17 and 1/2 yrs.,pay LOUSY. I needed to stay in the area for most of the years to take care of my parents. I had a little lead-way sometimes for that. They are both deceased now. I had perfect attendance, all the time but could not keep as my co-workers would keep quiting. Scheduling is made 1 month in advance.  Great part time job Only."
bad,The people who are already work there that have been there for years talk about other employees & cause animosity towards one another. They're very territorial & competition is very sickening. I hardly ever saw management & was left lo learn on my own. If you don't make sales quota the your pay is increased. The people I worked with were very snooty & not friendly & very long hours. 10 hrs a day 6 days a week & the stress really got to me on my day (yes one day off)to me. It wasn't worth the money. The walk from clock in to clock out to break room took 20 minutes & then bathroom breaks were taken in between customers who sometimes had you pull 25 pairs before you could take a break because no one else was allowed to check out that customer.
bad,"Worked this  location for 7 months. Unrealistic expectations and sometimes 2 weeks without days off. Store manager manes racist jokes, laughed in my face when I requested time off to visit family SIX months ahead and was told it was fine only to have it denied for no reason and to “deal with it.”"
bad,"They have sales goals you have to meet which are unreasonable.. it creates work enemies. Everyone is fighting for sales. When you dont meet them, you are let go.  Also, there are no customers in the store, everything is online.  The longer term associates steal your sales therefore it's harder to reach your goal.  Some managers steal your sales too. This business cannot make it with outdated sales goals and online shopping and Amazon industry.   Not an organized business and so dysfunctional in so many ways.   "
bad,"I hated working at Dillard's.  They are strict and suspicious.  My mother always told me,""if it isn't yours, don't take it."". I therefore am a very trustworthy person who will never steal from an employer, yet I was watched carefully and suspiciously at every shift!  I felt like a thief!  My boss was a snotty woman who thought the world revolves around Dillard's"
bad,"VERY negative HOSTILE environment . No teamwork. Managements first priority is keeping the employee turnover rate above 100 % . They refer to Friday as "
bad,The manager stayed in office and had a bunch of young college kids there just to get a paycheck. The few older ladies would be made to stop doing our work in our designated areas and go take care of there sections. They would stand and watch.
bad,Hard to make personal goals when no one shops there. Very hard to get full time. Hard to get the days off you want. Management needs to take human resources classes to be more productive.
bad,"They have the worst management!!! Every single day in the morning all the employees that are working morning shift would bring their coffee and right when you get to the clock in machines the managers will make you throw it away!! But tell me why 15 minutes after opening the store all the managers would go and get their coffees!!! Also if you ask for a personal day or a day off their most likely will deny it!!! Another thing is that if you are one of their top sellers. No matter what you do, for them it’s ok!!!!!!! And why am I saying this is because whenever i worked there they let a lot off stuff pass to this employee who checked her self out while she was on the clock, also she could be having phone calls in front of the store Manager and still wouldn’t get in trouble! YES like I’m saying she wouldn’t get in trouble for doing that or  even better she would go and work only morning schedules even if she was supposed to close the store she would never do it... and I could say more but it’s just a waist of time y’all. Another thing that they have (talking about management). They would always give you a look head to toes to check how you was looking and would make some type of faces.   And let’s not forget the way they talk to the employees, they can seem all nice but they’re always cussing out to the employees."
bad,"Management is a JOKE, they place favorites, they disrespectfully y’all at you, the managers discuss everything with other employees. The pay is ok, but the commission structure for ladies shoes is a joke. The manager of that department is a disgrace to the company, the turnover rate is extremely high. I DONT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE AT ALL. I don’t recommend shopping here either."
bad,"Worst company to work for"
bad,The management is HORRIBLE. They do not care about they’re employees. Definitely do not recommend no one working here. Everyone I used to work with hated coming into work each and every single day.
bad,"Daily quota, don’t meet your SPH, fired at review time which it’s ridiculous when there’s no customers but they don’t care. Management is horrible!!!!"
bad,"If you value professionalism and dignity stay out off this place ."
bad,"Store management is so rude and insensitive towards everyone. Store manager does nothing but sit in office and bark orders over the PA system and everyone is upset, un-happy or angry on how the upper management uses their authority to abuse by micro managing, just standing around, gossiping, or excluding others from communication. They let anyone work there who just stands around to gossip"
bad,"Management asks employees to work off the clock, and take merchandise in their own vehicles to sell at different locations without gas compensation or insurance. When employees refused, they were written up, bullied, moved to different departments, or forced out of the company."
bad,"I do not recommend working at Dillard's."
bad,"Dillards has a way of taking earned income away from their associates,  they tell one thing and do another, rules of the handbook changes weekly, their management dont no how to talk to others, they like to try to provoke their associates. Common sense do not exist in there, logic is an understatement."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked for the management is the worst, I would never work for that company again! I worked for almost 5 years and my last 2 years were horrific"
bad,"Decent starting pay for a job with no needed experience, but expect to work every weekend, nights and days. No set schedule in place and hard to get days off. Difficult sales goals. You have to actually be a salesperson to work here. Oh, and TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. *I’ve never even had a major problem with management. They are just extremely rude and disrespectful."
bad,"Worst choice I’ve ever made. Anything you can imagine has happened. Associates smoking in the fitting rooms, associates stealing, drama, bullying, and favoritism. Don’t do it!!"
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE. management is horrible they do not care about their associates. They do not care if you have a life outside of work. Dillards thinks of their associates as warm bodies on the floor. They do not respect their associates or customers. If you want to be disrespected, manipulated and taken advantage of then this is the place for you."
bad,"Is a horrible place to work ,they don’t allow you to take breaks and they know people work of the clock to meet the sells goals,when you have a problem or a complaint is worse if you let the manager know and the store Maneger tell you that she doesn’t care if you let the Dillards know ,she thinks she can do anything she wants .she is rude and don’t care for employees"
bad,"Negative and toxic  work environment. Poor Coaching skills from Management team. Favoritism , Very resistant to change. There is no support to develop a brand."
bad,I would never work for this company ever again nor would I support them with my business. The entire company is structured on sales and the employees are very cutthroat when it comes to theirs and any other associate coming into their department with a guest
bad,"Dillard’s is a company that only cares about sales not employees, if you do not meet your goal your fired. Management is constantly pushing credit apps, threats to assign a morning class to discuss how to improve credit."
bad,same as above. very picky. not very pleasant.  very hostile when dealing with part time people.  the place sucks. Would never work there again not shop there again.
bad,i once got sick and even though my pants were soiled i was sent home to get more clothes on a small time frame and was expected back at work that day and was told to consider it my lunch. the management has no sympathy for anything their employees go through unless you are in a management position. this place is full of false promises on promotion and a very stressful environment to work in because of store management
bad,"Daily sales quotas are changed after the day is over. "
bad,"Can’t say one good thing about this place. Truthfully. I guess the flexibility of hours can be helpful to some, but definitely not worth working here. You are booted immediately if you don’t hit the number in sales required (which is sometimes unrealistic due to the store as a whole being slow) without any consideration for any other strengths you may have. In the short year I was employed, my department alone ran through about 11 girls. Turn over rate is just insane."
bad,Dillard’s treats there employees horribly and you can get fired for the smallest thing. I would never work for them again. They have no respect for those who come in every day and work really hard
bad,"Was good place to work in beginning,but they brought in a new store manager,horrible person fired most of department managers!So they wonder why their sales are down!"
bad,Just be prepared to be a slave.   U have to work in area on your sales times which basically puts you in deficit. Management sucks they don’t care all they want is numbers and credit apps. Quotas are very high especially if u work in a full commission dept. (ladies shoes). Then u have these racks that only pay 3% and all customers go for that which affects your quota. Not a good place to work
bad,You will be unhappy just save the trouble and managment don't really care about you. You will have stress and anxiety come your way as soon as you start working here. They don't work with you if you have kids so just think 3x over before working here
bad,The managers was very ugly to the Black employee. I work for Three and a half years there and my White manager refuse to make me full time. We even had to call and ask to go to the restroom.
bad,Management is terrible expected to do things outside your job description and not get paid for it no respect or raises ever cant take your earned vacation hours how you want always limited help to get things done on time
bad,"This store is full of managers who have no clue how to successfully run a store, which is half the reason why this store is failing after the hurricane. Favoritism is a huge problem here. The store manager has no backbone and doesn't handle associate complaints/concerns because he doesn't like confrontation.  All employees are required to make their sales quotas, even when there's no customers in the store. Dillards doesn't care about their employees, all they care about is making money! Don't work here. You'll regret it."
bad,The work place is a joke.  The store manager is unrealistic.  goals unrealistic.  People very catty.  Not a nice place to work. Employees  are not nice to fellow employees.
bad,management is horrible and unstable. refused to call me the right name for months. “forgets” anything you request on your schedule. wants you to sell to nonexistent clients. they act like they know trends but are so caught up in their own world they don’t know what’s going on in the real one. good hours if you don’t want to have a life outside of work. acts like we “strict” rules and policies to follow but will kiss up to any bad customer that comes
bad,Poor leadership skills. You are just a dumb employee to them. If you don’t make your sales goals you get terminated and walked out the store like a thief by the managers. Degrading company. Stay away!!!
bad,I worked for this company for six months. My co-workers were great. The management not so much. The sales goals are unrealistic in the particular place and the hours. They staffed too many people at the same time and expected everyone in the department to meet goals. I worked in the accessory department. There was never many big sales there during the week.
bad,The managers  are beyond incompetent.  There is no work life  balance.  This is not the place to work if you have a family. This is a terrible  Company to work  for. This company  is greedy and they dont care about  you.
bad,"Dillard's warehouse in Maumelle are very racists. The upper management hires all their family members such as wives, sons, daughters, in laws as advanced positions as clericals, managers, etc. who had little to no experience. They tell you that there isn't a bar for the amount of money that could be made hourly; however when you do the work and get the production out they cap off your money made. Tamper with your production which predicts your hourly money made. They post only the jobs that they don't want for their relatives. The supervisors aren't qualified for their jobs and do not know how to talk to their employees. They lack people skills and sure manager skills. They constantly implement more tasks for your job but don't increase the pay per unit or new tasks. Very unfair job, I wouldn't recommend working here for advancement but if you just want a weekly check paying atleast $11.50 hourly and give a 25% discount and 45% off employee sales."
bad,"Dillards is a very very stressful work environment, the scheduling is not flexible, the management is not friendly,and the pay is not worth the work that you will have to do alone. The work culture is honestly very stressful, time consuming, most of the up selling you are required to do goes unappreciated and you barely get recognized for the time and work ethic you contribute to the company."
bad,Dillard’s is a very stressful place to work they Constantly on they sale Associate you have so many items per customer you have to push this item you have get so many customers to apply for credit cards and they don’t promote with in not family  orient you can’t get time off for no occasion no weekends or holiday they tell you when you can take your vacation it’s all about their bottom line they are not for the  Minority
bad,"There is a reason Dillards is constantly on the Worst Companies To Work For list. I will not go into the nitty gritty details, just trust me-you do not want to work here."
bad,"Clothes thrown everywhere, to many arguments, not enough workers in certain areas. "
bad,This is the worst place to work for and they do not care about the employees.  They are only considered about meeting your sales quotes for each day.  The managers/supervisors are rude and disrespectfully to the employees.  I wouldn't let my DOG work at any Dillard's.
bad,"If your focused on job security, this is NOT the job for you. It is sale based and they have ridiculous goals. You won’t have your job because you can’t control sales"
bad,Don't even try! Run from this company as quick as possible! The store manager is clearly not as qualified  as he thinks he is. The company does not pay as much as it promises.
bad,"Not a good place to work. I nside racism. Favoritism,as long adyou sale, management doesnt care how you treat coworkers. Management very unprofessional and not trsined yo handie employees personal issues. I woild not recommend any one working there. Employees are encouraged to lie to customers as long as they send the customer away happy."
bad,"This has been the worst position I've ever held! "
bad,"Not the type of job for me.  Too much responsibility on the associate. "
bad,"Dillard’s in PORT ARTHUR is Horrible!!! They have unrealistic sales goals,  management treats you like your a child and they have favoritism! It’s a good job to work at for a few months cause of the pay but no more that 3 months!"
bad,"When you go to work every day in a great mood but the upper management is consistently in a fowl mood,....then run. Run out the door and don’t look back. How are you going to be happy there if they’re not. You won’t. Red FLAG 🚩🚩"
bad,"Literally one of the worst places to work in Houma LA.  Management is terrible and show favoritism,  they are not fare with associates and pick and bully certain ones and management does NOTHING about it."
bad,"I'm sure other locations are better, but at my location almost everyone acted like middle school girls gossiping. Within my first week I had other employees come up to me tell me how they hate other coworkers, or to not trust certain managers. Also, after my first week I was left in charge to open and close the entire women's shoe department by myself. I had no prior retail experience and no one even taught me how to change the receipt paper in the registers. "
bad,This was by far the worst place I have ever worked.  They treat you like a prisoner. I had to stay at work with bloody pants on for 3 hours because I was not allowed to leave. My job was threatened. Pay cuts are the norm. Hostile work environment. Management is extremely rude. Management tell lies. Very stressful working there.
bad,"Too much work for the pay. The “sharks” are the manager’s favorites even if they  don’t do their job, just sell and make the others associate life miserable. Do not work there unless you want to be stressed all day long"
bad,"Hourly sales focus place, would not recommend this place for long term work, no any training are provided for new employees, most department  managers are harassing, lazy and stupid."
bad,"Dillards has made the top 10 worse companies to work for several times. "
bad,They pay $13.00 per hour for dock workers when they basically run the store they clean the store then unload trucks then have to process all the product and deliver to what department its supposed to go too. Along with that you have to answer calls for lazy associates who wont come and get stuff themselves. Some people are cool. Management in the higher ups will stab you in the back. Ask anyone who worked on the dock they will tell you it's the worst.
bad,"Horrible experience. I would never work here again. They are unfair, racist, they don’t let you spend time with your family, managers won’t help you. Basically like going back to High School. No phones, no talking to anyone except for costumers. They would write you up for everything and anything. No respect towards associates. They would fire you for your sales even though they know it’s slow season. So unprofessional, specially cosmetics department."
bad,Very hard to meet daily quotas. They will cut your pay if you don’t meet your quota and they will fire you for not meeting your quota. Returns go against your quota as well.
bad,Dillard's doesn't care about its employees just the numbers. Which by the way are ridiculous and unattainable with the lack of business. Managers are egotistical and unintouched. Show favoritism and make up rules as they go. At least at my store. Wouldn't suggest my worst enemy to work there...
bad,"The micromanaging and unrealistic expectations of the company are astounding. Not only do you need to make your sales quota today, you will also be constantly asked to push FUTURE sales. Depending on the Store Managers there's usually a hostile environment between all mangers, and a general lack of ""dont care, not my responsibility"". Its a sink or swim environment and they'll make sure you drown."
bad,Working for Dillard's Sucks!!! Worst job ever! Unrealistic quota and sales and associates are fired if they don't meet their quota. There's a high turnover with sales associates every 90 days due to Dillard's constantly replacing associates. They can't keep good hard working employees because they fire them. Working for Dillard's was the worst experience for me.
bad,Dillard's is a terrible place to work. My cosmetic manager encouraged gossip and favored one person. They are racist and talk political at work.  I wouldn't recommend working at the Colorado  Springs location or any. It is a miserably place to work.
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had. The work environment is so negative and toxic. Unbelievably high sales goals turn coworkers against one another and make customers feel uncomfortable. The harder you work the worse you are treated. This company has no respect for their employees and expect for Dillards to be their employees only priority. No work-life balance, you have to fight managers for any requested days off. No matter how hard working or reliable you are they will still treat you like trash. My departments manager was the most negative and heartless woman I've ever met. The only good thing is the pay, which for the area is quite good. However, they trap their employees with this pay, making it harder for them to escape this miserable work place. While I was employed there the store lost over 20 employees within a 3 month period. Do not work here unless you are desperate, this company will take a huge toll on your mental health."
bad,Dillard's concentrates on sales.  The company does not embrace employee welfare.  It was common to hear employees complain that they felt under-appreciated and over-worked.  This was my experience also.  Looking for employment that I can look forward to engaging positively every day.
bad,I hated working there in PENSACOLA FL.The girls there a jealous of others and fight for sales.There is this girl in cosmetic that has been there for years that is a jealous trouble maker.
bad,"since place is profit driven, sales people are pressured to make daily goals"
bad,"Unreal quotas , managers breathe down your neck for credit applications. They don’t see you as humans only as numbers and sales . Managers encourage you to fight for sales with coworkers. Very competitive and no one is really your friend. Only nice to you when you make huge sales or get a credit application."
bad,"Unrealistic quota requirements, will promise full time upon hire and never give it to you no matter how hard you work, lots of drama on the work floor. They will fire you for not meeting the unrealistic goals set forth. You're just a number and easily replaceable and you will be made aware of that every day."
bad,"Where to begin. This store is a disaster. The management is catty, rude, and plays favorites. Coworkers steal sales and bully one another. Sales goals are unattainable considering the store is failing. Very slow and boring work. A customer once commented to me: ""does anyone ever smile around here?"" and the answer is no because all the employees are dead inside. A lot of negativity. Definitely not worth the cushy pay."
bad,Worked my tail off off for Dillard's while my wife was dying of cancer got fired when it was our only income these ruthless people fired me one day after l submitted my FMLA paperwork .No loyalty no remorse after 7 years of faithfull service.So glad that l did get fired that place was just awful no love no respect.Just sell sell sell.
bad,"This is not a place that you want to be. It was a boring job, and promoted a culture of cut throat unethical sales. I learned what a toxic work environment is and lousy management."
bad,This company does not care about its employees. They just care about sales. They pit their employees against each other and create a hostile work environment. Management plays favorites and are rarely on the same page. Retention is very low. They offer no training. DO NOT WORK HERE.
bad,The management had a complete disconnect from the employees.  There was no acknowledgement of a job well done or a goal met. Only negative reinforcement.
bad,"Management expect high sakes quotas even if there's no customers coming into the stores, they expect you to do floor moves and other activities at the same time meeting your sales quota"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend people to work here honestly. They don't provide enough hours unless you're working on the sales floor, which has a ton of weird rules to follow."
bad,"First off, they make it seem like you are getting a good deal and pay but they catch is if you don't make your sph standard when your review date comes around you will lose up to a dollar or more in pay essentially getting a pay cut. You have to work new years day for their big sale and if you call out you are fired no execptions. There is no human resource in the store so guess what that means If you have a nasty person on the sales floor who makes lots of money and is close with the managers they are going to look the other way and ignore you, They are willing to overlook racism, homophobia, transphobia if it means that their top sellers are safe.They really are one the worst places to work for. I suggest macys, nordstrom or even saks. Dillards is a joke"
bad,"Indeed has guidelines for how they want you to write these reviews so here goes.."
bad,to the salesmanthis job doesn't pay much no raises are given only don't work here not the time they work you so hard for little pay not worth it I will never work here again
bad,"This is the worst place I’ve ever worked, I could only stay for not even a week. The hours DRAG, they are 10 hour long shifts with extremely unrealistic sales goals. The management is snobby and rude. The rules are idiotic such as you have to park like 10 minutes away from the actual door you can’t go in through any glass doors and not through the mall entrance. You have to stand all day with nothing to do. ITS THE WORST, I DONT EVER RECOMMEND"
bad,I did not like working in an environment where I had to spy on anybody who looked different. I did not have breaks and bathroom breaks. People at Dillards were not happy.
bad,"I worked part-time. I’ve never worked retail before but It was not what i expected It to be. The company lives for fake people and tattletales. It’s very cutthroat with the high quotas. Employees will steal your customers that you even been working with for hours. The people who survive at Dillard’s are the selfish ones. "
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Lose there best employees through lying, holding promotions over your head the will hire from the outside. Impossible goals retail is going bye bye and I hope they are next"
bad,"Dillard’s wasn’t the best place to work and wasn’t a very secure job to have, pay was minimal and they expected a lot from they’re employees. But I did learn a lot."
bad,"I can only speak on the Temple Mall location in Temple, TX. I was fired within 6 months from starting and saw at least 30 other people get fired for same reasons while I worked there for not meeting their sales quotas. They are a hire to fire company and the majority of employees have been fired within 4-6 months of starting. This store used to be profitable until they moved locations and stopped selling a large portion of what the customers were buying. This forced at least 50% of their customers to shop at the Dillards in Killeen, Waco, even Austin. This in turn made their sales quotas unobtainable because of the decrease in business. Racks are completely overstocked in some departments because no one is buying anything and at least 75% of their store is marked down to 65% off. Their departments are arranged to look like a dollar store, racks packed so tight you can barely sort thru them without things falling on the floor or hangers breaking. Customers won't shop here because of how ugly the store is. They didnt even remodel before they moved into this location, the walls are fabic and stained, carpet is stained, tile floor has cracks in it. Rumor has it this store won't be open in the next two years, corporate hinted they will take dillards out of temple mall. Dont work here, it's a sinking ship."
bad,"without a shout. hands down. WORST PLACE IVE EVER WORKED. dont get me wrong. i loved some of the people, but others (management) were too consumed in themselves, never gave coaching or training. every goal they set for my department atleast, was completely unrealistic. they didnt want to hear facts"
bad,"you always got to be pushy to make sales , they had there little favorites the managers and if you were not one then they would treat  you bad , they sometimes changed schedules without u knowing"
bad,"Horrible place to work,"
bad,I was unable to take my cancer medications which was discussed upon hiring and unable to leave the building on my 15 minute breaks. Very negative department manager and negative comments in regards to my needs to take medications at work. Horrible place to work and absolutely no training. Policies change weekly and department managers give special treatment to some and not others. Unfair business practices and sales practices are aggressive and competitive. Every body complains about the employer and makes for a very unenjoyable work day. Even without cancer....
bad,The truth is we are not a little more domestic and the s the bible is the best thing that we do in our lives and we have to do that and the other things are
bad,"I worked part-time for Dillards in Wellington, FL. All managers treat the employees like dogs. They put so much pressure to obtain credits from customers that customers literally get upset when they are hounded to open a Dillards Credit Card every time they shop there. They even have a large poster board with all employees names and and each employee gets a big STAR when they open a credit card. At the morning ""pep rally"" they actually call out employees if they haven't opened any credits yet for the week! They would ask all those that have not opened a credit yet, to raise your hand!!!! Really? To make an employee feel badly? Your employment is based on meeting your quotas. But how the heck can you possibly meet your quota when there are NO CUSTOMERS!!!!! You only last a few months before you are laid off for not meeting your quota. The people who have been there for years are so cut throat that if you even go near a customer that they feel is there customer, they will literally berate you and managers will do nothing.  They do there own markdowns, so instead of tending to customers, you are literally spending all day marking down merchandise. Most unprofessional and ridiculous way of running a retail store."
bad,"When I was offered a job at Dillard's I was really excited. Over the years I had been in and it seemed great. When I started working there however, I realized that the employees only acted the way they did because they were constantly horrified of losing their jobs. It was a very cookie cutter place, and if you didn't fit in you were treated horribly, until you wanted to quit. Management was horrible and childish. The male manager was a complete pervert and you could tell the female slept her way into her position. It's all a high power Trip, and if you don't make your completely ridiculous sales requirement you're fired. I would rather dig graves than work for this company and I would do everything in my power to prevent anyone I know from applying. I was seldom given a break, let alone go to the bathroom without feeling worthless. I hated working for this company. Don't do it."
bad,"I was able to read a full chapter book by various authors during most of my shifts, plus the associates I worked with were more interested in discussing their private lifes around the childrens sections. And if you sold in another dep't, the salary was messed up on how sales were calculated"
bad,"To sum it up, I wasn't even allowed to take a day off to take my son to a specialist in another town that I had planned months prior and requested off for well in advance. Nor was I allowed to attend my own child's birthday party. There is absolutely no work/life balance and our managers were (and apparently still are) treacherous. Just as soon as someone qualifies for retirement, the managers move them to a new area of the store and then fire them when they don't perform well in that area. Sales goals are unrealistic, they can't keep anyone because it's ridiculous, and their pre-sale system is so antiquated. One of our supervisors was even fired abruptly and she had worked for the company for years. Avoid this place like the plague - it's worse."
bad,"management is the worst they have no idea what are they doing , the new store manager have not experience at all and he manage the store with fear is like a monkey with a gun"
bad,"Lots of heavy lifting."
bad,"Everything is sales based, including your pay. You are given high sales goals to meet, and if you do not meet these goals, your pay gets cut by however much you missed your goal by. For example, if you are 10% under the assigned sales goal, you get your pay cut by 10%. If you are over by 10% you get a 10% raise, but the goals are always set so high that it's nearly impossible to reach this without stealing sales from other employees. This creates such a hostile work environment, lots of backstabbing and employee disagreements. The managers also rarely back up their employees."
bad,"Working at Dillard's is an absolute nightmare. The whole store and company is so unorganized. They work you to DEATHHHH!!! If you care about yourself, you wouldn't work here."
bad,Not a good work environment at all!! Sales goals are unrealistic. Associates are treated like numbers and not people. The WORST place I've ever worked. Dillards has so much that could be going fantastic but as long as they hang on to the antiquated systems that they use the stores and sales people will unfortunately struggle!
bad,"Beware of the ASM and store manager. Their goals are not to help you succeed but to keep their own jobs. Dillard's like to keep a hostile environment. They have a LP camera person and a paid guard, however they don't do anything. No one answer the phone when there is a theft. One of my friend got fired, they claimed she put a MOS pen in her purse. No proof or video. I worked there for 8 years, during for 6 years I was number one in my work area for the regine. I was forced to retire because my store manage would only take complaints from other associate who was not making their numbers. I of course did not have any opportunity to say anything. Was never asked if to hear my side. I was told to retire or I will not get my vacation pay."
bad,"My last departments was shoes and very stressful with commission employees and stock and a volume of over 4 million. Conditions were very hard, and stock was on 2 floors"
bad,"People that have been there a long time have it easy. There is an unwritten code of tattle tales. They snitch and get away with little to no work. If you are in your supervisors behind, you will get far in this place. If you are visible, you will be asked to do more. The three month waiting period is not real and totally non-existent for you to get used to the little made up rules. It is not an easy place to work at if you got ethics"
bad,Meet your daily sales goals. If you dont meet you goals. you go into negative and it starts to accumulate. If you arent making what you are supposed to you are subject to being fired
bad,"They don't know how to manage employees. They will not work with you on scheduling, so if you have a second job (which you need since they give you only 28 hours max) you will have to make sure that the second job knows that your schedule can and frequently does change at the last second."
bad,The management was extremely deceitful and dishonest. Many of my co-workers or promised certain positions and then put into others that didn't even involve their expertise promotions were also promised and never granted. The hardest part was watching the people you worked with being told that they need to either resign or they will be fired and never rehireable and another Dillards again. Eyewitness more people get fired on false pretenses in order to not have to pay them their paid vacation times Etc. I absolutely lost all respect for the managers at my location I guess that's what they have to do in order to keep moving up however I will never be a part of that again. And I also feel that when you have a manager who is in charge of your particular area when they tell you something you are supposed to be able to believe that that is what will happen and if they get in trouble for it they will turn around and lie because they are afraid of their Superior no backbone I feel they lost many very talented people who have all moved on and been much more successful.
bad,"no balance, they use you and then trash you. stress! stress! stress! you are only a number to them! meet their computer system is out of date and there is no order"
bad,The Dillard's store on hulen was an unsafe environment management attach you without verifying information. the management have there favorite people and they let take extra long lunch with paid and if you speak to upper management there is backlash from the managers they issue a name tag but they call ( hey you)
bad,You will dread every day that you have to work. On your off days you will be thinking about how you have to be at work again. If you need time off or changes in your schedule don't ask  IF you don't have a high SPH. The high pay isn't worth the stress.
bad,"Terrible place to work, if your a teenager it would probably be ok. The management is horrible THEY ARE NOT TRUE TO THERE WORD. Orientation was a joke, told it was a month training by one manager, then found out it was six and my class only did one session and was thrown to the floor. I learned more stuff from the regular employees. Because managers made no time for you, to get proper training. No commission, the sales targets set you up for failure. You dont have proper supplies to execute your job. Alot of negative energy. I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS JOB. Also they may start your pay at 13 an hour but after a year and your sales per hour are not up, the lower your pay to 10.50 or they just part ways with you all together. Worked there just a month, and it was a TOTAL waste of my time."
bad,sales goals are astronomical as well as needing to generate at least 3 credit card applications a month. they fire old part time employees just to hire new people at a higher rate of pay and full time.
bad,This company cares only if the money it makes through employees. It does not however care for the employees themselves and proves that by its high turn over rate and amount of customer and employee complains
bad,"Dillard's has no training nor advancement. The management be it on the sales floor or the departments, and even the"" store management"" are  absolutely horrible.  They have no concern about employees particularly people of color. The store in Frisco, Texas has a racist store manager and assistant manager.  If one possesses any amount of intelligence, do not go to work for retail stores like Dillard's! There is no career with a livable salary in retail stores unless you are in a management role. Namely, store management."
bad,"Dillard's has a trust your employee problem. The pay was low with no overtime to help. The only thing that matters at Dillard's is the very,very large sales goal they put on you every week, that gets bigger if you don't make it. Every one all over the country has talked about how they fire you if you don't make the sales goal and every one talks about shopping there and there is hardly any help. (I wonder why)?"
bad,I wish I could say this was a great company. After the owners hired the current HR person the whole company has seen a decline in business and workers. The turn over in employees is over the top due to this HR person.
bad,"If you like to constantly are reminded to sale, sale, sale and pre-sell, this is the place for you!  management does not keep their word on promotions and increases. If management is willing to lie, you don't stand a chance."
bad,"Only apply if you are desperate for a job. Starts at $13/hr, but this place is a hot mess. Slow mall traffic yet Management expect you to make your sale quota. Some of the employees have been here for years and they are the ones that cause drama. "
bad,It’s sad this company has been like this for years they don’t hire blacks so don’t even waste your dime applying especially in st.clair square it’s just like Victoria’s Secret they hate blacks
bad,The company does not care about you.  They would replace you in a heartbeat.  Dillards is the only thing that matters to them and they do not care about school or outside of work activities.  They require incredibly unrealistic sales goals and have very few customers to obtain the goal.  They did not understand the concept of online shopping.  Cold corporate environment.
bad,"Not a good place to work, there’s a lot of Gossip and the store manager does nothing because they’re so desperate for people. Peoples families get disrespected, management talks bad about sales associates. The pay is not worth being stressed out all the time."
bad,As an employee this place mentally and verbally bullied me and many others. Bullying you & punishing you whenever you do something they don't like. Way to personal in there and management takes advantage of their position. Depending on your race they will determine the relationship they will build with you either treat you as a royal or a peasant.
bad,Dillard's company values are lack-luster and it showed in their management. The place was a revolving door. New hires every week. Commission goals unrealistic.
bad,"Dillard's started out really fun I enjoyed going to work at first.  I learned to much so fast but within 3 months everything changed. I worked in the cosmetic department, the counter and the store sales goals was absolutely insane to reach. And that's all part of the plan. See if you cant meet your counter goals you're going to get a demotion. But they don't tell you that in the beginning. You're completely blindsided by  how nasty and mean the management is, you feel so judged and it's not a open door feeling."
bad,"Dillard's is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They have the most unprofessional managers I have ever seen and the rudest ones too. If you want to be stressed out due to unrealistic sale goals of a dying company as well as be disciplined for not having sales when there are no customers, as well as deal with the rudest managers who think they are actually better then you because they make 40k a year, then this job would be perfect for you."
bad,Working for Dillards is not always and pleasant experience. The older employees are left to do everything and the new hires are always part timers who are taught to only sale and that all that matters. They do nothing but hang around registers and sale leaving everything else up to older associates to do and therefore they end up in the whole with their sales evaluation. the more you do and work to keep up the more they give you to do and they work you and treat you like a work horse.
bad,I did not like this job. The pay was decent but I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there long term. The company isn't very organized and the management team needs to be improved.
bad,"typical day at work included morning meetings , opening registers keeping a smile on and making sure you sell as much as you can. I learned to keep track of my sales goal."
bad,"As a sales associate with quotas to fill you do stockwork,cleaning,everything. Store Managers have no respect for the employees. The policies and rules changes to suit present scenarios without seeing it on paper. Sales quotas are unreal. They do paycuts in a blink of an eye and raises are not offered. You have to fight for it. No career growth. Everything is inconsistent. For someone wanting a 2nd or part time work you won't find much flexibility here. The Store Manager and Asst Mgr don't support career growth unless they favor you. They often forget to pay PTO and Sick time and special/training hours. When this issue is addressed, no one wants to be accountable. Dillards is a family owned company therefore, they can make up rules as they go. These store managers do a lot of scare tactics that work on employees that do not know better. I'm not sure if the owners know what's going on because if they do it's really sad. There are very few department managers that are left in this location that are decent and educated. Totally different atmosphere in comparison to other retail stores."
bad,This is absolutely the worst place that I have ever had to work for they sent your SPH  too high for  you to make long days they work you most of the day sometimes you have to close and turn around and be there to open if you want to live do not work for this company they have outdated clothing and they don't have much for their associates they care more about their business and making that money
bad,Dictatorship. Every Man for themselves. Don't help you grow. Leadership is a up and down. Employees come and go like a revolving door. no structure. employment built on fear.
bad,"Working for Dillard's has been incredibly stressful and frustrating. How they run the sales portion, in my opinion, is extremely wrong for the employees."
bad,"I did like working at Dillards, i love a challenge, and I love to sell. Management was pretty good, but would not be there when you needed them. that always took a while. Other employees were not willing to help with things, but others were great as usual.."
bad,"Horrible Place to work. Highest turnover rate and worst treatment to employees. All about sales, your job is in jeopardy every three months for sales quota reviews!"
bad,"Horrible Place to work. Highest turnover rate and worst treatment to employees. All about sales, your job is in jeopardy every three months for sales quota reviews!"
bad,"Dillard’s is not a place that offers secure jobs! People were being fired constantly. Google  search Dillard’s rating, it will tell you everything you need to know!"
bad,Experience was good in my  be half but the managers really needs  reality  check how to treat the employees and work has a team member!! It was very hard to keep a smile on my face working there
bad,"will never ever work for dillards again, hires outside of company , no hr support, very rude to employees, offers lowest pay for make up artistry around."
bad,"It was an extremely competitive job, it was a cut throat job. even the managers were childish and fighting the employees for sales. We had a very unreasonable qota to meet daily"
bad,I would not recommend any one to work for this company. They don't value their employees. Plus  some of the employees will not do their  share of work.
bad,"Nothing was in order."
bad,"This was the most stuck up place I've ever worked at, they sit around and talk about every customer than comes in. not a comfortable environment to be in and not proper training"
bad,"Met some great people over the years working at Dillard's. I love to interact with different people and love customer service. It was great the first few months but as time went on it got very bad. The associates were so stressed out because the pressure of making sales was very high. Management would pressure associates to make sales, if numbers were not met you will get a pay cut until you are terminated. You can't just provide great service and do your job even if you are a harder worker because at the end of the day your quota is what they evaluate you on."
bad,First started out great then after the smoke cleared I noticed the inconsistencies within the company and or their management. It's almost like there manager just due to the pay. They really could care less about the associate. They just want results and you to meet or over exceed your numbers or given SPH. Went to managers with concern and questions and they were all laid out and addressed to direct manager as well upper management. They'll act as if they're concerned and care but deep down inside they could care less. Just get them they're numbers. Inconsistent and weird scheduling.
bad,"I have been working for 6 years in this company , but the management in the store I work in is very hectic and always very uneasy. I am very unhappy where I work and I am currently looking for another job. Management treat good only the people that are on management, but the rest of the associates are treated differently."
bad,"The management team was awful.  There was never team work, they always took your overtime from even though they asked you to stay over.  The overtime that they did give they broke it down in a way that it all was not overtime.  They are a rip off."
bad,"My bad review of my experience at Dillards comes down to my particular store manager. There was absolutely no communication from store manager to the department managers, the store was a wreck, and employees would be found in dressing rooms drinking or hooking up."
bad,"Poor management extremely cut throat environment perpetuated by top management.  Hard working and reliable employees were treated poorly by manager.  No sick days regardless of full time status. Worked twelve hours straight with only a twenty minute break, reprimanded for using restroom after six hours and no break."
bad,i worked in the shoe department at dillards and it was VERY competitive. i hated the experience. when you are in a commission based position you can not get overtime.
bad,The managers are over zealous and they judge and talk about people. The goals are insane and you are always struggling to maintain you pay level. The management was the worst part of working at Dillard’s - very unprofessional and they love to gossip.
bad,"Worse place for work they use they’re employees until they need them ,working at Dillard such a wasting time ,they care about nothing just sell sell sell and make goal"
bad,its okay to work there but once again bad management bring a stressful work environment. in life team work makes the dream work.if we stick together we bring a stronger foundation to the entire work place.
bad,"Unequivocally the most miserable experience of my professional career. From the first day I stepped onto the sales floor I was harassed in the worst way by both employees as well as management. Constant verbal confrontations and on a few occasions escalating into potential physical confrontations until they were tacifuly and diplomatically diffused by myself. Management consistently refused to address or resolve these issues. Instead in a stunning display of hypocrisy would twist the circumstances and place the blame on me. In conclusion, by far the most miserable group of people I have ever had the displeasure of being associated with. It was like walking through the valley of the shadow of death."
bad,Did not enjoy my stay at all. Upper management was unprofessional and treated minorities less than the rest. Unfair. Rude. No HR which made it difficult to address any problems that were going on.
bad,"Company and managers don't care about most employees, I personally have never heard one person I work with say something positive about working there."
bad,Upper management was rude and inappropriate at times. Praise for good work was hardly given. Workplace culture was pretty cutthroat. I didn't trust many people I worked with.
bad,"They do not respect the sales Associates nor to all managers know how to manage a team, they want you to be afraid of them. They don't work with your other PTjobs, don't get your schedule till the day before you need to work  and is a monthly schedule."
bad,"too many hours, low pay, very stressful. super competitive. co workers are rude to each other. zero job security. they're fire you for any reason with no warning. the worst part are the hours. working over 40 hours a week and not being able to leave until the WHOLE department store is clean. therefore if you scheduled till 9 they locked the doors and no one can leave until all is clean. there were days i couldn't leave the store till 11pm."
bad,"They try every underhanded way to cut your pay, When sales are not there, make you kill a sales day by making you do something that has to be redone next week, just let the associates sell merchandise, but instead the work climate is the same year after year. The employees, that have persevered are then sent packing."
bad,The store was cut throat managers had there favorites department managers were never on the floor they just hid in the offices store manager was an idiot
bad,"Poor management made this job unbearable."
bad,Worked there for 5 years loved what I did loved my customers loved my dept. bosses were great company itself & polices could be better & could cater better to there workers needs & wants
bad,I would not recommend this company. There is a great deal of favoritism and there is no rhyme or reason to how they promote. The pay is unfair for experience you may have.
bad,"Because it was difficult to hire and train associates I ended up working 7 days a week 12 hour days. Due to the pay structure associates did not want to complete tasks but stood at the register. They received merit increases by how much they sold."
bad,"We were given daily, weekly and monthly sales goals. If we were not able to reach or maintain these goals we were put on probation for 3 months with bi-weekly reviews. After the 3 month probation we would be reassessed and if we had still had not kept these sales goals we were ""let go"". It was an extremely cut throat enviroment."
bad,Very slow and boring job . The management really didn't know what they were doing always favorite other employees . You have no breaks and have to stand for hours with nothing to do this job was one of the worst and management didn't know how to talk to there employees personal.
bad,Dillard’s management are racist and micromanaged you all day about credit and sales numbers. Store manager & Assistant were rude and unable to manage. Do not recommend to anyone.
bad,Dillard does not care about their employees. After informing management I was given a terrible diagnosis from my Dr. I was let go after 10years. poor management and lack of customer service will put them out of business
bad,Huge employee turnover. This company is all about numbers and  sales. If you are not making sales don’t expect to stick around.  Really a company that has gone down. It works well as long as you have something else as the main job.
bad,I really wasn't cut out for this place. It was super stressfull and the scheduling always conflicted with school or they would change it with out telling you so you would miss work without realizing it.
bad,So yeah. I worked there in March 2017 started for a week. I was excited to work in the makeup dept. I left quickly due to finding many issues. First they told us just dress professionally so ok I bought so many new clothes. We get told the next day oh well the makeup is the only one who has to wear all back and black flats or heels and they can’t be too casual. So that I had to return everything. You have to wear makeup everyday that’s not an option. And they only give breaks to employees working 8 hours or more. Even if you are on your feet all day. I had sores every night. Then they broke down your wage is determined by your sales. If you don’t make your sales every three months that’s it you get to minimum wage or fired. It was crazy. So yeah oh and they sign you to random beauty party’s to work off the clock. So yeah don’t work here. I found somewhere else. I thought it would be super fun just decorating makeup but no.
bad,"they make it sound like a great job with many advancements although the goals they set have so many rules that it is impossible yes impossible to reach them.  the quota standards are raised every three months and then a year making it impossible yes again impossible to make the quota of sales.  once quota's are not made good employees are fired yet they will keep around no call no show and proved thieving employees. "
bad,Terrible place to work. Management is ridiculous. Customers are even worse. If you stay too long they want you out. They have paid vacation and cool benefits but the management is like I mentioned ridiculous. They're never satisfied. The more you sell the more they still want you to sell.
bad,The store managers don't help with a stressful work place and constantly tell you not to trust co-workers and put associates against each other all they time. Shares your personal info with fellow co-workers.
bad,"The store manager was horrible, never would say that about anyone but, as soon as Dillards at the Domain hired Britney things came crumbling to the ground. People that have worked for Dillard's for over 8 years and over  were quitting due to poor management. Some of Britneys flaws were never spoke to the sales associates, she was very rude, didnt care about anyone in the store or anyone on her team. She picked favorites and hired people and tells them lies by telling them, she will work with their schedule and refused to do so.  I would recommend working at Dillards before she came. But now... its not worth the stress."
bad,"There is no job security here. the month your not doing so good in sales your being threaten with your pay being lowered, or even terminated. its very stressful and competitive."
bad,"Its not very fun to work at. The dllards here is ery full of mess and the manager dont really do a lot of work they are partially the mess keepers, Really needs to be structured"
bad,Its typically very slow not any volume during the week. The Clinique counter is the busiest in the Cosmetics department. Unfair management and constant micromanagement. Mainly employed by older employees most younger people don't stay long. Hardest part of the job is getting people to apply for credit cards considering Dillard's only has the Credit option available. Most enjoyable part of job was lunch or meeting new customers.
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE! New management is terrible. They are not considerate about you. They give you terrible hours. They play favoritism with certain employees.
bad,This is the worst place to work. Management encourages cut throat behavior. Will give you raises if you meet there high sales quota but they will cut your hours weekly. Will never want to return. Perks are you get free stuff if you work in cosmetics dept.
bad,There was little to no training for this position. There are many different types of platforms that are used in Dillard's. Each department trains their own assistants and each department and buyer has different expectations for their employees that are not specifically laid out.
bad,"A Typical work day for a sale associate, working diligent in keeping your department area clean. I learned how to gain customers trust when dealing with their credit card information. There was a lot of favoritism amongst management. Workplace culture, is a work in progress. The hardest part of the job was the constant standing my your feet throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers, knowing your customers needs, and keeping the customers happy while achieving good customers services."
bad,I can not say that this is a good company to work with.  No matter how good your performance is they are all about the money and sales.  If you can't give them there bottom line they will not keep you as an employee or promote you to full time.  Once you have met your goal they will keep making a bigger one they really don't care about anything or anyone just how much they  can make.  Great clothing and quality but overall the company cares for themselves.
bad,Do not recommend working at Dillard's. Management has lack of communication. Quota is extremely high and is hard to meet. You won't enjoy any vacation with family
bad,"poor management, all number games with her. working there is HORRIBLE NIGHT MARE.  Sales quota...if you dont sale $200/hr you get pay cut.  Dillards causes unneccesary dramas between sales associatiates because every associates have quota to meet..."
bad,I was discriminated against and I always felt like I was being treated unfair. The employees gossip like they are in high school. I would never go back to work there.
bad,"Management did not listen to the time request off I previously asked for. Given all closing shifts and one opening shift even though I have open availability. Slow paced environment, no chance for progressive growth."
bad,Dillards sets each and every employee up for failure. They lure them in with a decent wage not telling them they will be given an unreasonable quota to make in order to keep that salary. If they can not which is quite common they give them a pay cut. It also sets up animosity between co-workers to get sales before the other. It's a horrible and stressful enviorment.
bad,The hours are awful and it is a very rude and demanding environment. The management  is pitiful and I would never recommend anyone to work at Dillard's.
bad,I really did not like working at Dillards. The management was poor and it was a very cut-throat environment. I felt as though they did not care for there employees and turnover was a problem.
bad,"money hungry you make phone calls to customers for  events,   almost every week.  counters are calling the same customer over again. they don't care if you have a family life"
bad,Work mates were fine and great to work with but managers pressure sales to much. My manager called down to my counter every 15 minutes asking for updated sales numbers. Hated going to work everyday.
bad,"almost all departments are commissioned base and unless you sell a certain amount of that product your hourly wage will decrease. if you chose to apply there, go for the makeup and perfume positions"
bad,The management is awful. The mangment won't try to help with any issues. They cause the issues. If you don't make your unrealistic quota you get fired
bad,"Non-productive and not a fun place to work. "
bad,Dillards has Unrealistic quotas to meet per every work shift. That is all company cares about making numbers. If you do not produce the numbers/quota you are bound for termination.
bad,"We have very poor management. The hours are horrible and they have quota system that make a very stressful place to work. Upper management has made it very clear that we are nothing but, numbers to them and they care nothing about there employees. We also can't take our vacations when we like to. With the exception of Holidays, because we know we can't take vacation during the Holidays."
bad,They harass you about everything. The do not appreciate anything you do. They fire people for no reason.  If you have issues with your badge they will not correct it in the computer.
bad,Area manager regularly played favorites with sales personnel in which she tried to get others to make sales on their behalf thereby robbing others of lucrative sales.  When I tried to address this with the store manager I was reprimanded.
bad,I've never hated a job more. Very low pay and benefits. Horrible work hours. The company cares nothing about the employees. The entire company has a very high turn over rate.
bad,"This was absolutely the worst work place experience I have ever had. Everyone fights over sales, the managers do nothing about competition and if you have an issue you're on your own. Your job is not secure, and if you don't open enough credit cards in a month they crack down on you for it and eventually terminate you"
bad,"the work culture is vicious, you are constantly pressured to push credit card applications and they will have you do ""classes"" at 8 am weekly if you arent able to get an application. Associates that have been there for years are petrified to lose their jobs over a single bad sales week, regardless of the stores traffic."
bad,Comission based and competition is high especially since it isnt busy everyday. Discount is great. Customers are rude.Management is ok. Overall not too bad no too good.
bad,I had a miserable experience working for Dillards. Only the lazy got raises. It was encouraged that you cleaned up after those that sold so they could sell more. Thosed that cleaned lost their pay then their jobs.
bad,In my opinion it could have been a much better work environment. managers were obviously there for the check and that is it. Not much help from higher managment. But it is a paying job.
bad,I do not recommend working at Dillards Hill Country Galleria!!!! the managers have no idea what they are doing and they expect you to make sales that are unrealistic and you can get pay deductions for it.
bad,Worse management.  No orientation or training.  I was entitled to certain benefits as a part timer and I was never informed that I was.  HR was no help either.  Hourly goals are too high for current retail environment.  Company does no advertising to bring in business.  The quality of associates the company hires is pitiful.  Horrible environment to work in.
bad,Sales environment/competetive/not paid enough for what you deal with. management is disorganized. they don't care about your schedule. they think this job should be the most important thing in your life.
bad,"Management sucked, and unless your cut throat you wont make it working here. Also other co-workers are very rude. Don't trust anyone while working here."
bad,"the management sucks. the goals are unattainable. hard to move up in company they do not care about employees. very competitive,  hard to get a raise."
bad,"I could not tell you a good thing about working her, every sales associate is either incredibly lazy or cut throat.  The managers are for some reason glorified.  The hours are horrible and the pay wasn't even worth the headache."
bad,"Dillard's has the potential to pay well but does not treat their employees well. Management talks to you anyway. You are set up to fail, the turn over is high because they pit employees against each other to make sales goals. Team work does not exist."
bad,"Working any Dillards was such a disappointment. The manager was very unprofessional and frequently gossiped about and intimidated her employees on a daily basis. It was a very uncomfortable place to work, but could easily be a very fun job given the right manager."
bad,Well you asked the question! the branched manager they fired along with other office personal to included someone that had been there 20 plus years. Would I recommend Dillard's as a work place. NO!!!!!!!!!
bad,I been there for almost 6yrs and its has no way to move up. They treat there employees like nobodys. It like working in dictatorship.  Like I said before  is a dead in job really.    But you have to work and keep looking till you find a better way.
bad,Very hard place to work. Constantly competing for sales. They only care about sales quota. You can be a very experienced  sales person with great work ethic. Never call out or be late to work. Do everything asked of you and still not enough if you don't hit your sales goal. Which is hard to reach with no customers in the store.. Managers have no respect for there employees. Would never recomend this place of business to anyone if I like them.lol. Maybe if your a used car salesman this place may work for you.
bad,The management in this location were terrible to work for. I feel it was a waste of my time to have even taken the offer in the first place. I left a solid job to move to this position and now I fully regret my choice.
bad,"Management is completely unengaged to what's happening on the sales floor.  They create unrealistic sales goals, without consideration of popularity of area, seasonal sales trends, etc. Your sales per hour always remains the same. You are forced to resign no matter how hard you work or how well customers like you, the sph is all they look at. I was in an area with a huge turnover rate? That should have been my first clue to Run! The work load was incredible, with new product lines coming in constantly. I had the largest area to maintain, but most difficult to achieve the extremely high sph required by mgmt. I loved helping the customer, going the extra mile for them. Sometimes it ended in a big sale, sometimes not, but always my client walked away happy. Dillards didn't care about any of that, only the sph.  If your review period happens to be during the slow time of year, then too bad for you, there's no exceptions made. SPH is always high. Statistically, this was completely unreasonable. The high goals caused animosity among the sales associates. Very Negative atmosphere!"
bad,"The management is trained to do nothing and ignore any and all supervision responsibilities, they are bias and not team players or encourage or motivate their employees. In fact, they are the reason there is not team work. The management is lazy and could care less about their employees as well as the owners. Management will always side with the Supervisors in any situation. Employers are encouraged to be competitive against each other for sales, so there are many employee discrepancies on the sales floor to make a quota in order to keep their job, increase their pay, or pay will be dropped."
bad,"Working at Dillard's is very stressful. If you have kids at all, pets who are like kids to you, family, or if you even get sick, the job is not for you. You have to be on your ""death bed"" as I've been told if you want to call in."
bad,Management was too driven on numbers and meeting department quota. Management was more concerned with quotas than with their people. Difficult to advance. They were always cutting people's hours and salary.
bad,I'd like to start working here I have no problem lifting heavy things I'll always be on time I hope to start working there I think it be a good place to start
bad,I hated working here because they were an awful representation of a company that should provide excellent customer service and service for their employees. They were unjust and treated their employees terribly. They are rated the third worst company to work for and now I know why.
bad,"Work day isn't bad.  However, no one is EVER trusted.  All staff is watched and spied on all hours of every day.  One of the store senior management has the job of firing people - that is there sole job!"
bad,Management is unfair and employees are required to meet unrealistic expectations. Sales goals are insane and impossible to reach. Extremely competitive employees.
bad,OMG! this multi billion dollar company won't even supply the materials needed to help you keep them making money!  I would never work or shop in their stores again!
bad,Not a good company to work for if you are looking for advancement. People of color are looked over quite often for upper positions within. Many have been overlooked for regardless of qualitications
bad,A typical day was stressful and very hard. I learned a lot though. I was treated awful along with all other employees by management. Everything was hard. The only enjoyable part was meeting new people. I never recieved credit for my hard work or was told good job. Instead they would eat me up and spit me out. Worst place to work for.!
bad,The managers are rude and only care about sales. If you don't sale $1500 in a day they will fire you. Employees will steal your sales to keep their job.
bad,I would under no circumstances suggest working at dillards. The management was awful and they intentionally reprimanded me for menial and unfair things. Never work for this awful company.
bad,They flood the sales floor preventing you from really ever making commission. Management shows favoritism. People are promoted but aren't trained for their new positions. The training classes/ information taught seemed to vary among new associates.
bad,"They called me in on my graduation day that i already had requested off..  The managers do not care if your are a student, Have children, or called in due to a family emergency."
bad,"To start, no HR department.  Very poor leadership.  There was no direction, only to make the company money.  Very reactive, no proactive opportunities."
bad,"They have no regard for the fact that sales goals are completely ridiculous compared to the available people to sell to.  I was given a goal of $500 per hour-after the Christmas holidays, mind you, and there were no more than four customers  during my whole shift. The entire department made $60 that night.  How am I supposed to make $500 per hour?!  Ridiculous."
bad,"Commissioned shoe sales is designed to underpay employees. The shoe department is staffed with too many people such that the entire department's sales volume is not  enough to cover  the commission of all sales associates. "
bad,"Long hours/shifts, no opportunity for advancement. quotas were not realistic and obtainable, management was unprofessional and corrupt, I hated working there!"
bad,"I used to work in beauty department. if it wasn't for my co-workers I wouldn't make it. there was no on hand proper  training,some managers are not manager material. specifically my beauty department manager. she has no respect nor understanding for her teammate.she dictate how employees complete task, question employee's judgments,frequently ask for updates, and check in incessantly ."
bad,"Unless you was extremely liked by the entire management team, then there was no way you would be getting a promotion or a raise. Seniority in the employees meant nothing compared to if they liked the person."
bad,The co workers were sometimes nice when they weren't competing for sales. I hated that if you werent making goal they would definetly fire you without hesitation.
bad,"Team members are expected to stand all day with only a one hour break for lunch.  Management never offers praise - always negative feedback.  Goals are excessive and if they are not met, Dllards will cut your pay.  There is absolutely no team work.  Associates compete for sales and no one can be trusted."
bad,"Dillard's has an outrageous turnover rate, poor management quality, and unrealistic expectations from their associates. It is listed on Forbe's top 10 worst companies to work at for a reason."
bad,Terrible company to work for.  Benefits did not exist and management is severely lacking.  Employees never treated kindly or fairly.  Would never recommend.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"This job was very discrimination "
bad,"There was little to no room for advancement, management cared little about development of staff and the department numbers. Schedule would be changed without prior notice making it a hassle to balance life and work. Toxic work environment due to unhappy employees."
bad,"horrible managers no work life balance , slave drivers . not enough pay for the hard work. Dont waist your time . seriously don't just don't run........."
bad,Assisting associates with balancing the drawers.  Talking to customers concerning complaints.  No organization other than management able to change schedules
bad,Working for Dillard's was definitely a learning experience something that I could have underneath my belt in the workforce.
bad,This job was created to make sales associates hate one another. You have to constantly harass customers to make them purchase their items from you. The expectations from the job are unrealistic. Customers do not understand why sales associates are constantly insisting on assisting them. It is because  of the hourly goal. The company threatens to fire the associate if quotas aren't meet. Every day is a nightmare. Unsure when your last day will be. The job is entirely too stressful.
bad,"Ambiente de trabajo estresante, poca capacidad gerencial y respeto en el manejo de empleados,"
bad,"As a sales associate we are expected to meet sales per hour, hard too do when sales are down, they don't understand you cannot sell when people aren't shopping.  Very disrespectful"
bad,Dillards requires unrealistic sales goals with horrible coaching. I never once found an effective management team working for this company in multiple locations. The company would rather terminate employees due to personal vendetta rather than help coach people with potential. I was able to succeed in multiple positions but they work you very hard. I was on salary and required to work sometimes six days a week which ended up being less than minimum wage. I would never recommend working for this company despite leaving on very good terms with Dillard's.
bad,"The manager there is very rude, she doesn't care about your thought or feelings. All she cares about is herself. She seems like a miserable person and so she treats everyone like they are nothing."
bad,"I worked for a company that where you are better at your job, the less rewarding it is. False promises of promotions, your raise is based on the economy. So, if someone returned an item, you would be hurt in the end"
bad,Terrible employee and customer appreciation. They let employees know how disposable they are and employees treat the customers with poor customer service experiences
bad,"Sales people are given unmanageable goals,  with no sort of support from management, poor advertising which inhibits a consistent bases of customers. The Sales people are all set against one another, within departments and between departments, causing literal fights between sales people over customers, out of fear of job security, as the goals are unrealistic to obtain. Poor customer service was generally provided as the main goal was to fight off other sales people who are interfering with the customer you are trying to work for."
bad,This company is all about their company and customers.  The most enjoyable part about working for this company is the pay.
bad,"No real training, poorly organize management team. If there were issue that need to address you will not give any notice or writing. And yes, you will get let go without any warning. Very unprofessional company. I had been with a world wide company for many years and they do not handle issues without warning. And I did not do anything against company rules and regulations."
bad,It was nice to help people make great fashion decisions and help them for a lot of occasions they had to prepare for. People seemed to be enthused with my work style.
bad,"they do not believe in customer service, just make a sale. they do not have any training but as soon as your on the floor they have a goal for you to achieve."
bad,this company is not   with the times. I felt like i was working in a 1980's movie. this is not ideal for a fashion expert. htey were not open to new ideas and very big on values .
bad,This company isn't ever concerned about the employee or their family. The don't care if you are sick or have surgery. You are to work no matter what.
bad,"No help from upper mgmt. unreasonable goals, low pay bad hours"
bad,"horrible place to work, management showed favoritism."
bad,"No real training, expected to sell more than what department makes on most days, must meet sales quota or you get pay cut first time, second time you get fired."
bad,"Lack of customers due to nearby competition w/outlet malls. Lack of job security."
bad,They would work you like a slave for very little incentive. Very little communication. Everyone fighting to meet quota.
bad,"They rally don,t care about the worker and you are completely disposable to them. The sales goals they have are impossible to meet and the other workers will do everything to steal your sales."
bad,"No advancement, low pay, management issues. goal threats"
bad,"Impossible to meet sales quotas.  Too many sales reps on floor.  Ungodly hours during the holidays."
bad,"they do not work with you and your schedule. you arent treated right if your not friends with someone that is management or depending on your race. i know for a fact that they will hire someone with no experience and pay them more than someone with experience based off of race and who you know. this company does not care if you are sick or having issues outside of work, they will threaten to fire you every step of the way with or without a doctors note. they have also promised someone that there job was secure and then fired her within the next week. your hours are long and they really dont like you to ask for time off, for anything."
bad,Ever couple of years the store changes its managers but there was one that has managed to stay there for so long. He is the store manager and extremely rude and has no people skills. I am not sure why he has his job.
bad,Not considerated of the employees at all.Treat them like trash. Don't treat the employees right. empolyees frusing about helping guest and doing it in front of the guest.Not good at all.
bad,"DONT DO IT"
bad,I hate it there. Management is rude and pushy and they are always trying to fire someone. tried to get away for so long but needed to pay my bills.
bad,Dillard's Inc is a joke. It feels like they work against you and make it very hard for you to be successful there. I started as a store secretary and transferred to a sales associate due to being at topped pay at $12 as the secretary. RIDICULOUS students should look into part time there. Other than that this is no place for people with families.
bad,clock in get to you satation where you did make up you had to make a quota monthly during the holidays it was mre you had to walk to people and try and get them to come try s they would maybe buy what you were saling then when it was time for gift you h would have to call them and let them know it was gift time
bad,They overlook the good deeds and if you don't make your quota you get a 30 day notice. During the holidays they really work you hard and never give you praise or good deeds.
bad,"This company is by far the worst I have ever worked for in my life. I have learned what not to do through Dillard's. Management was unbearable, but not on a department level. I saw many store and assistant store managers come and go and not one of them was able to treat their employees like they are supposed to be treated (in a mature and professional manner). There is a lot of manipulative tactics used with this company. Too much politics. The only thing enjoyable about working for them was the people that I met both with whom I worked and for those that came in the store as customers."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about you, work here. In the bathroom stall crying 90% of the day because no one cares or listens to me.  The job I'm doing is constantly doing other peoples jobs or being put in other departments due to short staffing.  I can't wait to get a different job so I can quit."
bad,"Worst job in America look it up dillards was #3 for years that should tell you something,  they go through staff like hot cakes,  they threaten your job daily with sph or having to sign some paper work for a new rule they made up, management changes their mind and lie all the time. "
bad,"I've had several bad experiences working for this company: "
bad,"Sales associates are expected to maintain a high sales per hour, SPH.  If their sales do not support the associate's pay of $12 per hour, the sales associate is terminated."
bad,"There was rats, other rodents and insects in the break room and around the store. Clearance manager and Assistant Manager unprofessional with the worse attitude and the slickest mouth. I do not know what was worse Compensation or the unbelievable hours that were posted, most employees thought the store was closing down. Never ate at the potlucks only brought more rats and roaches. The sink was sometimes covered in rat poo. Former co-worker wanted to bring the news to the store undercover to expose this horrible excuse for a job. smh. -Nique"
bad,"I worked in two departments lingerie and accessories. The pay is the best rate for retail. The management sets your daily goals high, and earning that quota is a very good feeling."
bad,"When I first started with the company I loved working there.  The atmosphere was fun and my co-workers and clients were a delight to work with.  When new store management came in, the atmosphere was very stressful.  They put a lot of pressure on associates to make sales and give pay cuts or lay-offs if you don't meet the unrealistic sales goals.  They also gave no support to help achieve the goals.  It became a very negative environment to work in.  There was a lot of favoritism, i.e. one person was allowed to wear whatever they wanted but someone else would be sent home for wearing that same thing.  It felt like I was back in high school because of the backstabbing and the cliques that were formed within the new management team.  I learned a lot about the merchandise and miss my clients and being able to help them, but feel less stressed and a lot happier."
bad,"Assisting customers, On the job is really difficult. It's hard to please management. Co-workers are great. The hardest part is maintaining a high quota without any customers. The most enjoyable part is helping customers."
bad,"This company is solely focused on their bottom line and employees are just that employees, they don't care about you life outside of the job everything you do is to benefit them and the company only"
bad,horrible place to work take advantage of good employees and let bad employees do as they please. double standards and shown and seen daily with this company
bad,"I was laid off from this company no fault of my own. I had over 500 customers in my computer files within a year of employment.  I performed my job above requirements.  They brought in part time employees @ 12 hrs per week to take sales away from full time employees.  They have four or five favorite employees who they continually retain using unethical management tacticts. I would enter into my computer my customers only to find the next time I would look them up to be erased from the system. It was a very aggravating job- with poor management.  It was a revolving door of employees, over 60 in length of time I was there including 4 doc managers, and womens apparel manager who had been there for 14 years. I was the associate the customers would always find to wait on them when others were not in their departments, and yet I still was let go.  My customer sales and customer service was always complemented, even my online sales and online application submittals."
bad,"Dillard's is the worst employer I worked for. They treat their hardworking employee's like crab. They bring in their own people for management, and as long as you are making them money you can do what ever you want. Dillard's executives are raciest, really raciest! toward all minorities. I can only speak from experience and not what I heard, the raciest comments used and said, completely hurt and disrespect me. Please think twice about at Dillard's, let this be your last resort.....If you are desperate for a job then work on their Dock. Oh"
bad,"A typical day at Dillard's is centered around sales. Retail sales in a department store setting is an ever changing landscape, but Dillard's doesn't seem to ever change. There is a constant flow of markdowns and new inventory. The systems for completing these are very antiquated. In addition, the pay scale is very convoluted. It works on a Sales Per Hour system, which calculates your sales based on when you are clocked in. This system creates a lot of animosity amongst employees and customers. This SPH system is the only way that sales people are reviewed and pay cuts and terminations result from not meeting these goals."
bad,Absolute worst place I have ever worked for. You are fighting people for numbers which are impossible when there aren't people there to buy.  They say its about your numbers but will keep and hire people full time when they do not meet there quota. Management are very rude and the store manager talks down to everyone. I have worked at a lot of top level jobs and this being a very bottom level job and ive never been treated so poorly until working at Dillards
bad,THIS WAS LITERALLY THE WORST JOB I HAVE EVER WORKED AT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The compensation is not nearly worth all the drama you have to go through working for this company. I wouldnt even spend my money there ever again.
bad,"If you plan on a temporary position this would be ideal, not many employees stay with this company for long, there is really no reason to. Horrible management."
bad,"A typical day at Dillard's would be one word: chaos. I was on the management team and it was practically a joke. I would be expected to come in on my days off to work at least for an hour or two, which was something I was not going to do constantly. There were so many safety concerns in the stockrooms and around the store that I am certain they will be sued soon because of someone getting seriously hurt. "
bad,"•	Sales and Customer Service"
bad,do not work there because the headache you would have to endure is not worth it.  The experience i personally did not like the way Dillard
bad,"Very poorly managed. No hours, No advancements, Not very rewarding"
bad,"Nearly impossible to make the goals they set for you everyday. When a customer returns an item they subtract from your goal that day. They cut your pay 10% every 6 weeks. When they fire you, they will personally walk you out through the front of the store. Employees hide sale items for themselves, management does nothing."
bad,Dillard's hired about 60 new people including 6 upper management types during the time that I worked there. They set unrealistic expectations on employees whom they offer little to no training to - basically they set people up for failure so no one succeeds and there is constantly a need to hire new people. If you're full time you can expect to give up your personal life for a 6 day work week - 7 days during the holidays. Management is there merely as a figurehead and in no way as support for the constantly changing staff.
bad,"Horrible place to work, do not go to this place unless it is your VERY LAST option I have been in different positions at this place and worked at different locations."
bad,"If you are doing your job or not, they will question if you are doing your job. If your sales are low they will let you go unless they want to keep you. If you are meeting your sales goals(even surpassing them) and they do not want you there, they will let you go.  You are always in competition with your co-workers so there is always that love/hate relationship. They have a return policy but, most customers know if they cause a scene a manager will be called and override the policy. I would say that pretty much sums up the worst part of the job. And the  best part of the job is the customers!"
bad,"If you look it up on the internet, Dillards is one of the top 10 worse companies to work for. In my work environment, I like to work with friendly, social and hard working employees. This is just simply not the place for that at all! I loved what I did while working there, but the surrounding was just toxic."
bad,"The job itself was okay but when you cant trust your co-workers because they are violating HIPPA laws and your manager wont do anything about it, its time to leave."
bad,"Greet and welcome guests and build relationships"
bad,"At Dillard's I was a full time sales associate . I was one of the top performers within the company. typically I would keep my overall department clean and up to date while also assisting customers while they shopped. I learned hard work, floor plans, how to deal with rowdy rumbustious customers and how to fully operate a cash wrap. although the company paid great the atmosphere and management was stressful and unfriendly to employees. Some of my co-workers became friends, while others remained associates. The main goal was to be able to work and function together, as we did well. The hardest part of the job was multi tasking. There were many tasks that needed to be conquered by the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part of the would have to be the weekly pay and getting to meet new people on a daily basis."
bad,Pay sucks and so do the hours its a great job for a student not if you are trying to make a livieing you will starve
bad,"The money is great at first but the management team is awful, the quota you have to meet daily without commission. But Great Customer experienced was a lesson learned!"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of trying not kill my co workers, my customers and myself.  In all seriousness, it's the unimaginably unprofessional management and the dreaded ""sales per hour"" that make this job utterly miserable.  It was also boring and mundane.  Having worked at Sephora where I had a blast all day (while raking in sales) it was hard for me to just stand there all day and try to convince old ladies to buy $180 night cream.  The only, and I mean ONLY thing that was good about Dillard's was that we didn't have to work such crazy holiday hours which is almost unheard of these days in retail.  But that's not enough to make we want to step foot in there again.  Stay away..stay far away people!"
bad,A typical day at work is staying busy and meeting very interesting people. I have learned how to deal with the public on a one-on-one basis. The management is very lacking though and not very respectful to their employees. I enjoy my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is making each and every customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some great people.
bad,"Always had straightening and cleaning to do if we weren't busy"
bad,"I loved working with the customers and the employees.  I still after 3 years go into the store to visit my friends who still work there.  I understand the store is under new management, and the store is ran better. I made the mistake of not keeping up with my pay rate and it cost me."
bad,While working at Dillard's your required to sell a certain amount per hour is very difficult and if you don't meet hourly sell goals they terminate you that's ridiculous.
bad,Most horrible experience I've ever had with any company and I have been in the work force for more than 35 years.
bad,"Constant pressure to meet sales goals, with no help from management.  Fired or reduced to part time if goals aren't met. "
bad,"Horrible work/life balance. Dillard's will work you to death during the holidays, sometimes with 13 days in a row without a day off. "
bad,Its hard work and youre under paid for the stress and mess you have to go through with the clients and staff and the management needs to be changed.
bad,"Opening and closing of the store, Secured funds, Inventory, Price adjustment, Credit verifications, Direct sales, inventory, Customer service, Data entry. "
bad,"Very unprofessional place of business!"
bad,"A typical day is to chase a sale from a customer."
bad,Employees are expected to meet unreasonable sales quotas.
bad,I loved what I did there helping others find what they wanted to their liking but management was rude unprofessional and coming to work everyday was stressful
bad,Working here was a waste of time. I learned that even with a college degree there is no job security. The sales goals were unrealistic for the area. Besides the store manager the management was not the best. I have seen a member of management get away with sexual harassment and feel like I lost my job for reporting it. The co workers were friendly but could not be trusted. The only good thing about the job was getting to dress nice and the pay.
bad,"I used to love blockbuster until the higher ups messed up the business, theres no way they can compete with the likes of redbox and netfix"
bad,"I got let go yesterday from Dillard's for not making my sales per hour. I worked their part-time nights and weekends, starting at 20-25 hours per week, then after the holidays, they dropped my hours down to about 10 hours. The store has been dead so I have not had much sales. I have worked there for almost 6 months, never late, never missed a day, worked hard, but it didn't matter. They want you to sell, sell, and open credits for them. And if you don't at your six month review, they fire you without warning."
bad,"My typical day begins at 9;45 which starts with counting the register down for the day, we are called into a pep talk by management, to pump us for that particular day, we assist the customers with purchases and ordering  their merchandise online, we assist with directions to different areas of the job, I've learned to appreciate the elderly and respect myself, I've learned to encourage myself, because everyday you dont find that, Our management staff is exceptional, the co-workers are joyful to a degree, the atmosphere is enjoyable, the hardest part of my job is standing up for 8 to 9 hours aday. my most enjoyable part of my day is when I can find everything that my customer has to have. I get enjoyment when they are happy and relieved."
bad,"Dillard's is very big on sales goals and SPH. They have intricate programs to track each and every sale you make, and then proceed to tell you what you didn't do vs what you did. A very negative vibe is the running feeling throughout the store. Sales goals are difficult to attain in some departments, and the formula for reaching them is very defeating. "
bad,"Work was slow at the beginning of the week,which I learned how to be patience,my coworkers were regular working people and the hardest part of the job was making your sales quota and I don't think there were a enjoyable day plus they lied to me I was told I was making 10.00 hr"
bad,"You have to meet a quota and if you don't meet your quota after the first 6 months you take a pay cut and after 9 months they fire you. With the recession no one is buying like they were before so its hard to meet your quota. If the customer returns something its goes against you. Co-workers are catty and fight to get sales and steal sales from other associates."
bad,"As a salaried manager, you are scheduled to work 40 hours a week with 2 days off, but you are expected to stay extra and come in on your days off without additional pay.  If you need to take time off or just a day off, you are required to come in and make it up or they will take it from your vacation.  They don't pay you when you work extra, but they doc your pay if you don't work your schedule.  The managment team and the directors do not care about people or their home life and situations.  They also expect part time associates to treat this as their full time job, with out benefits or flexiblity.  We had an ice storm, and the entire mall shut down at 5:00pm, but Dillards still stayed open to 10:00pm.  Making the associates risk theiry wellbeing in driving home at dark in ice.  Holiday season we terrible.  You were scheduled 6 day work weeks, with 10 hour shifts, I guess they thought we didn't have family or shopping that we needed to do as well.  There wasn't anything enjoyable about the job other than I loved my associates and wanted to be there for them because I knew that no one else in the company was."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is the environment. As well as the different age groups.
bad,"Low pay, boring sitting back and watching cameras all day. Management was bad."
bad,Retail work is not by strong suit.  I work better with a regular schedule.  There was alot of time that there were no customers and found myself bored and going no where.
bad,"worse job experience, could not meet there standards, no employ has been there over a year. i did not learn anything, felt like i was at a standstill everyday. had no business and management was awful and not professional."
bad,Management does not care if employees bend the rules or even harass other employees as long as they make their quota every month.
bad,A friendly place to work where the associates work hard and enjoyed what they where doing. A family oriented atmosphere.
bad,"Unloading and loading trucks, and assisting customers on the sales floor"
bad,"only interested in your Sales per Hour and if you do not make them, whether their are not any customers or not, you will be fired."
bad,"Unreasnoble demands put upon the employee for Company goals, No growth opportunities.  It was however very enjoyable working with the public."
bad,"You have no face.  You are treated like a chess piece being moved all over the board.  Even though you meet all sales goals, bring up sales in your department, have customers writing letters about you, calling in about your excellent customer service etc. you have no face.  Have never worked for such a company ....EVER.  Mentally draining and so unprofessional."
bad,no balance between work and life. Worked too many hours lost too many days off for visits
bad,"Dillard's teaches hard working ethics. That can be a good thing, however it is not a fun place to work because of the store manager. I love my visual job and always try to exceed my own goals and the companies goals. it is hard to stay positive for a company that is rated low on enjoyable places to work and then the management style is not up to date with our current age market of employees, so makes it hard when the company is on a more traditional selling page and the age groups shopping are not traditional shoppers anymore it not all about service to them its about fast new hot they have a picture of an item and want it, they aren't coming to be provided 5 star service that's just a bonus, that's if its efficient fast and with someone trendy and on their level. Generation Y is here!"
bad,A typical day of work was puttin clothes away in the correct area and trying to sell lots of items that Dillard's had in their inventory. Management pressured their workers to sell and promote Dillard's credit cards. If these sales goals were not made then a potiential pay cut was going to happen.
bad,"I sold $350,000 making Pacesetter in 2012, I made $19,000 that year not even ten percent of what I sold for them."
bad,"Print markdowns"
bad,"Well, since day one I could tell it was going be a bad place to work due to how things were managed. Things actually became worst when a new store manager took over. He was short with his word to his employees, cold hearted and unfair unless it was a pretty woman that brought revenue to the store or a good gentlemen sales associate. I worked on the dock, we were always asked to other peoples' work, miscellaneous assignments along with our own like housekeeping before the store opened and our main duty, unloading trucks. My co-workers and I saw vast numbers of employees come in late on a daily where as to which we started writing it down. There were ladies that worked in cosmetics, lady's shoes or men's dept. they were late all the time and never were fired- 3 women told me they were trying to get fired and they wouldn't do it... we were only allowed to be tardy 6 times each quarter but straight from there mouths, I was told by all, ''I've been late 35-45 times and another told me from working there 7 months, she had been late 74 times and was late 4 hours'', on different occasions but was never written up or fired. I helped break up a fight, yes, a fight between 2 young ladies during store hours between 2 women that worked for the Dillard's, never were written and both kept there jobs until they quit on their own merit. All in all- it's the worst place I have ever worked for as all who worked there agreed, even some of the ASM's that were forced by store manger to make."
bad,"did not have set schedules, would go 2 and 3 weeks w/o an off day. paycheck was short a couple times. "
bad,This is the first job that I worked in retail and I did not having to work on commission.  The values are not their for their  associate.  
bad,I will never work here again. The job was too stressful. Since the new store manager you have no way to know when you will lose your job. All around a horrible place to work. Don't ever accept a job there.
bad,"I would never work for this company, nor would I recommend that anyone work for this company. There is a reason they have been voted one of the worst companies to work for."
bad,"When you work commission sales, at Dillard's, it is ""every man, woman"" for themselves. The long time employees say they will help you and they share sales but this is not so. Long time employees get to pick their schedules and they basically run the womens' shoe department. They will take your sales, if you walk away and let the customer browse the shoe department, turn around and they are on them. It does not matter if you have worked with that customer for 20 minutes. It could be a team environment, if the manager actually managed the department, instead of letting the two (women) run it for him. I have never worked anywhere with this type of management style. It does not harbor a team environment, causes resentments, and lots of ""call ins"", with a who cares attitude, towards the product, the customers and the store itself."
bad,"A typical day at work kind of busy, I've learned to give the customers the best customer service ever that's the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest is trying to keep both eyes on everyone when it's busy to make sure everyone has been assisted. My co-workers are very easy to get along with and my manager she's great!"
bad,"I have never hated anything as much as I hated this job. All the young people looked for another job at every opportunity. I feel as if only older people stayed for fear of not being able to get employed else where. They do not promote from within regardless of your education or experience. They would rather hire a fresh out of college person to manage you with no retail experience versus promoting a current employee. You are not treated as a person , you are only seen as a number. All they care about is sales. It does not matter about anything else, customer service or putting away stock Only about what you sale. You have a sale goal that you must maintain, if you do not do so you will get fired. Unless they are having one of their rare sales toward the end of the month when you get a percentage off of clearance merchandise the stores are a ghost town. The sales goals doesn't reflect the fact that they do not have constanct flow of customers. The management is horrible and they talk to you like a child when most of the time you are older than then. I seriously could go on and on about this place , if you must work there know it is not a place for a career work there and continue looking for something else. Oh yes Dillard's was voted the #2 worst place to work for in aug 2012 I believe in the New York journal , the turn over rate is horrible from sales associates and managers and everything in between ."
bad,"Bad management. Unrealistic goals, Management micro managed, co-workers untrained,"
bad,"This was the worst corporate environment I've ever seen or heard of. Management was archaic and if you didn't like it, you could leave. Employees were treated as an unwanted necessity. Avoid working for this company. If you are a student, know this will be a short-term employment and it fits your school schedule, go for it. Otherwise, do not work for this Company."
bad,"All They care about is the bottom line, the numbers and do not care about their employees at all! Schedule causes you to have no life. Worst place I have ever work for. Dillards is going mostly to all part time workers to cut benefits. I will be loosing my insurance!!!"
bad,This is the worse job ever! If you don't make your monthly sales they write you up by the 3rd write up they fire you!
bad,Dillard's has terrible management skills. The whole Dillard family can't get along with each other and so they don't. When one member of the family does something the other one tries to do something different. What happens is it hurts the little guys in the process. They are a terrible place to work and I don't wish the experience I had on anybody.
bad,"The managers are HORRIBLE PEOPLE! Dillard's is the WORST place to work or, they have the HIGHEST turn over rate."
bad,BEWARE OF THIS EMPLOYER! (FASHION PLACE MALL)
bad,Stressfull. Your just a number there. Management was a joke. Dont care about customers or the employees they only care about the sales. Dillards is very selfish.
bad,"Management is poor. Very stressful job. They set a high SPH so you fail at making it. People who work there are not concerned with customer service, just making their goals for the day. If SPH is not met within a period of time you will have your pay cut or get fired."
bad,Absolutely the worst company I have ever worked for. I won't even shop there now.
bad,"There is no such thing as a typical work day. You have no job description, never know where you stand and when you try to talk about advancement they look at you like you have four heads. No such thing as confidentiality, no true HR and favortism is the only thing practiced in this company. I would never work for this company again no matter the circumstances in my life."
bad,"dillards is awful. there idea of a happy evnironment is demanding credit applications, demanding an unrealistic sales goal, putting as much pressure as possible to make coming to work daily a hassle."
bad,"Quick to fire you. Empolyees are not treated fairly. Managment is full of gossipers, you can't trust any of them to be professional. Work was ever appreciated. Expectations were unrealistic."
bad,"Very stressful, quotas too high, management is hard to please"
bad,"Terrible company! High sales goals, a lot of stress. Bad management and poor training support. Random lay offs and terminations for not making sales goals."
bad,"absolutely despised this job. talked down to, hours sucked, and horrible people."
bad,Sold merchandise to retail customers . Maintained sales floor for neatness. Responded to sales goal effectively.
bad,"What a dump! Poor management, empty store, poor moral, and a crooked and disgusting company ethic!"
bad,They do not appreciate anyone that works there. They take advantage of your knowledge and toss you away when they have gotten what they needed at the time. Untruthful and unreliable place to achieve your income goals.
bad,"They are an ok company to work for if you are just an associate, managers do not get treated as well."
bad,"Very stressful place to work for. No consideration for family life or employees well being. When there is an executive visit, you have to work until you drop regardless of wether you are able or not !"
bad,"By working for the franchise, I had the opportunity to learn the in's and out's on retail sales. How to market your product as well as representing your place of business as if it was you own. I also learned that having a friendly and inviting appearance makes the customer/client feel reassured that they are making the right decision when purchasing from you."
bad,"Store manager is beyond horrible. Very belittling, talks to employees any kind of way cursing included. A job where regular colleagues are treated as expendable. Building is falling apart, mold is really bad,  roof is leaking everywhere, and you're subject to work in whatever the temperature is outside."
bad,"The managers were absolutely crazy I was hired as part-time for 20-25 hours a week however they would completely disregard my availability and schedule me whenever they wanted and would justify it by saying they ""looked up what days I have school"" and would sometimes schedule me 40+ hours it was so stressful. I am a student and they would not work with me when I had exams telling me that I had to pick between school and Dillards. There was absolutely no communication from my department manager who I would barely see, and the other store manager (there was two) was so insane that instead of doing anything productive for the company she would just sit in the camera room watching every single associate's every move because apparently they are more worried about what their employees are doing rather than what customers are doing. We had a few security guards that were also not the best as we got robbed several times in the short few months I was there since nothing is censored. They also didn't really allow us to take any time off and have fired several people for asking for even just 3 days off. So many of the employees are super childish and start so much drama for no reason, all people care about is their sales which makes sense because we have sales goals to meet (that tend to be super high despite the low amount of people shopping) that you get punished for not meeting, but the lengths people will go to in order to steal sales from others is ridiculous. I would hear employees get into fights and yell at each other over sales. Not only that but so many people are super fake"
bad,You just sit in a camera room for 10+ hours a day that you aren't allowed to leave. No one calls to make sure you're doing okay. If you have health issues its definitely something you dont want to do. Sometimes the managers wont call you back when you need to make a stop for a theft. As long as they make their sales they dont care about anything.
bad,Quotas are next to impossible to meet. High turnover. Training is a joke. Your pretty much thrown into a position. Your just a number to them. CEOs never talk to sales people when they visit the store.
bad,"Overall terrible experience with corporate culture, mgmt and expectations. You are set up to fail from day one and they do not care about their employees."
bad,The only thing they care about is getting sales.  There is no job or pay security as if you are not meeting unrealistic sales goals you can lose pay. They don’t run sales like a Macy’s store and so it’s almost impossible to keep up with their demand
bad,"Poor management "
bad,Honestly I wish I could rate management a zero because my store manager had ZERO clue how to run a store so its basically a free for all. I would never recommend working here. The turn over is atrocious and people will show up whenever they want to. You might have years of retail experience but someone who has no experience will be making more then you.
bad,Terrible place to work. They pay decent which is why people initially go and work there but sales goals are unrealistic and management is never on the same page.
bad,"Management is only worried about $$$.  They do not care about you or your family.  Department managers, who are salary employees, basically live at the store.  Upper management does not support them unless their department is making money.  RUN!!!"
bad,"Aside from your coworkers, the place is always empty. Plus, management has unrealistic sales goals that are impossible to meet due to the lack of customers. Not to mention the fact that even if you do convince someone to make a purchase, management takes returns no matter how old it is. For example, a customer purchased some shoes from me and came to return them 5 months later. Despite it being 5 months old, beat up, and busted, my manager took it back. This also made my numbers take a hit, so bad enough that my numbers low as is, my manager pinned the blame on me for ""not convincing them enough""."
bad,"Some rules are violated with permission of the manager when it's for their convenient. People family  members caught stealing after doing sooo long management knowing and refuse to arrest and Associate still have job. The fairness is horrible and some of the rules is.hard (quote, credit appts.) Business"
bad,Corporate/Management makes it very clear you are replaceable. They do not value you. Impossible to work with time off even paid vacation. With the “rules” placed for thief prevention is a joke. They pretty allow it which is frustrating to see. Always a stressful environment.
bad,"Worked for many locations memorial, Sugarland, Pearland but the absolute worst was Willowbrook. The store manager works you like crazy changing schedules taking away days off. She basically works 6 1/2 to 7 days a week open to close and she expects us to do the same bc we’re salary. Horrible upper management, no one in corporate cares and you better not complain bc that can be your job"
bad,"If upper management didn’t like you they  got rid of you ."
bad,"Management is HORRIBLE!!!! Constantly battling with ignorance and hatred. Borderline hostile work environment... sales goals are impossible to reach and you are constantly having to pressure customers into applying for credit cards and pushing them to higher priced items so you don’t lose your job over not reaching your daily sales goals (some of which are upwards of $1,500...) Youre not even allowed to talked with other sales associates in other departments without being yelled at for doing nothing. More than half the time the store is empty bc prices are so high and the  escalators  And elevators aren’t working..."
bad,Good job for seasonal workers. They are not flexible when it comes to schedules.  Management only cares about hitting goals and getting credits. They only care about what is good for the store and not there employees.  Think twice beofre working here. They will make you think that it is the greatest place to work and a great emplyee discount but what they dont tell you if you dont if your are PT and dont work a certain amount of hours (cant remember the amount of hour). You are not eligible for the Discount at Dillards.
bad,"*The only way to get a raise was to get promoted.  "
bad,"I worked at the store for 15 months. "
bad,Managers are really uptight and focused more on little things that had nothing to do with sales. Not much traffic came in through the store which made it really hard to reach unrealistic goals set for employees. Not somewhere you can expect to move up and improve.
bad,You can be with the company for 5+ years and only get a 50 cent raise. However if you do not meet sales goals your pay will decrease by the dollar every yearly evaluation. Sales goals are truly unrealistic. They don’t have an HR number posted anywhere and if you try to ask fo it they make it hard to get.
bad,"Everything they do revolves around whether or not you get a credit app for them or not. If you want a day off, etc. they don’t care about you. Only them. The schedules is different every month and they still have quotas for every person. If you don’t meet your numbers you get a pay cut or fired"
bad,"Stressful, don't care about your life or family, breaks work labor laws!!!!  Never want you to take a break after 5pm... Willing to fire you if nothing goes the managers way"
bad,Managment is terrible. You don’t get the days you ask for off. If you need a certain day off for something you have to constantly remind them. You constantly are feeling like you are going to get fired. You have to meet a quota daily which is impossible to meet.
bad,"The management at this place is absolutely horrible. They belittle you and threaten you for anything they possibly can. The favoritism is unreal! Counter managers and store managers gossip about employees, which makes its way onto the floor and causes this place to feel like a high school. Sales goals are unrealistic which caused a lot of sharking and arguments between associates.The hours are all day everyday; good luck getting any days off! Even if you notify them MONTHS in advance or even before you are hired, managers will act like it’s not their problem and if you tell them you won’t be able to make it due to an emergency, they talk to you like you’re incompetent. There’s no communication and this place is so un-organized it’s unreal. The money is great for standing around all day, but not worth the stress you will endure working for this company. There’s also no HR to contact, so nothing changes. Do yourself a favor and run away from this place!"
bad,"Welcomed guests to department and engaged them in fruitful conversation."
bad,"You are a barcode when you work for Dillard's, literally. That number you clock in with is your barcode number.  You are so replaceable that if you last awhile, you may actually see your whole team you started with be replaced. Sales goals are absurd. Occasionally they are attainable but not regularly. "
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone, not equal for all associates, they pick and choose who they want to promote.   Will bring in some people part-time and then promote them and most associates are part-time."
bad,"RUNN!! Dog eat Dog environment!!! Very, very insecure job working in a hostile and individually competitive environment.   Employees are verbally intimidated by management  into obtaining credit applicants weekly, and punished in various ways for necessary sick calls; Employees become combative, conniving and rude in order to protect and maintain their daily sales quotas.  High employee and management turnover; Patronizing managers who are condescending and disrespectful to employees by offering menial incentives for sales performances and credit applicants.  No appreciation for employee loyalty; only concerned with numbers which fluctuates per season. Employees are treated like children. Discard you when they have finished using you and your connections."
bad,"for ten years with the company, the salary was very low, no bonuses or raises.  A lot of bullying allowed my managers and low people skills.  Working in the mall was a joy."
bad,Job has very unreasonable quotas that are not researched based on demographics of area. High turn over rate. In 6 months over 20 employees quit with no notice. Upper management does not teach or explain what was expected which resulted in employees fearing their job daily. As well as quotas create every associate to work in hostility.
bad,"Management is terrible. They do not care about their employees as much as they say. The location I worked at makes such a huge deal about watching out for thieves and will reprimand us if they get away with stuff. But also have a sign in the security office that says “If you didn’t see it, it didn’t happen”. Not to mention they receive money in their budget to cover such thefts and do not have tags on any of their items. The weekly pay is nice but it’s not worth all the work you do since they’re almost always short staffed since they can’t hold on to anyone. Unrealistic sales goals that control your pay rate and your job that don’t take into affect the day or time of the year or how many other people there are in your department. I would highly recommend against working here."
bad,"A typical day at work is so slow you could watch paint dry yet they expect you to make $600 in 3 hours."
bad,Management in the  accessories department was absolutely horrific. Management DOES NOT care about their employees and often discriminates. Management would often lie to their employees and make promises they have no intention on following through with along with gossiping about their own employees. Threats on your position in the company are often made if you fall b below quota. I seen people get pay-cuts for falling a dollar short of their SPH.
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"I love my job dont get me wrong but there is no"
bad,"Poor leadership from the top down, minimal support and little opportunity for advancement from within at most levels.  Workplace culture is extremely negative."
bad,"The morale at this place is horrific. They treat employees as if they're all replaceable, threaten loss of salary or loss of your job if company goals are not met, and goals are not set in store, they are set by corporate who has no idea what the local floor traffic is like. Nobody was ever in a good mood or wanted to be there. Customers stole from the store and employees were told not to do anything about it. In order to get your employee discount you have to open a Dillard's card which you can use as a debit card, they enrolled me in a line of credit without my consent."
bad,"This employers hires too many sales agents to support the sales quotas making a very cut throat work environment where co-workers steal sales from others to make their quota. If personal sales quotas are not met, the company terminates employees that do not meet the sales goal."
bad,There is a constant fear from all the employees that you will fired.  It's  extremely slow paced and impossible to reach sales goals.  The overall work environment is negative and hostile.
bad,"all of the managers are power hungry. you ask for a day off months in advance and they never give it to you, they always change the schedule while you are gone and not tell you about it till you're already late.."
bad,"Employees are held accountable to unfair standards of sales and credit card sign ups. If you fail to meet those goals, they actually LOWER your pay even if you do everything else right!"
bad,Even though you do everything  you are  suppose  to and meet your numbers they were never happy. I got accused of doing things that I didn't do. I chose to quit my job there because I won't work at a place that I'm unhappy with.
bad,"Dillards isn't a type of job that motivates you to strive for greatness in your life.This job is very cut-throat, anyone can try their hardest but not good enough."
bad,There is to much reverse racism in this call center I'm always scared to go to work . There needs to be some major changes with this call center. This is one of the worst jobs I've ever had.
bad,There’s a reason this company is on Forbes worst companies to work for. Pay is great but the environment and poor management is just not worth it. It doesn’t help that management does not value their employees
bad,"cut throat focus on sales goals only required to meet a daily sales goal, after a certain time period if not reached they let you go without consideration"
bad,"There is no consistency with the Store Manager, One day its one thing than the next its something else. Training in the Company in a ZERO. They put you in a position and expect you to know what to do."
bad,They will lie to you to make you do what they want.  They don't care about your personal life and they don't compensate or promote for results so don't bother trying.
bad,BEWARE! Dillard's is the most unorganized and unprofessional company that I have ever worked for. Managers were rude to employees and customers alike. Unrealistic sales goals created a hostile working environment because of the pressure to make goals. The store manager and other managers do not care how cut-throat and ruthless sales associates are if they are making their numbers. It was always extremely slow at this location and there would be hours at a time that there would not be a single customer to help out. Overall that was the worst job I've ever had.
bad,"When I was working at Dillards I started at $12.50 but every 3 months they will either drop your pay or raise your pay depending if you made the sales goals within those 3 months."
bad,I would never work for this company again.  Drastic pay cuts when unrealistic sales goals aren't met.  Management practices are ridiculous.  These issues led to a poor work environment.  The only reason I stayed as long as I did is because I enjoyed my coworkers.
bad,"Management have no idea how to effectively train, motivate and incentivize employees. Scheduling is chaotic, compensation is awful, systems are archaic. This place is ripe for a Harvard Business School Case Study in how to Destroy what was once a half decent family business. If you don't mind being exploited and managed by a group of misguided social justice dullards than this place might just be right for you."
bad,"Management is very poor. They make you feel inferior and it was very uncomfortable trying to talk to any upper management."
bad,This is the absolute worse place one can work. Management is completely lacking in any communication skills.  Shows no sign of sympathy towards it's workers-regardless of death or illness.  I was criticized for being too nice to my guest & co-workers.
bad,"If you didn't meet sales goals, you'd eventually lose your job. That being said, the sales goals were ridiculously high and if you meet them one day, they'd bump to the next day. Even a customer returning an item would count against you so it is horrible to try to maintain a job there. People would fight over who gets to help the customer and take the sale. It lead to a lot of unfair treatment."
bad,"My first day, the manager of the men's department legitamitely asked if I was autistic and asked how I was able to get a job there without having a green card."
bad,"Desert Sky location was very poorly managed!!! Management pits employee verses employee and promote unfair and a unsafe work environment!!!!"
bad,I would only recommend this job to someone that does not care about job security and does not care if they can advance or not. The customers are generally very pleasant and most of the employees are fun to work with.  Dillards does offer company discount on clothing and everything else they sell.
bad,"a typical day on the job, is very slow compared to what I am use to, the sales Quota they expect of you I believe is un realistic. For as slow as it is in any department especially. Training is a sham, and very poorly, driven. Upper management is very upbeat, area managers are full of gossip and talk behind your back, unwilling to work with you when you are on disability and have health issues."
bad,"They bring you in with a high pay, but other than that the job has no benefits.  They are the number one priority in your life and nothing else matters."
bad,"This job is a fit if you are single, living at home with mom & dad, or mom or dad and attending college. I'll also mention; if you are desperate for part time work. Otherwise; go elsewhere. If you join; only expect to stay a year. They lie from the initial interview, set you up for failure and weed you out because they want the turn over to continue paying the lower salary. Do not expect raises."
bad,"Worked and managed salon, I worked here for 5 years and hired staff, recruited, placed orders, inventory control, I educated and trained staff, I made quarterly and monthly plans, monthly reports, conferece calls, new hire training, much much more"
bad,"Management is only concerned with your sales numbers and will fire you if you don't reach their quotas. Lack of consideration for slow days when no one is in the store, employees will backstab you and steal your sales to keep their own jobs. Management expects you to keep your workspace clean even though they only pay you to sell. Everyone there sees you as a pawn that they are willing to sacrifice. Management doesn't care about your personal life and changes schedules suddenly and without prior approval or notice. Everyone is very selfish here and will throw you under the bus behind your back if they can get something out of it."
bad,Worked long hours even though was a full time student. They started me out in a department that was not busy so hard to make sales quota. If you sold something out of a different department other employees would get mad because they are trying to make their quota as well. By the end of the first 3 months I was struggling with my sales and they did nothing to help. No training to help build my numbers. They fired me after 6 months of my making my quota. Managers also favored certain employees. The only benefit was the decent pay. By far the worst job I've had when it comes to management and caring/building up employees.
bad,"some days were busy most slow"
bad,there was never enough employees on the floor and they fought over customers. Upper management was all about numbers and did not care about their employees.
bad,"I worked with the corporate office. If you like being micromanaged  by unqualified jerks, working unpaid OT, and with little to no holiday time, Dillards is the place for you!"
bad,"customers are amazing, the management is not only care about the bottom dollar not employees or its customers would not recommend it for a job"
bad,loved working with the public. Had many loyal clients after my 13 years with this company. Management made everyday hard by threatening your job if you didn't open credit cards or sell your required quota. Also harassed people like myself that worked their way up over the years and made more money an hour than most managers.
bad,"Management was poor, dated and inefficient systems, horrible job work/life balance, no considerations for personal/sick needs. Constant entry-level turn over, no promotion availability. No HR department to voice opinions or concerns."
bad,"Workday generally consisted of doing markdowns, putting out stock, all while having to make a quota. I learned that I am not physically able to do those things and be able to make their quotas. Management in general were nice people, but had to go by company rules. My co-workers were very nice people, but the working environment created by the company made many of them cut throat in trying to meet their quotas. The hardest part of the job for me was doing markdowns in that it required hour upon hour of bending over which caused excruciating pain in my back. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling when I had time to do it. I truly enjoyed meeting the customers and finding products that made them leave feeling that I had given them the five-star service that the company liked for their associates to achieve."
bad,Probably the worst place to work on the planet. You have 15 different bosses but none of them really know what is going on. Maybe if they trained their management team instead of just saying good luck they wouldn't have so much turnover.
bad,Not a good place to work in general. The company shows no appreciation for it's associates and their hard work.  They fire them with no warning.  This is at a corporate level too.
bad,"we were asked to meet sales quotas, we were also asked to do whatever it takes to get customers to sign up for their rewards CREDIT card and sometimes they even approved lying to customers. job security was non existent."
bad,Dillard's is a very hostile work environment. The management team needs a lot of work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the quote. The part I miss the most is my customers.
bad,"I took the job as a sales manager based on the initial salary offering, not realizing that the salary was the only attractive part of the job. The ""benefits"" offered at the time were 20/80, whereby the company paid 20 and the employee paid 80."
bad,"This is a place that has no job security, managment is moody and has there favorites. Constantly change your schedule without notice."
bad,"they expect you to reach a high sale quota or you get fired"
bad,A very competitive work place. There is no job security. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and knowing that you helped them.
bad,I managed a team of 7 people.  Oversaw daily operations and inventory.  Responsible for scheduling of my team.  Motivated team members to drive sales numbers by creating contest and positive reinforcement.  Interviewed candidates for employment.  The work environment was very hostile.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the new inventory that was unloaded.
bad,I enjoy the people I work with but the management team is all for themselves. I have never worked for a company that has NO positive employees. Everyone hates their job and I am a positive person who tries to make the workday fun.
bad,The environment is highly competitive and would at times become vicious to the point that the customers were uncomfortable. The sales goals were impossible for the amount of traffic. Management encouraged bad behavior especially in the commissioned based departments.
bad,"Unrealistic sale quotas, overstaffed, doesn't care if customers are hounded or harassed by desperate sales associates as long as numbers are made. To be on top you have to play dirty, and I've witnessed ""top sellers"" attack and get in fights with other associates over ringing up sells with no consequences from management. Unprofessional."
bad,"I was able to merchandise and put stock out on my own in order to generate sales.  I was the only employee who worked in that area for 2 years.  "
bad,"The Dillards and upper management are unapproachable and care nothing about the people that work for them. They walk through their stores and never interact with the associates.  "
bad,Management was unresponsive to most employee request and continually understaffed the shoe department making it difficult to properly help guests with their needs.
bad,"Horrible place to work, Management finds it easiest to get rid of productive employees for more easily controlled 18 year olds"
bad,They are reasonable to employees only until it doesn't suit them. Would rather fire a good employee to hire one bad one off of unemployment to get the federal tax bonus.
bad,"Worst job that I ever had. Pay was good, but benefits were so expensive (and terrible) that it didn't matter. Absolutley no work life balance. You are expected to live and breathe Dillard's. Upper managment is a joke, have no idea what it means to actually work!! Very behind in the times when it comes to processes. Modern day slavery!! Run far away!"
bad,Worst company i have ever worked for . Do not work here. Sucky pay and the management treats you like garbage.
bad,"flea market atmosphere. Management consists of power/control fanatics! They only see dollar signs, and could care less about employees."
bad,The really sad thing is I worked there for ten years and loved it so much! But so many people would get fired right before they were to retire.awesome managers who gave them 25-30 years and boom your fired!!!!it was so sad! Then all the covering up we had to do was like we were living in a fantasy world every time we had a corporate visit! So much lying going around to the Dillard's it was a sin.so glad to be out of there !!
bad,"Best thing about working at this store would be the starting out at $10 and $10 training part. And being 401k eligible. Every person has a goal. they make it 3 times as much as it should be. they set you up to fail. if you ever, by some miracle get your raise goal, they will move you to a different department so they dont have to give you the raise. They will cut your pay and then let you go. its a revolving door, thats how they want it. Be prepared to completely change as a person and have no life what-so-ever. You are not allowed to go to school, not allowed to request any days off, hardly earn ANY vacation time even after being with them a whole year! You never see the managers, they don't know what they're doing at all. They tell you they're going to take care of things ""oh just email me about it"" and never do any of it! You get hired on not knowing where you're going, training is 3 weeks long and they don't decide what they're going to do & where theyre going to put you until the last day. I got put in kids shoes, after specifically saying if I got put in the home department ill quit. Kids sboes is the ABSOLUTE SLOWEST, and pointless department in the entire store. Kids shoes and kids clothes should be all one. Men's shoes, and ladies shoes are commission, but not kids shoes. You're lucky if you see anyone all day and I'm talking about working 12-9 and 9:45-6 or 7."
bad,"Dillards does not value their employees at all. They veiw them as dispoable people to use them as they wish. Theyve recently stopped hiring anyone for fulltime to avoid paying any kind of benefits, and their sales review system is based upon an archaic system designed by their founder when the compnay began. They set your monthly sales goal so high that the odds of anyone hitting their mark is akin to winning the lottery. when you dont hit your mark you become indebted to the company by the amount you lacked o meet your goal, and this amount carries over to the next month. This is done so that you will dig yourself into a hole, and then they can let you go whenever they would like and use your sales debt as an excuse. Avoid them if you can at all cost. When you interview for them they will be all smiles and full of smoke and lies dont buy it. They will chew you up and very uncerimoniously spit you out when it fancies them. I repeatt Avoid Dillards at all cost."
bad,"Before I applied here, I researched the company and ran across a lot of negative reviews. I just assumed that it was a couple of angry employees but their accusations were dead on! I have never hated a job but they changed the game for me. The sales quotas are ridiculous and unattainable, management is unfair, and unless you are caucasian, blonde, or gay, there is no room for advancement. This company sucks, SAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND DON'T APPLY!"
bad,"Sales Associate - Sales associate in Dillard’s high end men’s clothing store. Men’s furnishings department. Make hourly sales goals, make customer relations to build a clientele for sales, fashion consultant in men’s clothing."
bad,"dont work there unless you are a manipulative SOB! after doing what I could to increase business and organize my work space, I was informed that they were going to cut my pay by 10%. I would have had to live on the street. so I left. PS...I increased their business... I always do..."
bad,"Sales Sales Sales... might as well be a dollar store. This is a typical store that sells items. I was recruited to work for them and after several years learned that the value of an employee is a myth. I served under 6 managers... in my area alone. Two more tiers above that level. I worked.. prepared inventory, helped customers.. to see 15 year vets of the company forced out. If you work there and know one knows the product there is a reason. After 200 + people were fired.. or driven mad by their policies I was finally beheaded before Christmas. Yes it was a good present."
bad,I worked in the lady's wear dept.I did their sales and waited on customers.I worked with the public.I meant alot of people from all over the world .i really liked working there the management wasn't so great
bad,I was under the impression that this place was going to be a fun team experience. That was far from true! Everyone gossips about everyone. The employees ALWAYS complain about work and management.
bad,I had to leave early due to stomach pain and management thought I was lying and told me I should be fired. Left went to the hospital to find out it was internal bleeding. Also when corporate came everyone suddenly had to be in dress code and actually do there job.
bad,"Stay away from dillards. Too much favoritism...no good work vibe with upper management. Have to get credit card applications weekly or you go to class on Sunday(off or not 10:30 am class). You will be threatened no app, no job."
bad,The store manger was horrible and fired many people over nothing. Horrible place to work and will never work there again. Was very disappointed in how they treated they’re employees
bad,if you’re desperate for money i’d recommend. but just make sure it’s not going to be anything long term. unless you enjoy misery. then you’ll love it.
bad,Don't work here if you have physical issues.   If you have children don't work here because they will not give you time off for appointments with them.  Raises are poor.   They work you like a slave and you don't have any time for your personal life.   Management is very cold and demanding for you to meet your goals.  The competition to meet your goals creates hostility among the people in your area.
bad,"Awful management poor decisions no Human Resources.  No set schedule changes daily poor management overall."
bad,I was a sales Manager with Dillards. Because I had to miss 2 days of work because I had a sick child I was demoted to Business Manager. I feel you start employees high pay just to take it away
bad,Not the best experience working here. Favoritism is at an all time high. Poor/unfair management. Turn over is extremely high. Some people go on their lunch break and never come back it’s so bad. Inappropriate relations between coworkers. If the store manager doesn’t like you he will force you to put in your 2 weeks notice. Overall a terrible experience and very shady company.
bad,"Fun job , a ton of inventory work . ASM and management are good however counter business managers are often under qualified and lack the skills to lead affectively . Loss prevention is needed at the store . Many people are lazy and because they have been there a long time they get away with things other people would never be able too . Often times unrealistic sales goals"
bad,"Comapny does not promote from within !!! Your hard work goes unnoticed and managemnet is micromanaged . If you dont meet your yearly sales goal you get a pay cut. Instead of praising you for your hard work they say you could of done better. The start pay is descent,but is not promised if you dont make your goals. Employees doing managements job so on and so forth its a horrible place to work for . There is no room for growth PERIOD!!"
bad,"Did not enjoy much at all in the Dillard’s environment! Management was poor , expectations were unrealistic and poorly executed! "
bad,"Management is a joke! Managers get together to talk about employees to other employees. Very toxic work environment. You will be stressed out. They pit employees against each out, they think you cant sale if you are friends with your coworkers. Your sales goal are ridiculously high. Will have 3 workers in one area each with a quote of 2500$ to make and on a Monday..... they micromanage you to death, take credit for your achievements and throw you to the wolves when you when you fail to make your numbers. They have the highest pay rate of any department store but so many people leave because of management."
bad,High turnover due to unreasonable sales goals.  Held accountable for many things out of your personal control.  Lack of support from store and asst store manager.
bad,"Racism was shown towards the customers and employees. Poor management and security, also will say they can work with your schedule but actually won't."
bad,Management is terrible in the Slidell location. If you do not get what is needed for your Credit cards apps for the month they will not let you leave until you get one. It's very hard to get credit card apps this day in age nobody wants a credit card! Sometimes very difficult quota's to reach daily. If you don't reach what is needed that day it will put you in the hole the next day. If there is a theft in the store they will treat the employees badly over it. It's like working in a prison they will go through your belongings and even take your cell phone! The other employees are good people!! Just the Management makes it horrible to work here!
bad,"Is one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had in my life, the mangers don’t know how to do their jobs and they’ve all been in management for years. It’s ridiculous...the people make you want to walk out on a regular basis. There is no advancement in the company, no gratification, no matter how much experience you have. Just terrible...they are also prejudice"
bad,Policies  changed also did your job security.even if you have been there more than 20+yrs and you didnt meat one yr your goals you got fired. That's because you made thousands of dollars per yr to the company.
bad,I enjoyed it at first the work environment was good but after we got a new store Manager things went down from there. She looked down on her employees and didn’t care about personal things going on in her employees life. She was the worst person to work for and I would not recommend working for that company.
bad,They will pay good but when you work for Dillard’s your whole life revolves around this job I couldn’t be off with my sick child have to get people to sign up for credit card
bad,Horrible place to work it’s so competitive you literally have to fight everyday for sales nothing they do makes sense they will work you to the bone to where the pay doesn’t even matter like literally everyone is so tired their were days I didn’t even wanna walk in their I was so tired your life revolves around Dillard’s
bad,"When you work full time in retail, you do not have any work life balance. Is very difficult during the holiday season to spend any time with your family and friends."
bad,Unprofessional. Absolutly no communication. No job security. There is no training and you are just thrown on the floor. Toxic coworkers and managers. Unrealistic SPH goals. Managers play favorites hard and lie left and right to their employees. Horrible work enviroment.
bad,Management was so poor and so out of touch with employees that it overshadowed the decent pay and benefits. Store manager was mean and nasty and the assistant store manager dressed so inappropriately it made employees uncomfortable.
bad,"Upper management holds all the cards, Your opinion doesnt't matter, frowned upon."
bad,People that cause drama constantly and tell on people to be close with the manager when they hardly work themselves. Everyone is always on their phones and  walk around. You do the most simple tasks there that don't improve you as a person. Too many shady things that happen there and makes you feel less of a person. Too much leverage on coming into work hung over or on drugs.
bad,"Associates were great,but treated poorly,unless you were in the click! Terrible negativity in upper management,you can never do anything right,no matter how hard you try,Great pay,but if you go home crying every day,money just isn't worth your sanity! Extreme turn over rate. If you take a job there,I wish you luck,you're gonna need it!"
bad,This company has been around for years and so has their business practices. They still cling to ancient practices that are not conducive to today's shopping environment. They have extremely high sales associates goals but not always the customer traffic to support those goals. Even though at least 10% of their daily sales were coming from the internet they could not run this program correctly. They also did not assign these orders to department associates so the associates were losing sales due to this. The training was non-existent and management threatens employee's every morning with their job's. Management did not care about their associates as long as they were not bothering them. The only thing that this company has going for them is that the starting pay they offer is higher than the other retailers in the same class.
bad,"I worked here for 6 months in the juniors department were you were given daily sales goals to reach even tthough there was no customers to sell to. Watch out for other employees they will act nice to your face but steal your customers as soon as you turn your back. You are penalized for something you have no control over, if a customer decides to return their impulse buy or even sometimes used clothes or would come out of your daily sale goals. Dont expect to be rewarded for your hard work they only promote those who reach their sales goals even if they've never worked in that department for a day. The only way to enjoy working here is by accepting you arent going to reach your sale goals but still have to put up the hundreds of dresses that people never planned on buying."
bad,"Nonexistant care for employees and outright discrimination. I passed out due to a medical condition and was fired for ""sleeping"" on the job. When I tried to explain myself the manager over the store fired me without informing the security manager all because he disliked his lack of control over security. Terrible company"
bad,"As a Sales Associate, your job depends on the sales you make and returns do count against you, despite the company's inability to offer competitive prices and marketable products. In addition, I worked at the Great Lakes location where management was very unorganized and none of the managers liked their job. Management ignored the Sales Associates and we competed with Macys in the mall, who offered lower prices and discounts for the same prices."
bad,"Work, life balance is not something you will get here.  Pay is good over all, you do have to maintain a certain amount of sales in order to get more money."
bad,We had a decent manager until someone from children’s took over cosmetics.  He made several inappropriate comments to me and my coworkers.  I’ve heard he left the store but I wasn’t even comfortable going to upper management before I quit.  The district head left several months ago and was not replaced so I couldn’t talk to her either.  Awful experience
bad,"Not just my opinion. I have spoken to previous employees and the problems are the same. High quotas that increase every review period. You get 3.months to make your quota then your pay gets docked. 3 more months you get written up and then let go. Everyone stressing about quotas that you notice people are so desperate they steal your sales.If you get moved to another Dept that sells lower price merchandise, they don't lower your quota. If you work in apparel, your job is all day picking up and putting clothes away after messy customers throwing them on the floor after bring in an average of 25 pieces in a dressing room. No cooperation with coworkers because it's all about making your quota. Marking down items constantly. Covert threats made by coworkers but nothing done about it. On your feet 40 hours a week. Have to work holidays and mall hours."
bad,"You can be there for 10 years and if you dont make your quota youre out. This makes the work culture extremely competitive, backstabbing, stealing customers from coworkers, no work morals, agressive salespeople who hang out in the aisles, follow and badger customers for sales. The management dosent foster teamwork, its every man for themselves, and the bottom line is the company goal."
bad,They constantly harass you to get credit card applications from customers and when you don’t meet the amount they want you to have they make you come in before hours or on your day off to re train.
bad,This was a very bad place to work. They paid very well but it wasn't worth it due to the managers not caring about when they schedule you even if you asked off. The coworkers had to fight for clients so the work environment was not the best.
bad,if you work there full time the hours they give you are stupid!!!! you only get one sunday off per month (aka your always working weekends) they give you a crazy high sales goal and put so much pressure on you to sell. you have to be on your feet literally your whole 8 hr shift
bad,"Unequal pay, inexperienced management and sale duties are more then just selling concentrated. Associates are responsible for all duties in the store making it hard to provide excellent customer service."
bad,"Management was subjective at best/extreme favoritism."
bad,Unrealistic sales goal for the amount of hours scheduled. Working with customers was my highlight of the day. Management was tough on schedules and sales goals. Favoritism was a big problem amongst management.
bad,"The management talks down to associates, calls everyone stupid and lazy.  But if you are in their click, you can steal, break policies and even fight on the sales floor and not be reprimanded."
bad,"I loved my job the people I worked with in my department. One manager was rude, mean and only cared for the people she liked. You could tell who management favored and who they didn't. Returns were held against you. You sold the item, spent time with the customer closed the deal and you are made to fill that you did not do your job because they take returns back against you!!! Not fair. I saw a lot of good faithful employees leave because of the quota's expected. Things will not change they can hire a million people and the same result will happen. They do not have the customer base to maintain sells that they want anymore."
bad,Dillard's is a typical corporate company concerned with turning a profit and hitting sales quotas that they turn a blind eye to their employees. If  you are a college student that needs a simply job with a simply amount of money this would be a good place to work.
bad,Dillard's only cares about the sales number and not there employees. Not  a great work environment. Managers even make it feel cut throat so you will hit your quota.
bad,"The management I had made me feel like I was ""just another employee"" I never felt valued in my position.  The sales quota I had was nearly impossible, as I worked part time as a second job.  The hours I worked were basically just the closing shift and there were days I didn't see one customer in the whole store, yet I had to meet my quota.  It felt impossible."
bad,"Was told I would be making 9.5% commission on everything I sold and would have a biyearly review with opportunities for pay increase based on performance. Turns out that commission rate only applies to full price items, and if it is on clearance then the rate goes down to 3% of the clearance price. That was never mentioned to me. I've only had one review and they just told me to sign a paper stating we had it and then I was told to leave. I was due for my second review over a month ago. "
bad,"Upper Management only cares about themselves.  The small people that make the store run are negatively looked upon. Unless you dress like a street walker, you wont get anywhere."
bad,"Extremely stressful position that management places all sales associates who have to fight and compete with other employees for sales from customers walking in. Employees get into verbal confrontations right on the floor and customers sometimes witness these arguments. It all revolves around the fact that they expect you to be ringing so many dollars per hour and if you fail to ring up your dollar amount for your shift, it goes against you and accumulates to the point of employees being in the negative on sales per hour. WHen customers return merchandise it goes against the employee that sold the merchandise by it hiking up the amount of sales you must ring. It was the most unpleasant highly stressful position i have ever been working under. THey would have 5-6 employees covering the department/floor and there may be 1-2 customers walking around and all the employees would practically run the the customers to claim them as their customers. They would even tell them that they had to come back to them with their merchandise and that they must use their fitting rooms"
bad,"Sales and appearance of the store is all upper management cares about. They perform store visits, but never interact with the associates who help pay their salaries. It's really sad. I worked in Customer Service and they are treated like minions. The service desk is the first impression of the store. The associates work hard to multi task, while answering phones, gift wrapping, assisting associates and waiting on customers. With all these multi tasking and  very minimal staffing, you're required to answer the phone by the second ring! There's no communication of sales going on to this dept; yet the customer service desk is the first line to answer questions asked by the public! Additionally, management never recognizes their  accomplishments; Training is poor for the whole store and it appears that the company doesn't care that some of the people they hire can't count money or possess any accountability. The only means of advancement is to sell on the sales floor and even at that, you don't really get to choose where you want to go. They don't care about what your passions are in order to succeed. They only care about filling in holes and gaps. The hiring process is a joke. People are hired at more than minimum wage; yet most of these people have no experience for the role they're hired in! Yet, existing associates who have experience are not able to advance within the company. The company would rather invest their time on new hires and interns, pay them more than grow their existing employees. Very poor management skills and crazy schedule changes without notice to their employees."
bad,"If you don't make your numbers, you get fired."
bad,"If you are looking for something part time while in school I'd say go for it, but Dillard's is definitely not a career path to take. Management makes up rules as they go, older employees that have been there do whatever they want and complaints go unnoticed."
bad,Too much pressure to sell in order to meet hourly sales quota.  Customers can check out with whoever they wish and not the associate who assisted them. Other sales associates do not ask if you helped them.  They steal your sale.
bad,Dillard's hires unexperience and bad managers for management.There's no advancement for the employees who been working there for several years. Making stupid policies. Always firing and hiring people for sale goals.
bad,"Dillard's expects its employees to want to work with Dillard's for the rest of their lives. If that's what you want, go for it. If not, even the high pay isn't enough to make up for the way you get treated. Management was passive aggressive, boss was insufferable, competition to the point of hate is encouraged, the only respite was that almost all of my coworkers were in the same boat (college students, desperate to eat). I worked part time and they worked me as close to full time as they could without going over, even when I asked for fewer hours. I had to quit with almost no notice after asking fewer hours for finals week and being given MORE. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"Arrive early and stay late because the expectations are continually changing."
bad,High turn over rate and cut throat. Manager's are constantly down your throat if you aren't making your quota. It doesn't matter how long you have been there.
bad,This job is horrible!! Poor management. Lack of communication between higher management and associates. Cut throat. Unrealistic goals to make sales. Everything seems to be your fault. No credit is given when you do an amazing job. They want you to still work even when your dying sick. Will not tell you when you get a pay cut. You basically do everything while management gets the credit! The only positive thing is the pay
bad,The job started out great but with time it turned from great to just a job i showed up to. Its fun helping out customers and planning out events. Meeting new people and creating those connections with customers. The management overall isn't the best they don't really create a great environment for you to thrive in. It can be very stressful so if working in a fast paced environment isn't for you don't pick dillards. They don't tell you what your getting paid and then you run the risk of getting a pay cut a few months after starting and they don't help you get it back.
bad,Had good coworkers and customers. I was under stress because i had to sell. I had not very good manager she never apreciate our work. I always did My best.
bad,Dillard's as a company has declined and the morale at the Woodland's location is one of the worst environments I have ever experienced.  There is partiality there that seems to be based on race.
bad,"After working here for over 1 1/2 years, nothing has changed since I began. Although I do not work on commission, nor do most departments, the atmosphere created allows for associates to take sales from others, without repercussions, in order to make sales to meet sales goals. When sales goals from the previous day/week are not met, they are added to the next day. However, if more is sold than goal, this does not carry over to the next week."
bad,"managers sexually harass the females and nothing gets done except they are told ""not to do what they've been doing again"" literally nothing will happen except they find out that you told on them."
bad,Would not recommend anyone for this company. Very cutthroat and confusing buisness to be in. Goals aren't adequate or comparable to corporate numbers. Management is difficult to talk with.
bad,"Dillards is the worst company I've ever worked for. You're in constant threat of having your salary cut because they base your rate of pay off the outdated SPH system. The management is terrible, very immature. There is constant gossip and bickering between employees because everyone fights for sales.  There is little to no traffic on any given day So that leads to hours of standing around with nothing to do, wasting time. The benefits package is ok, and pay is ok but they always dangle your SPH over your head and threaten pay cuts. Stay away if you can!!!!"
bad,"The corporate culture at Dillard's teaches managers to intimidate their employees into working unsavory hours and fighting other coworkers harder for their sales. Sales per hour is an outdated system that takes money off of your sales dollar amounts so you have to fight even harder for your job. Every review or meeting I had with managers was designed to tear down your confidence as a person. I was brow beaten, mocked, and never thanked for hard work. And forget about asking for reasonable accommodations if you are sensitive to their new lighting, they will will try to manipulate you into quitting instead."
bad,"After being a manager for a while and having to choose your job over the important things in life, like family, birthdays, weddings, etc.... it gets tiring not feeling like your appreciated or that your hard work is even getting noticed. Even though you make the schedules for your department upper management will still tell you to come in for various reasons. You get 1 weekend off in the month, and they take that weekend away if your associates don't make their ""credit app"" goals. How is It my associates fault that there is no one in the store to get to open a credit card?! Now I don't get a weekend and on their review they get point taken away... "
bad,"My experience at Dillard's was dismal at best. While I enjoyed working for the Estee Lauder brand, the atmosphere at Dillard's was toxic and made me hate the company. The managers do not care about you. They only care about your numbers and how your sales affect them. It was highly competitive, but not in a way that encourages the best out of each worker. I can't say enough how much I hated this job, and I was a top seller."
bad,"I'm thankful for the job at Dillard's, but the management for the district is very demanding and continually makes visits to the store which puts everyone in a tizzy.  It is a corporate job even though you are working locally.  Corporate doesnot take into account the local economy when reviewing sales and work performance.....you can not sell a product if no one is shopping in the store."
bad,Unrealistic goals and expectations. unprofessional management. Unprofessional employees. Worst retail job i have ever had. Lots of favoritism and bullying.
bad,I will never work for this company again.  It was such a competitive environment that most employees did not make friends & few seemed happy.  The sales goals were so high few achieved them.
bad,"Harassed by a customer who created a huge commotion. No one from management came to help. Two customers helped me leave the store I was frightened for my safety. Employee culture toward sales is toxic. Employees treat each other rudely to make sales, customers don't know why we are all over them to make sales. Poor atmosphere to work in. Don't make sales they will cut your pay."
bad,"Dillards will strip you bare of a personal life.  Be prepared for open to close shifts with no regard for you as a person."
bad,"I have been working for the company only eight months. They paid really well for a retail store; however the managers treat their employees a second class citizens. Their system is to make your quota weekly or you'll lose your job. So you have to compete with five other employees in a department. This would caused a dramatic scene, and start harassing each other. I've been bullied and threaten numerous of time at work, when I reported, the managers would tell me to ignore them. Three Floor managers left without saying a word during the eight months of working there. I never felt welcome nor felt safe at the store. I asked several people that worked at Dillard's in Naples, Estero, Fort Myers, and Oviedo about their experience in working in Dillard's. Their answers were the exact to what I said. If you ever shop at Dillard's every single month, you will see there are new employees."
bad,"Horrible place to work! Employees are given completely outrageous & unrealistic sales quotas and are expected to comply or will be fired. No matter how hard or diligently an employee works, Dillard's will fire you if you don't meet their ridiculous sales quota. The management openly chooses favorites. Management enjoys being malicious and very unwilling to help. The co-workers are all cut throat with one another because everyone is so desperate to meet sales quota. This made for an uptight animosity filled work environment which was just awful. Even customers felt uncomfortable because the workers are so pushy and aggressive because, again, they are desperate to meet sales quota in order to keep their job. Awful awful awful company to work for. You will hate life if you work here. Managers come into the break room and turn the lights off on you if you take your break too close to closing (which was 2 HOURS before closing.)"
bad,Workplace was not very motivational. Managers where always never to be found when needed. The store was filthy and never stayed up to date compared to its competitors.
bad,If you value your family this is not the place for you. very strict on quotas and that's all they really ever care about. you get testers and other free products for getting people to apply for credit cards.
bad,The management team are most of the time hired not with in the company. so we have poor advancement opportunities The associate to manager relationship is non-exsitantent  The managers hired do not have people skills at all.in my option they are poorly trained  unrealistic expectations for sales quota's pay cuts following termination Dillard's is a terrible place to work and i wouldn't recommend working there to anyone
bad,This company does not care about the employee's. They will work the Associates and Managers six or seven days a week without proper compensation and breaks.
bad,"Dillards focuses on sales more than it does on making the customer happy. Employee's are encouraged to follow customers around the store, to hold items to force customers back to their department and to take possible sales from other associates. If you are unwilling to follow these encouragements you will find yourself looking for a new job very quickly."
bad,This company overworks their employees without any second thoughts. There is no chance to advance within the company. Th pay is terrible. Management is selfish and self centered
bad,"hunt people own to make a sale, clean all day, very boring job. The manager was a very mean woman. The hardest part was making a sale, the enjoyable part was coworkers"
bad,"In my experience and that of those I worked with and those I talked with that used to work there, there is a disconnect from the highest level/top down - total lack of acknowledgement that employees are human beings.  On the up side, if you just want a paycheck for showing up, some departments will work for you.  They set unrealistic quotas based on past years and do not allow for current financial atmosphere.  Great job to catch up on reading if you are anywhere but main first floor.  They will sell you a line about job description and possibilities and then slowly renege on every detail they told you.  They lie like a rug.  Their corporate office is continually in the top 10 worst places to work and those individuals visit the stores regularly.  Run, don't walk, in the other direction away from this company.  They have cut so far back on advertising and have so little budget, that if you are a manager, you will be expected to invest your own resources for their marketing events.  Severely understaffed and revolving door turnover rate.  In addition, you will be expected to sign an agreement to mediation so that when they violate your basic human rights you have little to no recourse.  PLUS, they will dock your pay if you don't meet their insanely unrealistic sales goals when they assess your performance.  The upside is that no policy is enforced consistently.  Best way to work here is show up, do what you can at your own pace and keep quiet.  There is more back stabbing and rumor mongering than a southern beauty pageant!"
bad,"this is a place i would not refer anyone too. this place has horrible management, horrible bonus program. they have goals that are unreachable and they treat you like you have not feelings or like you are a dog. retail is retail but no one deserves to be treated inhuman."
bad,I enjoyed working here I enjoy retail and helping customers. I really like setting up floor and wall displays. I enjoyed helping young ladies find and create there perfect outfit.
bad,"Typical day at work, you try entering the employee door on time, but the office is known for not opening it when you ring the buzzer for 5 mins no matter if its raining snowing ex. During the day, your miss treated by management and you never know what you will get into trouble for since policies change hourly. Be expected to work 10 hours with a half hour break one day then for 5 hours with an hour break. If your manager makes a mistake on your schedule, remember it is your fault of their incompetence and you will be required to take a two hour break as to not go over your hours and so you leave at the time your scheduled, instead of leaving an hour early. Stock and products hardly come in, so if you can get past managements constant yelling about how we aren't making numbers, even though you have nothing to sell, you have to then deal with the costumers who are disappointed you don't have their favorite products. "
bad,"The dock associates there who wanna be dock associates and aren't really looking to move to the sales floor gets no type of respect as a dock team and what they do for the store, which is almost everything. There aren't any awards or ""job well done's"" on any day of the year. No type of recognition and you barely even get a ""good morning"" from the associates and you'll never get one from the managers. They literally walk right in the building past the dock every morning and won't say anything to the dock team which i personally think sets the atmosphere throughout the rest of the store. The dock team is never invited to any award meetings or party's but only if we help and serve the guest and associate. It would've been nice to feel like the store was a team in its entirety and not segregated by the job and job titles of us and others."
bad,"Not recommended, people warned me I wasn't going to like it and they were right!"
bad,"Everyday your managers would come in to tell you how bad your doing and how bad the department is doing. They have it set up to where you battle your co workers for sales/ customers because if you don't keep your SPH (sales per hour) up they give you 30 days until your fired. My personal SPH was $210.00/ hour. Then times that by how many hours you worked for the day which is typically 8, so $1680.00/ day times the days per week you work. It adds up and they aren't very forgiving. They had let my co worker go after 18 years of working for Dillard's because of her SPH. You are constantly arguing over customers, and who was talking to them first, it was not very healthy."
bad,The co workers are cool. Management sucks. They come up with rules and tactics that are not even in the handbook. Maybe they are not a bad company but my experience working in the Davenport Dillard's was horrible. My advice to management is quit having a dictator mentality.
bad,"There is extreme stress to open credit cards and meet sales objectives, which they set for each employee.  Whether you work diligently, are dedicated and dependable, they decrease your salary if you do not meet your sales objective.  There is no advancement opportunities.  Supervisors are curt and impersonal and talk down to employees."
bad,When I first started I loved the job. As a day shift employee it seemed laid back yet fun. Then I was there a little longer when I learned it was the most stressful job ever. They create high sales goals for employees to attain which made associates act like frenzied sharks hungry for sales. Very tense work environment! Then when u don't meet your goals they reduce your pay. Very stressful. The management is inflexible and very disrespectful and taunting to employees as well. They accommodate certain ppl but most definitely not black people. Thanks Sam Donaldson!
bad,"I lasted a whole 3 months in this position, and I started hating my job only one month into it--all starting with the store manager. He was consistently RUDE and playing favorites with the RUDE sales managers while treating us others like we were disposable. He was horrible at holding disrespectful sales associates accountable for their wrongdoings and instead took out his frustrations on us sales managers. Please reconsider applying for a position here in this store; several of the sales managers will be leaving their positions as well (which says a lot considering the higher base salary.)"
bad,"Morale is low, sales standards are impossible to  maintain.  Managers dont care about associates, just about the numbers that they can get.  will not work with schedule,"
bad,"poor team environment"
bad,bad place to work its only about your numbers. they change their staff every 6 mnths
bad,"I managed the Estee Lauder counter and had a team of 3 other ladies including me.  The team of ladies was great but management is very unprofessional and there is virtually no training program.  I was only a long list of Business Managers at the Estee Lauder counter who have been unhappy there and left.  The hardest part of the job is working 6 days a week including nights and weekends for very low pay.  I met the sales goals most of the months that I was there but for Town East Mall, those goals are unrealistic.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other ladies on my team, the customers, and cosmetics.  Estee Lauder is a fabulous line, just dont care for Dillard's."
bad,"No matter what location or area you work in, the experience is universal. Everyone's days are consumed by sales goals. There are no stock people, so sales reps perform their job start to finish. Training is non-existant. Management was dishonest and would steal from the store with no action when reported up. Management would curse at sales reps on the floor in front of customers. Tenured sales reps become ""sales sharks"" and create a hostile work environment. Management discouraged taking breaks and lunches so you don't miss a sale. During the holidays overtime is mandatory. Guaranteed every day, you come home exhausted and dripping in sweat. The company hasn't invested in its people since the original Mr. Dillard passed away in 2002. This company has no values in practice."
bad,"A typical day at work included counting cash registers (either open or close), selling merchandise, meeting daily sales goals, and scanning and ticketing markdowns. The most important aspect was sales. I learned many sales tactics and how to effectively close a sale. Management was horrible. I had endless problems with scheduling and needed to get my schedule fixed every month. My department manager completely ignored my school schedule and would schedule me to work while I was in class. The store manager is the most disrespectful person I have ever met, and her management tactics were not effective. My co-workers were great, as long as you did not ""steal"" one of their sales. Everyone bonded over the fact that the job was not enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was continuing to stay respectful when management was treating you like a kindergartener. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid weekly, and the rate of pay."
bad,"I don't have a lot of good things to say about Dillard's.  For a student, it was nice because they would work with my class schedule.  My department manager was great, but the store manager was not friendly and would take out his aggression on the employees (he is no longer working for the company).  Benefits were not reasonable, and really expensive.  For a National Company, I would have thought that they had a national benefits plan so that insurance would have been affordable, but that was not the case.  My pay was hourly, but I also had a sales per hour goal that was unreasonable to meet and they would staff sections with more employees than what was needed, so everyone was fighting to meet their own goals."
bad,"Very Poor, can not hold on to workers and over-worked with little pay."
bad,Dillard's does not value their employees and need to consider a complete restructuring of their business plan and motto. They do not have that latest technology and systems are structured to aid the associates in failing.
bad,"A typical day consisted of helping and greeting customers, cleaning fitting rooms, handling markdowns, and covering areas when needed."
bad,overseeing all facets of a typical retail day....coworkers were great management was difficult to handle hardest part of the job was the lack of training most enjoyable was event planning
bad,"Management is terrible, never heard of a retail store that does pay cuts. "
bad,"I had a horrible manager, as in many sales environments, employees are pitted against one another, rather than working together. Altough income is a base pay, if one does not reach their daily quota (which is nearly impossible to reach in such a small town as Shawnee, OK), one faces demotion and possibly termination."
bad,Planning daily goals/staff
bad,Management only cares about sales not about their employees. Sales quotas are beyond ridiculous and almost impossible but if you dont meet that sales goal they let you go.
bad,"Having other associates talk back and bad about others, sense of urgency , no standards as far as management, no hard part about the job"
bad,A typical day at work was waiting on sales hoping people came in to buy instead of returning items. I've learned that retail has its ups and downs especially due to sells. I loved my supervisors they did anything they could to help me in any areas of my job. I met alot of people from different walks of life. The hardest part of my job was to try and keep my sales up with no returns. The most enjoyable part was I met some really nice people and our discount!
bad,"Constant employee turnover. Almost total lack of appreciation for anything done well there from perfect attendance, merchandising, credit card sales (so important) or making your sales per hour."
bad,"Expect to work extra hours with no compensation. Employees are treated as if they are disposable. Promotion takes an act of God, because people don't leave. Company is managed by 2 different thought processes. There is no common goal for this company. Benefits are incredibly expensive and unaffordable for a family."
bad,"Dillards management is so shallow. They could care less of anything other than daily goals and the CAD (client list system) which is so dated it takes 5 screens to fill out information on 1 client. I had just won a Lancome Elite award which honors the top 5% in sales in Lancome nationwide, yet I was fired for not using their computer system correctly."
bad,"If you do not mind the constant employee turnover for a number of reasons, Dillard's may be OK for you. You'll have to keep training new people in your dept."
bad,"salaes associate, making sure the store looks good and clean things are displayed nicely and having great customer service."
bad,This place was to closed in. I enjoyed more of the work; but i felt that i was in school and that schedules kept me in hardship
bad,Terrible Retail Store to work for. NO job security and management was awful. I was promised alot of things and did get a promotion but in other city and I had to do all the leg work. Regional Manager would come in and would never even acknowledge the employees on sales floor. I would never recommend Dillards to anyone.
bad,"When I worked for this company we had a co-worker have a heart attack at work. The company then wrote her up for leaving early that day. Give me a break! They also start you at high pay and give you sales goals that noone can make, then drop your pay. No in-store discounts either."
bad,"I have never experienced such an awful work environment. The managers were sexist and discriminated against a gay co-worker. They didn't give me my wedding day off (I clearly called out that day). Our area manager yelled at co-workers on the sales floor in front of customers, and no matter how many times/people reported the terrible stuff this manager pulled, the store manager and assistant store manager defended him and lied saying that no one else had complained about him therefore they couldn't/wouldn't do anything. They also tried to fake my co workers two weeks to force or bully her into quitting. Another co-worker who had worked there for 2+ years and had made pay-setter(made more than all the managers), and was the highest selling employee in the district was fired for the dumbest thing they could find to get rid of her. They don't tolerate people who stand up for themselves or their co-workers. I promise you, it isn't worth the money. They couldn't pay me enough to be treated as badly as they treated us."
bad,"The job is very unprofessional! You have to make a certain amount of money everyday and if you don’t reach that amount by time your review is, you get fired!"
bad,Unrealistic sales goals for a company that does not advertise.  Corporate needs to be restructured or taught how to stay current with marketing trends.
bad,Had to drop out of school because they stopped working with my school schedule. Didn’t pay commission at all. The commission we made went towards deficit but they made the quota so unreasonable and unrealistic that everybody was in deficit. They had us fighting like sharks to make a sale. Only good thing was a hour lunch break but that was iffy sometimes too.
bad,"Rather than having a department sales goal each individual has their own sales goal. You are competing against your friends to meet your assigned sales goal with is usually unattainable. The coworkers that you work with usually dictate whether or not you will enjoy the job. If you have cooperative coworkers the job will be a lot easier than if you have coworkers fighting against each other for sales. This store in general doesn't get very much traffic and i feel that retail in general is diminishing due to amazon and other online sellers. Dillards items are very overpriced, you can purchase the exact item at another store for a lot cheaper."
bad,"Get in and get out!!  Don't stay more than a year or two here.  It's a waist of time.  Even if you build your clientele base, they'll often not be loyal and shop with other sales people."
bad,"This place would be ok to work at but the management is horrid. The store supervisor/manager has zero people"
bad,"I worked at Dillard's for a few month months full time and it was the WORST job I've had. you have to meet extremely unrealistic goals. The managment doesn't pay any attention to personal availability nor accomplishments. You get reviews month to find out how you are doing with your numbers and you are supposed to have 1 year before your position is on the line, they gave me ONE MONTH."
bad,This store is full of depressed employees trying to earn a living by making impossible sales goals and being threatened daily by incompetent managers.
bad,Very hostile work environment  because we have sales per hour standards to meet. I was a business manager and i was promised everything and received none of it.  The store manager is very two faced and talks about associate and other mgrs.  I quit...terrible place!!
bad,Working at this location was rough. It wasn’t very busy at this store but it did have its moments. The sales goals were unrealistic in my department. How am I supposed to meet a certain quota when it’s not busy in my area. They constantly reminded me of it but no solution was resolved. I even asked to be moved to a different department my first month of working there and was denied. My pay was cut without me knowing. Be prepared to work 12 days in a row with no days off during sale weeks.
bad,"Company sales goals daily unrealistic Sales associates disgruntled.  Management miserable, Morale  Low, Culture bad"
bad,"Constantly threatening about sales goals and pay cuts, lack of company culture and no sense of team, and little support from management, are just the tip of the iceberg."
bad,Not a long term job because you can be fired anytime due to their policies. Not a relaxed environment. Fighting amongst associates due to sales. Enemity amongst staff.
bad,"Don't apply, they don't care about their employees. They made difference between the employees. Being a head cashier they pay low rates to be responsible for all the draws and the safe!!"
bad,"I was hired and was asked if I would try working in lingerie for a week even though I had wanted accessories. I agreed but told the manager who I made the ""deal"" with that I didn't like that department"
bad,There is so much I could say about the things that I don't like about Dillard's. Poor management. Poor Security. Not enough training. I could go on. Not happy with the goal standards. Things could be run a whole lot better. They are rated poorly for a reason.
bad,Sad establishment! They have you in computation with your co worker managers tell your private conversations not a pleasant environment. Ours ate all day you request a day they give you the day before your request day they want you to miss doctors appointments not compassionate about their employees.
bad,The manager's have a attitude when you need help. Store manager walks right past  you without speaking.  Asst. Store manager does the same. I have Never worked with these type of Managers. They are Rude!! And the way they tlk 2 u is Ridiculous.  They Must be Unhappy in the re own life! That is So Sad. I don't wanna  be a part of it.
bad,It’s a highly stressful place where you have to meet unrealistic quota goals each day and if you don’t meet certain sales per hour then you get your pay cut or fired.
bad,"No loyalty and management is horrible and they sit in their office all day! They will screw you even if you have worked there for 30 years, they just dont care! They hire people that are not even qualified for their position"
bad,Dillard’s does not accommodate new mother’s. Will work you all day from 10-9  knowing you have a small child when there were certain people who got off early so it wasn’t impossible. Some days went without break or lunches. Would lock us in the building at closing until they chose to open door while we had already clocked out! Managers would hire new co- workers who already had commitment with other  jobs and still not accommodate their schedules. Unrealistic sales quota for a area that barely gets business.
bad,"I was hired for a commissioned sales position. I was under the impression the client base and traffic would be a bit better. This company is going under very quickly, the only time you see a decent amount of traffic is during their extra 30%-40% off clearance sale. Little or no advertising. Then the draw system is basically designed in their favor, so they have an excuse to put you in ""deficit"" and lower your rate of pay. "
bad,I worked for dillards for almost a year. In this time I was pregnant and they couldn’t care less about me or any of my associates. I read a review on here titled the same as mine and it was accurate as can be. I am not one to rant so I’ll keep it short and sweet.... A COMPANY WITH NO HR DEPARTMENT DOESNT CARE ABOUT YOU!
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to a homeless person.  Management lies to employees just to get them in the door. Nine out of ten times, if you have a background in sales, you will get a job at Dillards. They pay more than regular retailers, but at the end of the day,  the stress and expectations it comes with aren't worth it. Also, you get watched under a microscope daily and can get fired for petty things. Sales quotas are entirely unrealistic! I mean, almost impossible! Expect to not have a life, unannounced changes in schedule at last minute, and unfair and illegal treatment."
bad,"This place is ridiculous. I felt like I was in high school again. Management is horrible!!! When I first began I witnessed a customer that was mistreated by an employee and the customer stormed out screaming she was never coming back. I told management about how the employee mistreated the customer and I was told "" he pays me to sell shoes, not be a psychiatrist to the customers"" ""I need to focus on selling shoes only"". So that shows you a little bit on how much they truely value your business. The last straw for me was being told by management I'm about to be pay reduced because I dont sell enough. And I'm only worth $8.44 if they were to pay me what I really sell. I found this highly unprofessional due to my department is usually ran by 3 employees in the mens shoe department and 1 manager, at that time it was just me running the department with a bran new employee to train while the manager went on a 10 day vacation. This new employee was stealing product. He was coming right in and walking out with what ever he wanted and management did nothing!!! But tell me to try to get this activity on camera, in order for them to be able to fire him. Then he gets a customer that gives him weed and in exchange he dicounts the product for him. And heard them talk about the next time he came in they would do this again. I watched this happen and I went straight to security and managemnt and they tell me sorry its not on camera they cant do anything. At this point I'm thinking about my safety even working here anymore. They wouldnt even let me move departments to get away from this new"
bad,My time spent at Dillards consisted of many stressful tears. There was unrealistic goals set for every day. The manager was never consistent with schedules (or knowing her employees names). I was so overworked between work during the holidays while trying to juggle school that I was literally sick.
bad,"I worked here for 3 years and recently was let go due to sales. That is all they care about- they do not care if you’re a great employee and come in on your days off to help with mark downs or transfers, etc. they only care that your sales are the highest in your department. This company really screwed me and many other people over. Do not work here. If you want a sales job, go to Macy’s or Nordstrom where they treat their employees well."
bad,"Job is designed to fail.  Job is tied to reaching sales goals set by company.  Employees have no idea where those goals that change daily come from.  Employee has no control over what shifts are assigned,department assigned or ability to work sales shifts during which sales skills are replaced by just ringing up customers and bringing in larger daily sales volumes--gravy sales.  Some shifts and departments bring few sales from low traffic, but goals are the same as people assigned better shifts or departments worked.  If you reach goal your pay goes up making sales goals higher.  If shifts change sales go down and your pay is lowered and later you are fired.  If shifts stay the same eventually you can't sell any more per hour and get fired.  "
bad,"management is terrible and lazy, managers talk bad about employees and act very unprofessional, people hate working here so they are all very rude, sales quotas are almost impossible to achieve but you’ll be terminated if you’re not meeting goals, turnover rate is INSANE. pay is good but that’s the only good thing about working here and if goals are not met, pay will be docked. don’t waste your time working here. worst decision of my life."
bad,"Poor management,no meeting with associates ,no gretting i d'ont recomande any one to work there."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend it to a reasonable person. The pay is excellent, but there's a catch to that. You have to meet a sales goal and if you don't they will cut your pay or fire you. It doesn't matter if you're a good employee or not."
bad,Would not truly reccommend.  Management is rude.  Company doesnt really care about a work life balance.  They bully you around.  I would recommend only working here temporarily.
bad,"Company does not care about employees, except to have new fresh faces every 6 weeks or so. The sales goals are sometimes outrageous to meet. It's also very high school clique ish. If you don't brown nose the right people, they will make you feel unwanted and down right hated so you leave or they will fire you for whatever reason they choose. The cosmetic area was great to work for, with all the training and free products offered from which ever counter you work for. Dillard's as a company is even ranked one of the top 3 worst companies to work for! Don't believe me, Google it!"
bad,"After 20 plus years, I was terminated. No fault of my own, except that I stayed with them too long. They'll turn and burn, unless you're young and dumb."
bad,"I enjoyed my regular customers. I would show them the new colors of the season, new arrivals, have them try different styles and make my sales. Management does not ever go and check on associates.  They bring us the directives for the different brands and we set them up.  The hardest part is lack of workers on different areas, than we have to bring out the new merchandise and remove the bags, hand and reset in areas. They have very few people working on the dock, so if we want our merchandise we have to go back there and bring it ourselves. I enjoy interacting with customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
bad,"NEVER WORK AT A DILLARDS. yes, the pay is amazing and very liveable but it’s honestly not even worth it when being fired is a constant threat and fear every single day. the sales quotas are ridiculously high, $1200 on a week day, and if the quotas are not met at an average amount then you will be terminated without warning. Obviously, this creates a very hostile environment with coworkers and makes it absolutely impossible to make friends at work (which sucks because i worked 10 hours a day every day). my managers we’re power OBSESSED and choose their favorites. I was not a favorite simply because one of their favorites, hated me. there is NO winning in this company. You will NEVER come out on top. average ratio of employees getting fired A WEEK is about 3."
bad,"Threatening pay cuts if quotas weren't met, and giving unrealistic quotas, really quick training the day before the Dillard's family would show up. The job was just exhausting!"
bad,"Every single dillards has some of the worst managers in the higher ups. If they do not like you they will do anything for you to leave. You will receive write ups for something you did not do, is not a rule, or is random that they explain to you differently. This company is the most insecure job you could ever have, especially as a person of color. The favoritism is suffocating. You will get fired or have to quit. Not worth the good pay check! They will set you up for failure, without a doubt if they do not like you. And trust me, they like few people. And still screw over the people they ""like"" that are loyal because they're tired of you."
bad,"Starting pay is nice, but if you don't make $400/day, you get fired!! Dillard's employees are mean, they want their commission, or you are fired!!"
bad,"don't care for you, you are just a number to them, not flexible with your schedule, no organization rules made up as you go, no type of structure, they don't even have a HR department"
bad,"Out-dated selling practices, favoritism in the workplace.  High sales quotas which causes associates to fight over sales.  Lack of security in the store which causes high theft in all departments."
bad,"I was told lie after lie that I could advance easily and once I was hired, they told me it would be years before I moved up at all. Management is horrible and picks favorites. Sales goals are almost impossible and you get pay reductions if you don't meet them."
bad,"pay is good but management is awful.  They like to see associates argue over petty things ""it creates a competitive environment"" the customers are usually very nice"
bad,"If you don’t know much about Dillard’s, it is a nationwide department store that has a lot of outdated and overpriced styles. Working for Dillard’s was a tough job. I didn’t mind working with people, but I could barely have small talk with my coworkers during slow times. My department was neat and organized but because of the high sales quotas I rarely reached my goals. There wasn’t near enough customers in that store to reach some of the sales goals they put forth, and because of this it made my coworkers hostile towards each other and if you didn’t meet your sales goal one day, it would triple your next target. Overall I am very displeased with my time there."
bad,the pay is great! but the company cares more about the numbers than the satisfaction of clientele. hard on employees for sales goals. i feel as though there are more encouraging ways to motivate an employee to strive for higher goals than to punish them for not meeting them every day.
bad,"Very poor store Manager not professional at hall"
bad,Stressful. Favoritism. No good training for any departments. Poor communication especially with managers. Bathrooms are disgusting. Favouritism is a big thing there. Co-workers are very nice and help each other out as mich as they can. But very poor management.
bad,"I can not speak for the whole of the company. I will say this about this specific location, I feel that this could be a wonderful place to work where it not under the current store manager."
bad,there are many things i did not like about dillards they make sales goals too high for any new employee to get a raise. it is based on hours worked so if u wanna make a change to ur schedule they do not adjust sales based on ur change even though you meet all requirements.
bad,"Very stressful and competitive; no time for quality customer service. No time off, working nights and week ends. Management was chaotic and unclear on procedures and set unattainable goals of sales; with threat of reduction in salary."
bad,"horrible place to work"
bad,Not a good place to work at all. People would still your sells all the time. Management was rude 90% of the time. They would not encourage employees to do better. Training was terrible also. Training was not good at all. Bad energy all over the store.
bad,"Extremely poor management, high stress. Pay raises dependent upon sales goals: if you miss your goal, pay is reduced by $1+ for one year; if you exceed your goal, pay is increased $1+ for one year, BUT your sales goal is raised exponentially; eventually even the most successful sales associate has a sales goal so high it's impossible to meet, leading to a pay cut despite high sales numbers. It's Dillard's way of keeping their expenses down. It also leads to a cut throat atmosphere on the sales floor and a very poor work environment."
bad,Dillard's is a cut throat work place that reminds you how easily you can lose your job. While Dillard's is losing customers the managers put unrealistic expectations on sale associates.
bad,I loved working in the cash office but  they do not offer full-time. The sales floor was insane. You have to merchandise everything and maintain a sales goal which is not possible for anyone. My manager was amazing and would apologize daily for the corporate requirements. 9 out of 10 employees do not make it over 6 months on the sales floor. The turnover is unbelievable. They have a divide and conquer mentality. If you start to get along with your co-workers and divide tasks they will separate you or create some imaginary drama. They want a cutthroat environment and do not believe in teamwork.
bad,"The management is horrible you never see them, I worked there two years and only had a review at 30 days. I liked most of the co-workers except it was highly competitive for sales to try and meet your sales goal.  There was no incentive to meet our sales goal only that we got to keep our job if we made it.  If you fail the first year to meet your sales goal they cut your pay and if no improvement you are let go with no warning, they don't even let you know you are failing or that your pay was cut. I can honestly say I didn't learn anything since no management was ever present to teach us anything or never corrected us on any errors since they didn't like confrontation."
bad,"I was a certified lingerie specialist and I loved the job itself — helping people first hand was always something I enjoyed to do — but the management was so atrocious it made working there a living h*ll. I basically went to work to get yelled at & it wasn't just me, it was with every single one of my coworkers. They don't talk to or with you, they talk at you (if they're even talking, it's usually shouting). It's a competitive environment and the managers always found it fun to pit sales associates against each other. I truly hated working for Dillard's."
bad,"You never knew what you were walking into day to day. Every level of management is always looking for someone else to blame in regards to the whole companies poor performance.  You will never be recognized for goals accomplished, because store management is very desperate for recognition from corporate management. Management will literally take credit for everything good and blame others for everything bad! The company focuses on what everyone at every level is doing wrong on a daily basis. The morale of the company is very demanding and very draining. Life is to short!"
bad,"management has no clue how to relate to employees , must be on the inner circle in order to advance in this company I worked for the company for 11 years the only increase in pay I received was when I changed job positions and the increase was minimal"
bad,"They take you pay down if you down make high sales goals."
bad,"Terrible place to work at, benefits are terrible, management could care less about you, the goals set you up for failure so that when they fire you its an easy excuse. high turn over rate"
bad,"Dillard's management think that they OWN you.  They are very unwilling to work with your personal life and are flat out disrespectful and RUDE! For example, if you had family problems going on and needed to switch to part time, they are NOT hearing it,. They will basically tell you either continue to work 38.5 hours a week or find a new job. Or if you get sick and hospitalized for more than a few days they will let you come back but FIRE you within a weeks time frame because you're ""undependable"". Also, management always sends multiple threatening emails to all of the employees on the sales floor throughout the week. Plus, you get  no credit for trying or for slight improvement.  You could be the #1 seller in your district 1 week and no one would say anything but they are quick to write you up and once again threaten your job if one week your SPH (sales per hour) is low.  And the insurance is garbage. Don't work here if you can avoid it."
bad,I love working with people. I would like to be appreciated for my skills and transfer that to employees who will work for you if they feel that their managers respect them and treat them in a way that makes them love their job.
bad,"Dillard's sales associates are on a sales per hour quota, which can make your work day stressful and tense with your coworkers as you all are struggling to meet your daily personal sales goals. It's a shark tank there. Dillard's has created an anomosity filled atmosphere between coworkers. If you fall short of your sales goal before your performance review, Dillard's will CUT your pay by as much as $2.00 on the hour."
bad,At Dillard's most of their jobs are commission. The jobs that are paid jobs are difficult and stressful. Their management is always looking to let someone go so they can save money. The office work there can be demanding and your co-workers will always be looking for the chance to make your life difficult or get you canned.
bad,Beautiful spa and good learning experience not the best environment and management was very questionable typical day clock in and welcome people in for there services coworkers were ok the hardest part of the job was advertising
bad,"This is a great place to meet new people, Dillards has many new employees in and out the door, therefore it will be hard not to meet new people."
bad,"I worked at this store for a year.  I loved my customers and enjoyed helping them ""shop"".  However, the store manager is a terrible person and most of the department managers aren't much better.  If you request to be ""off"" on a weekend, you are penalized by being scheduled for 10 days in a row!  Dillard's ""daily sales quota"" for every Sales Associate is unrealistic considering that 1 in 100 people who walk through that particular store actually buys anything.  It also perpetuates jealousy among co-workers.  Worst company ever!  Better to go somewhere else to be a salesman/woman."
bad,"Management requires day off requests to be made by the 7th of the month prior, but doesn't give entire month schedule consistently.  Many times you only get 1 wk schedule at a time issued the week before.  No life.  You are REQUIRED to get credit apps (amount decided by Management) or be put on credit app table.  Your days off vary every week.  Be prepared to work ""rounders"" (from 9:35am to 9:20pm) depending on whether store is ""shorthanded"".  Rules are inconsistent.  Favoritism is common."
bad,"This is a company good for short-term work. They pay well however, there is no oppotunity job advancement. The work culture and overall company ethic, is verypoor. The company as a whole lacks ethics and moral values. There is no job security or protection for their employees. Its a waste of time unfortunately to go to HR when you are being harrassed or mistreated, I guess they are not big on handeling the misconduct of their management staff. Its very unfortunate. I thought it was an isolated case at my particular store, but upon further investigation I realized its a very common complaint with this company.  Also I noticed just as a minority ,that they aren't very friendly to people of color."
bad,"you get to know alot of people , meet customers , become their family but there is no advancment in the company"
bad,"They pay good for a retail job ,but if you want to move up in the company be prepared to move at a drop of a hat to just fill a space . Promotions have noting to do with the direction you want to move in your career ,but the need to fill a position. There is practically no training for associates or even managers. Dont believe their lies for advancement or to be moved in the practically impossible to get into buying office ,unless you look like a model."
bad,"I received my personal satisfaction from helping customers to find what they needed for different occasions, not so much for reaching store goals for sales.  I learned early on, never to lie to your customers, always tell them the truth and they will seek you out when they need something else.  "
bad,"You work on a quota everyday and it is nearly impossible to meet. Co-workers steal your hard earned sales and management does nohing about it when they are suppose to. if you have a problem with the computer, customers, markdowns, ect, don't call a manager because they will give you a hard time for taking them away from there coffee break. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sales per hour. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,Great starting pay but overall poorly run. On-site Human resource manager would greatly help the company to succeed.
bad,It is a job that wants you to fail and takes the fun out of you and your work.
bad,"Dillard's starts you out with a decent hourly, however you are given an extremely high sales per hour you must maintain to keep that hourly wage. Mine for example was $147 per hour, that is all day everyday, then they over hire, so you will be in a small area with 9 other people fighting you for sales, and they will aggressively fight you for every sale. If you don't make this ridiculus sales goal daily, it carries over to the next day, the next week and before you know it you are $15,000 in the red, so when you get your review in 3 or 6 months you get a $1 per hour pay cut. If in 3 months you aren't able to redeem your sales you will get another cut, it's crazy."
bad,this is a terrible place to work no matter how many years you give them you have no job security if you don't make your sales per hour they take you down in pay. And then they fire you no matter how long you've been there
bad,"Great coworkers, I wouldn’t trust management at all! "
bad,Honestly it was the worst job I have ever had. I would not recommend to anyone. All they care about is numbers and image. As long as you look like your'e doing something it didn't matter. Most of the employees steal and no one cares.
bad,"Never felt so unappreciated. Management rides you constantly about selling more, so we end up trying to find a fine line between helpful and pushy. It causes problems on the sales floor because everyone is trying to make their goals so they don't get their pay cut. "
bad,"Dillard's sets you up to fail. I trained in the children's dept. As soon as my training was over, I was moved into the home dept as a selling business manager. There was no manager  for that dept like yhe rest of the store, so I was on my own.  One older lady on my team was having trouble making her goals, so I backed off on sales and let her have more. I didn't know that I was supposed to be meeting a goal also, in addition to all of my managerial duties that I was trying to teach myself as I went along. This lady had been with the company 17 years. She didn't get her sales up in a certain amount of time and they cut her hourly wage. They gave her a target date and told her if she didn't get her sales up by that date the she would be let go. They followed through on that. I was asked if I would like to move to the men's dept. I said yes. Someone in Polo had just retired and hadn't been replaced yet. Polo is the big money maker in men's. One would not have any trouble making your goal.Instead, I was put around the corner from the rest of the men's dept across from ladies shoes. The position in Polo was filled by a star performer in children's. She didn't want to move. Also, when they move you, it wipes out all of your sales for the year. She won an award every year, but this was in November, so she didn't get one that year. Here's where it gets really crazy. If I can't meet my goals, why move me to a worse dept? I got fired."
bad,I worked  there for about 3 months ... i was in a commision dept. and never was able to actually make commision. I walked on average 20 miles a day in dress attire. The AC never worked and had at least 3 customers a day ask me about it.
bad,Dillards by far is the worst company I’ve worked for. Nobody knows what they’re doing because they don’t train us since the turn over rate is so high... Management literally let a woman who bullied my co workers and I stay employed even after she physically pushed one of the older women on the cosmetics floor. She didn’t get fired till they caught her stealing. The attendance policy is trash and just so you know they won’t accept a doctors note even if you are sick you’ll still get an exception. The company clearly only cares about numbers and sees you as number before a person. They’ve scheduled my co workers and I to come in on our days off for a 30 minute credit card class when some of us already drive 35 minutes to get there. You are so much better than Dillard’s I promise you don’t do it.
bad,Run by a tyrannical individual and dangerously incompetent higher ups. Harassment is rampant and wields itself freely throughout the entire place. If you want to have your soul ate go ahead and apply.
bad,Don't bother! It's not worth it! You'll get more appreciation and respect working in fast food! Very toxic and hostile upper management! Backstabbing and backbiting unprofessional people work there! They will lie on you and try to attact your character when you're just trying to do your job.
bad,While I enjoyed my time with Dillards I would not work for them again. I did learn a lot about clothing and and selling clothing. I had worked with people all my adult life so that came natural to me. I enjoy people and enjoy helping them find what they need.
bad,This place will tell you one thing and run you around until you can't Bare it anymore. If you have an issue they won't fix it they will avoid it and move you and tell you to figure everything out. They will tell you that tou need to meet a goal for a certain department and then tell you to meet another goal that you can't even see yourself because they won't change the system to show it. They will make tou into a pack mule and will do anything in their power to use you til you won't work anymore. I feel sorry for anyone who chooses to work here
bad,"Dillard’s was not for me. The culture of the job was not what I was used to. Many things I was not taught. That would’ve helped me with sales. The goals they give you are impossible, and you get threatened with termination of u don’t meet them"
bad,"Infighting condoned...claims of ethical atmosphere,, NOT true... Unethical practices...horrible mngmt. Back stabbing and rudness among employees is rewarded... Hard sell and stealing sales is the culture at Dillard's.. I would do EVERYTHING to discourage anyone from working at Dillard's"
bad,If you like to work under stress then this is the job for you.  They work you like crazy and you have no family  time.  Most of the time you only get one day off a week.  During sales and holidays you will work 10 days straight  without  a day off.  They will fire you if you don't make your sales goal  without  a warning.   I have never worked for a company  that didn't  care about their  employees.   They just care about  having  bodies  in there and making  sales.
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees at all. I am searching for jobs because this one lacks stability, advancement, and flexibility. When you get hired on you have three months then you will be getting reviewed. If you are not meeting their selling standards they will fire you, which is outrageous. They don't like to give you the days you request off. If you're not meeting their selling standards, they also won't give you the opportunity to go to full time. Management also likes to be rude behind your back and they have favorites. Customers are also entitled and rude."
bad,There are no raises. On May last day of employment I learned from several co workers raises are not given after having my review with the store manager. I worked very hard to recieve the pay I was receiving.
bad,"Working at Dillard’s is a mistake waiting to happen. You have daily sales goals to meet, with absolutely no customers to sale to. If you don’t meet those goals, you’ll eventually get a pay cut. Employees are in constant competition with each other to get sales from the very few customers that do come in the store. Needless to say, there’s a lot of lying, backstabbing, and fakeness. The management is awful and very dismissive."
bad,"You are literally set up for failure. Management does not care about your department if it’s not the department that’s making commission like shoes & cosmetics. They will hound you about making your sales goals, pushing customers for credit & even setting up a credit class from 8:30-9:30 in the morning & THEN want you to come back & do your regular shift. You can’t force a customer to get a credit card if they don’t want one. No amount of “training” will help that. Horrible environment to work in & frequent schedule changes without you even knowing about it."
bad,"I legitimately learned a lot working here. That, however, was because of the overwhelming amount of responsibility that is given to the managers of the major departments in the store. As salary, you were expected there on many days off, calls from store management on days off because something had happened in your department on your time off were regular, and the overall mood and tone of the environment was negative. The sales expectations were unfair to the sales associates but were forced to be pushed by us in management or else they would lose their jobs. Everyone here is a replaceable number and corporate and store management will not let you forget that."
bad,"The first few years of my experience as the Michael Kors Handbag Specialist brought me great joy and pride. I took my work very seriously and looked forward to providing excellent customer service. The overall satisfaction of each and every shopper was my number one priority. In addition, I worked daily to represent the Dillard's brand with pride and excellence. "
bad,"The store manager was a good person to work for.  Upper management made life miserable for all of my employees and for me.  Hours weren't that great, but the people I worked with made that better.  I just thought the company didn't care much about their employees."
bad,"No room to move up in the company, management was horrible, no communication between management and associates. Does not care about employees. The best part was the discounts on clothes and accessories."
bad,This is a place to work if you are a teenager or looking for a part time in job college. The sales environment was tough so you had to have a cut throat mentality for a low paying simple job. They hired a lot of college student so employees were always in and out and the leadership was terrible.
bad,"When working for Dillard's, you were expect to meet your sales goals by any means necessary. When and if the goals were met, you were respected and supported by management. However, if the goals were not met, you were approached by management with warnings regarding sales performance. There was always a delicate balance to maintain positive relationships with coworkers due to the shark mentality of staff members. Upper management rarely intervened to keep the peace among the bottom dwellers."
bad,Very Stressful due to management expectations. Management created a very uncomfortable atmosphere and put a lot of pressure on employees to open credit cards and make sales goals.
bad,"There is no such thing as team work. They expect certain tasks to be done. While some of us would accomplish those tasks, others would instead be trying to sell to make their quotas. It was a very unproductive work environment. I would say that I accomplished more tasks daily than the full-time workers who were focused on selling. Often times, I would clean and sort to keep the area presentable."
bad,The company is terrible to work for. They make it hard to not only advance in the company but to just keep your job is hard. They make you work basically as if you work on commission but you make no commission but if you don't reach the number youre supposed to they either cut your pay or fire you.
bad,They expect so much to be done in so little time and without proper equipment to do it all in. They suck they suck they suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Awful awful experience. Employees are catty and steal sales and lie to coworkers and customers. You don't even make commission and the people who work there are ridiculous. I've worked in many jobs and have made commission and people didn't act like that. And do you know why? Because they fire you if you don't make your sales goals. Very difficult place to work with a lot of drama. Managers are rude and not helpful. I quit to pursue a higher education and did not want to deal with the stress of both the job and school work.
bad,"For starters management at the time was ridiculous, they chose favorites and the employees always work their hardest just for the department manager to take full credibility. I learned at this job people are very selfish and competitive. The only thing I liked about this job was making friends with some really nice ladies who put up with this everyday, and still show up with a smile on their face ready to take on the day."
bad,"I worked at Dillard’s for a small amount of time and learned a few things very quickly. The sales goals are ridiculous. Especially around the holidays. Working with two other people behind a counter, there is absolutely no way you all will sell $4,000 in product a day. When you do not make your sales goals, it rolls over to the next day, again and again. In the short time I worked there I was $20,000 behind in sales goals. They give you a grace period but after that’s up, if you aren’t making goals you are outta there! I also noticed it was a very competitive place to work. Which brought out the catty in co workers. They argue over stealing each others sales and customers. I felt like I was back in high school. On top of all that the hours they scheduled me for made it impossible for a second income. All for less than 300.00 a week. Nothing about it made standing around that long for less than $300.00 a week worth my time. Especially when you can work at a restaurant around here and make that much in a 5-6 hr shift. But with that being said their starting pay is higher than most other retail places, they will cut your pay if you do not meet your goals before they fire you."
bad,"Pay is good but management is horrible they can’t don’t anything right but walk around and the job is nice with discount and pay, but the job as far as making a career out of is a no."
bad,"worked here for 5 years and just because I wasn't at my sales quota by my review date I was let go They don't care about your work ethic as long as you're making them money they don't care how you treat customers. There are those who get nothing but complaints and they get a slap on the wrist. Then you have the rest of us who treat every customer equally and they don't care, because if you're not making them sales they don't want you. They could careless. They set such high goals without taking in consideration when there are dead days. Working in a shoe department is a death trap for sure! I'm glad of the experience I gaoned working here but as a company in general. It is the worst place to work."
bad,The job was salary and they would work you about 60 hours per week.  They changed to Business selling Managers which means you as a manager compete with the employees that work for you.  There was always tons of turnover
bad,Corperate has made the work environment so cut throat customer service and internal structure is suffering. Quotas have gotten to hard to meet. People are just not coming in the door. Dillards resolve is to put more associates on the floor. Good workers get fired while 18 yr old kids reap the benefits and Dillards allows this as acceptable practice.
bad,You would come in at 9:45 and have a meeting basically telling you that you had to get credit apps and sales and if not there would be consequences. sometimes we would have mark downs; on the days we didn't we would basically call customers and remerchandise clothing.  This job wouldn't be so bad if your performance was not based off of your sales quota.
bad,"Corporate gives out unrealistic sales quotas that are impossible to meet. Our store was located in a very low income area, yet our quotas were the same as the ones for the associates in the busiest store in the district. If quota isn't met, they cut your pay then fire you. Our store went through associates so fast because of the ridiculous policies that once making it 6 months, associates are considered to be long-timers. In our store specifically, our department managers were fantastic. My department manager was a pleasure to work with. Our store manager however was grossly incompetent in many ways. This man went against corporate directive constantly. He would come in when his department managers were off and completely rearrange entire departments, then threw his associates and department managers under the bus when corporate would do visits and complain about everything that was done wrong. He also got emails from corporate about not allowing associates to reach overtime, because they didn't want to pay us. He would either shave our hours at the end of the week, or for a while he was doctoring time entry slips to make it look like we were only working a set amount of hours, so people weren't getting paid for all the time they worked. He was turned in to corporate, but they did nothing. He also does everything in his power to prevent any form of advancement. Our store was considered a training store. People were supposed to start there, then get moved to another store. Problem was, no one was ever moved from our store. We were all either fired because of not making sales"
bad,"*Most stressful environment for a part time retail job"
bad,They scheduled me during college classes and didn't teach me how to use anything. Threw me under the bus basically. Marion IL Dillards. Very rude.....
bad,"This Company make's the associate to be very competitive among each other.  The expectation is to sell no matter what,  if you don't make your sales goal your pay will be lowered or you will be  terminated.  This company is not compassionate whith their employees."
bad,terrible management and favoritism is high in this store. Requests for anything at that is like pulling teeth. Management for my department is a total joke. drama in my department is pathetic. I enjoy the new department I work in because of its manager and employees.
bad,"If you don't reach impossible sales goals then they threaten you with pay decreases or the fire you.  They don't appreciate the great customer service or upkeep of store and merchandise, only sales. Managers and assistant managers talk badly about employees to employees. There is no recourse for employees.  Complaining only makes you a bigger target.  Gen manager doesn't care about the work environment or that dept managers yell at employees. Don't take this job if you're looking for longevity or respect.  Working under fear of being fired is not worth it."
bad,"You start with a base pay, and whether or not you do a good job of selling you will get a pay cut or pay increase. But dependent on the Dillard's you choose to work at you will get horrible bosses that only care about themselves."
bad,"This company doesn't care about anything other than you making a sale. Everything revolves around sales and cr sit apps. Give them your all and they've got nothing to give back to you in the end. Go back to school, go to Macy's, go anywhere.. just don't apply here. Benefits are a joke and not worth the money. Termination for employees with low sales. Career advancement very possible but not stable. I worked at 3 different stores. Each the same. Turnover rate extremely high."
bad,"I started off working in juniors , I loved the area and customers until they hired this 65 year old lady to mange the department ! It sucked being the fact that I had applied for the position and I knew everything about the area they shot me down. To make a long story short I'm now working in shoes and the lady is not a manger anymore .. I love the people I work with but not the people I work for ! Before I even applied for this store I seen reviews bashing the company I should have listened .. these people don't give a flip about you or your outside life ! I have a 3 year old son who I barely see because of work"
bad,"Poor Management on the Corporate side and in the store I worked in.  The supervision, I received, was good - hardworker.  Their overall policies were out dated (as was all the equipment/technology).  Overall, Dillard's did not respect their lifeblood aka employees and didn't  exhibit much respect to the customer.  The starting pay was better than most retail stores but the sales goals were too high, pay was taken away if you didn't achieve them,  There was entirely too much focus on obtaining credit cards.  The atmosphere in the store rewarded aggressive behavior."
bad,"Upper management doesn't seem to listen to their staff. Working for Dillard's can make you more vocal about the workplace but it leaves a lot to be desired. The pay is great, especially starting out, but the pay cuts come quick if you don't make your goals which are high."
bad,"Horrible bosses,  dirty store,  poor management.  I worked in kids and saw 6 employees leave in one month from kids.  Quota impossible to meet.  Hated it.  They don't tell you the truth during orientation."
bad,I was a sales associate at dillards in clarksville tn. I was working for the mens department. It was a very interesting job. I never had worked managers with poor skills.
bad,"""Sales per Hour"" system needs overhaul and creates strife and discord among other associates.  New management's obsession with opening credit cards has escalated beyond belief.  Management has become more and more disingenuous. Sales continue to drop, and company refuses to advertise, or to offer incentives to customers to open cards. Dillard family continues to shoot themselves in the feet by maintaining ""it worked for daddy, it must be ok today.""  Technology is from the 1990s at best."
bad,"Of course, because this is a retail environment, employees are required to work long hours. Sadly, though, there is often a lack of appreciation for employee efforts, and, for many, there is a lack of job security, as well.  Employees are often treated unfairly. Unfortunately, the overwhelming opinion is that the Dillard's family does not seem to mind that their employees are treated poorly."
bad,"Worst place ever to work. Managers were rude and snotty and favored certain workers. Uneven amount of workload put on one person while the others sell. Unattainable sales quota for the amount of hours scheduled. Managers will promise things and never live up to those promises. Co workers in the department were rude to the customers and co workers, it seemed as if they could care less about their merchandise and job and more about the paycheck they get. The drama, gossip and pettiness in this place isn't worth it honestly. A typical day of work I came in, opened registers, put away merchandise/open merchandise and just do daily chores to keep the department clean and nice looking. It wasn't the job I didn't like, it was the constant starting rumors about me when I called in sick, my manager kept asking a certain co worker whom she knew I was close with on a day where i was out sick for example. I had to do co-workers specialized work for them because they were not trained on it (even though they had the full time position and specialist title for that certain job). The discount and pay was pretty good and it may have just been the department I worked in but it's not for everyone because of the social side of it. If you don't have your own department or are scheduled by yourself that day, most of the time co workers are going to be trying to have a conversation with you, for the whole time you're there. It's a negative environment where people don't want to help each other out and see each other succeed and care more about the drama going on in the workplace than the actual work"
bad,"Poor management judgment, unfair decisions depend of who you were, never felt so discriminated in my life specially by the store manager. "
bad,very hostile i work at this company for 21 years i was very happy and dedicated i was a team leader a team motivator the company had good benefits
bad,"This is the worst job that I've ever had. They seduce you with the high pay, but they do not properly train you. Management is ridiculous and will throw you under the bus to save themselves."
bad,"Greeted and welcomed all customers in a courteous manner"
bad,"The company lacks ambition to grow. This culture trickles down to the employees, who do ""just enough"". The result is a disengaged work force, oppressive managers, and a miserable experience. "
bad,Dillard's is an okay company to work for but remember to be able to make your sales within a certain amount of time be cause if you can't you will not have a job.  You also have to be very aggressive to sell and make your sales.  Other wise the company is nice to work for and the store manager is a wonderful person to work for.
bad,"Dillard's pays well, but due to the lack of decent management and impossible quotas for salespeople, it is a horrible place to work."
bad,If you are looking for a temporary situation that pays good then Dillard's is your place. They have a really high turnover rate because they are more concerned about sales than customer service.
bad,"You sell, sell, sell, sell, sell or you're fired. That's it."
bad,"Will never work for that company again, management was disrespectful."
bad,"Dillard's has created an atmosphere of discontent for their employees as well as management. The sales per hour pits employees against each other, and their is no teamwork. I advise no one to work here until they change their treatment of employees, and management gets some training."
bad,The managers were incompetent and rude. They sell moldy shoes that have just been wiped off. You can tell the difference in the atmospheres as you walk up the stairs. Always had to go to credit card class which was a waste of time. Had to make a sales goal but it never happened because who wants to pay for over priced
bad,Worked in the men's department as a sales associate. High starting pay compared to other retail stores. Sales goals are unrealistic and I got my 30 days notice after 1 month of working there even with meeting the sales goals. Picked up my sales and got 1st raise. Then got 30 days again(against policy I believe)! Had problems with a manager and a co-worker(harassment from both) and got screamed at by general manager. No one in my whole life has treated me like the people in this store. Degrading and juvenile. I stayed 5 months and decided to quit before they could treat me like a dog any longer and fire me for no reason.
bad,"Very efficient and productive place to work, I enjoyed working on ways to improve operations. Skills I have always relied on are treating everyone fairly and making sure that all lines of communication remain open so staff can come to me with any issues or concern."
bad,"Management is a bully. They pin their employees against each other for sales instead of the company working together as team. No one, and I mean NO ONE who works for Dillard’s loves their job. "
bad,MEET your sales goals or you are GONE!! Not much else matters. Not enough customers for everyone to meet sales goals. This creates lots of tension on the sales floor. Also creates lots of tension between the management and the employees. STRESSFUL!!!!!
bad,"This is truly the only job where I have felt dehumanized. Management is on a major power trip, and loves to ""catch"" associates doing things wrong. On the other side of that, they will never praise you for doing a good job. They are constantly talking down to their associates and making them feel small."
bad,"Your sales are tracked, you have a quota to meet in $$ and credit card apps. If you don’t meet the quota you can get docked a 1.00 an hour. It didn’t happen to me, it did happen to coworker(s). If you do well your coworkers resent you. The managers play favorites big time. I believe my coworker accused me of taking their sales, which was not the case at all I was just quicker and friendlier. Miserable job. Loved the customer’s"
bad,"There is no sense of team within that store. You are basically on your own to figure things out. Also, lacking is an equal amount of support through out the entire store. Some departments get more support than others."
bad,"Good for temporary work "
bad,Save yourself. The management is rude and only cares about Dillard’s and not their employees. The hours are very long. The pay is good though. They expect a lot that they didn’t mention in the interview.
bad,Management is something else. They don’t care about employees. Filed a claim about harassment against another associate. And they did nothing about it. All they did was sweep it under the rug.
bad,operates on an employee sales quota system. If you don't make your sales quota your fired. The company doesn't advertise or do anything to bring in customers. It's all word of mouth or email. Business is slow but nothing is done to lower the quota or do away with it period. The dillards family must like to see their long term employees fired because of their lack of promoting the company to bring in sales.
bad,"All promises and no delivery.  Passes up the right fit employee advancement for a co-friend instead. Did not support decisions to go part time while in school to better my life for a child, I was sabotaged by management and without any proof, (I did not steal time) fired me, saying I was gone from my floor for over an hr. (Not true). I would recommend this place to be an Avenue for money and get a real education so you do not get caught up in the pay."
bad,"Manager very bad, unfair way they have for keeping your job in some areas like fragrances and cosmetics. If you don’t make a quota they lower your pay, if you make it they raise the quota! Can only make it during holiday times."
bad,"All they care about is sales goals and not the actual sales associates! The sales goal for part time and full time are the same. In shoes, you get in trouble for not using the exact same black marker to label the new arrivals. Also, they threaten to fire you if you don’t meet your sales goal one time."
bad,Management is just terrible. So much drama with the associates. Not the job to work at if you are attending school. Also they sometimes have unfair scheduling. All part timers are expected to close every day and full timers open through out the week.
bad,"this is by far the most unprofessional work environment I’ve ever encountered."
bad,"Working for Dillard’s in the beginning was a great experience however, after being there for a while it went downhill. The rules and requirements to keep your job was constantly changed and often causing associates who had been there many years to start losing their jobs. They hardly encouraged employees within the company to move up and hardly listened to what associates concerns were. The managers were extremely childish towards each other. The Store Manager was unfit for his job he tend to leave all the hard work to the assistant, taking no responsibility for his actions. Other sales associates were competitive and often rude due to the high demand for numbers. If our quotas weren’t met we’d get written up as if “we didn’t try hard enough” The pay was great but the excessive amount of stress wasn’t worth it."
bad,The entire place is too stressful. The environment sucks and everyone takes it too serious. The pay is not with how much stress this job puts on you..
bad,I have nothing to say because it would be strictly from an emotional stand point and that wouldn't be fair. Although the sales goals are completely unrealistic
bad,"Management is horrible. Favortism, prejudice and liars. Very manipulative. Expect way too much from workers to the point where it is unrealistic. Work environment is mentally draining and toxic."
bad,"I love my Job at Dillards. I love the people that I work with. "
bad,"Your quotas are way to high for anyone to reach their goals and feel like there job is secure. I did not like my ""review"" times because I was always worried or scared that I wasn't going to have a job or get a pay cut."
bad,"Daily expectation is about the same. How strong my leadership skills actually were. The hardest part about the job, was the holiday expectations. The easiest part was the objectives."
bad,"The manager in lady’s shoes in Crestview Hills, Kentucky is one of the most disrespectful managers I’ve ever worked with. She talks down to you, makes you feel dumb, snatch things out of your hand and also is very rude to her employees. I would 10/10 not recommend working at the Dillard’s in Crestview Hills. I would rather work in fast food then go back."
bad,the level of communication throughout the store is ridiculous. our district manager along with her manager has to come visit weekly or every other week.
bad,i managed a counter without getting paid for it. they fired the manager and i was stuck doing her work making $8 less an hour. I did not like this company and will not be back.
bad,"horriable place to work. i had alot of retail expierence. by far the most disappointing place ive worked.No opportuinity to grow within the company.if you dont make your quota they fire you. even when they know you need to pick up your sales they dont help you just let you fend for yourself. some departments are busier than others. depends what month it is.Managers all gossip about you if u call in the next day everyone will know why.i had to make 30,000 in a month and it just was not possible in the small town we live especially after the hurricane."
bad,"You are given an hourly wage, you exceed your sales goal, get a raise. You don't, it gets taken away. Battle each other for every customer's sale by creating an atmosphere to steel someone's customer to ring that sale. No matter how much you worked with a customer, if they get grabbed by someone else and rung up, you're out! It's made to where you have to stalk your customers from start to finish, it's ridiculous! I got the highest sales goal raise one quarter and literally the next was our slowest season but the same goal to be able to keep my raise. I was on track to lose what I scalped for...that was it for me."
bad,"I found dillards to be a generally unhappy place to work that projected immense pressure on its associates. The management seemed intense, and unappreciative of their employees, and showed little to genuine care about their employees."
bad,"Started out great, but eventually everyone shows there true colors. The Store manager and the SBM who recruited me were let go. The Store manager structure is non existent and the sph quoatas make workers turn against each other.  Not a good system"
bad,"high turn over do not recommended ,do not train properly also sales goals is unbelievable and to expect that a  sales person get some many credit apps a month or be fired is unfair"
bad,"I worked for this company for two years. I have been part time and full time. The pay is really good but, not worth what you go through on a daily basis. You are required to pretty much harass customers into getting credit cards with the company. You also have daily sales quotas that are near to impossible to meet with business and the over staffing. The management (at least at my location) turns over way too frequently and is inconsistent. Most workers have a negative attitude and the staff turnover is also very high...for a reason."
bad,"Unrealistic sales goals, big work load when it comes to merchandising, and course you have to sale over priced merchandise.  "
bad,"At first it's great. Give it about 6 months you'll be searching for another job. Management cares about money, that's it. They expect your life to be Dillards. I make my sales luckily, but there's no positivity or recognition for it they just ask for more. They change your schedules and work you long stretches. Sometimes up to 13 days in a row and this isn't occasionally but consistently. Shifts can be up to 12 hours long depending on your department and season. If you don't make your sales they fire you, which I understand that."
bad,"Toxic environment with unrealistic sales goals. Highly unethical and some illegal performance done by lower and upper management. No HR to report to in the instance of filing a complaint. Poor training practices, poor safety practices, and extremely high turnover causes unease in job security."
bad,"A typical day at work would be standing around waiting on customers, sometimes put new stock out, keeping the area neat and clean, etc."
bad,"I currently work at Dillard's in Augusta and it's not what I expected. I took the job due to being payed 12.00 an hour. The expectations of the employees is too much, for instance the sales quota. Note nowadays society looks for deals, they want to find those sales in merchandise including top brands. They don't work around your schedule either, that's a lie‼️I'm in school and they expect me to work 27 hours a week and I'm taking 2 science classes. No way, yeah I liked it at first but it's lame, stressful(which i don't stress over) and it's boring. It's so slow during the weekdays I dread coming to work. It's no fun, currently I'm looking for a new job 👌🏾👌🏾"
bad,"If you do not mind backstabbing coworkers or being despised by all your coworkers as long as you get you sale you might be okay. All that is important to this company is you sales number at the end of the day, if you work in a store that is located in a poor place then you might not do so well. Do not expect to be more than a number to them. I was well liked by customers and coworkers, completed all tasks, received many compliment cards, did well at getting credit applications, however i did not meet my sales goal and was let go due to that fact."
bad,"You are responsible for things in the store that you have no control of. The buyers in the company buy way to much product which forces us to waste time and effort trying to merchandise it without looking horrible. Also the ridiculous amount of product they send stores forces us to do tens  of  thousands of markdowns almost weekly which is a waste of time and labor. There is almost no communication between different levels of management with little to no training, basically a sink or swim mentality. On the upside though if one can survive a year or more there they will be blessed with the skills to do most jobs out there. Sadly the better you do there the more likely they are going to keep you where you are, but constantly lie about upward advancement opportunities. They constantly would change your schedule based on sudden and knee jerk decisions made by upper management, that had little or no relevance to sales."
bad,"They don't care about their employees, politics, favoritisim, racisim, management overall is very poor. if you look it up. dillard's inc. is the #1 worst company to work for. constantly have to force yourself on customers and get credit apps. I've been here for years and it doesn't get any better."
bad,"I worked for this company for 1.5 years. I must begin by saying that this is by far the most miserable job I've ever had. As becoming a manager after 2 months, I believed I had real opportunity for a career with this company. Then reality hit. The management in this company is awful. They offered no assistance in building customer growth. I found myself investing my own money and time into building business, which I had no problem with but never received as much as a thank you. Incentives were offered to some but not all. And most of all this place is a revolving door. They set high sales goals and offer no help to obtain them. The purpose of this is to get rid of people before they get bonuses and pay raises. Before you know it, they will hire some young college kid to do your job for a couple bucks less. If you search online you will find articles on Dillards and how they are in the top 5 for worst places to work."
bad,"Management seem to care more about there ego's and power then they care about there employees.  Top down management style, with no concern for training associates or management.  Speaking up for yourself is considered ""insubordination"""
bad,"Good pay, but management is not trustworthy. Your pay is based on how much you sell. Lots of standing around. Management wants you to call your customers almost everyday, which most customers find annoying."
bad,"This company has no regard for sales associates or department managers. The more you do, the more they expect. The district manager is a tyrant who is rude to dept. managers in front of customers and associates. Four long term managers were fired within a few months. All of them were hard working and well respected. When the district managers visits, the atmosphere is so tense and stressful. When my manager was fired, I quit."
bad,"The work load as a store manager for them was not bad, what was bad about the company is they have the sales people on a sale per hour system in which they cut their pay and even let them go due to poor sales. Sometimes this has nothing to do with the employees ability but due to being placed in bad departments or the store being in a bad location or even the economy not doing good. i worked for them for 11 years and was let go in 2009 due to poor sales in my store, what happened to the economy in 2008 and 2009??? Remember is was bad for all retail stores. I was given no warning of this, I had even received a 2k raise and a 5k bonus just 9 months before though was not give a reveiw. In the 11 years I worked for Dillards only 5 reveiews were ever delivered to me, not reconsistent. When my boss let me go who had only visited my store 4 times in the 9 months previous all he could say was I was in a bad mall and the economy was bad. That is the way they roll. Everyone is expendable 11 years with not one verbal or written warning ever."
bad,I worked for Dillards for 9 years. I felt that they pushed credit applications and quotas to hard.
bad,The department managers are terrible and the store managers are worst! They do not care about your wellbeing or helping you reach their high sale goals. Too many expectations. Very few hours if not full time. They will get rid of you and fire you for anything once they see you aren’t useful anymore. They will also fire you without a warning in advance. This company is terrible and I highly recommend it gets shut down. I wouldn’t advise anyone to waste there time at this company.
bad,They dont appreciate there employee's. They are not family oriented nothing comes before the job an they will make up reasons to terminate you if 1 of management doesn't like you
bad,I've always put 110% into my work but this company has the highest turnover rate I've ever seen. The managers dont care about their own employees they badmouth their employees in front of customers and other management. I have been here for 3 years and it's the worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,"never working there again. did not like the way the teamwork was, super competitive and does not provide a good work environment. very toxic for a lot of new workers. they do not care about employees."
bad,Horrible management lazy as the store manager. Specially that store manager treats her employees like animals. Screams at employees with bad words ect. But no one does anything
bad,"Dillard's upper executives are concerned about one thing only, the almighty dollar. They will be the last big box department retailer standing, but it will be at the cost of their employees."
bad,"They job puts you under a lot of stress,  You have to make a daily quota.  you get one hour for lunch for a 9 hour day, no breaks.  they also put employee against employee to make sales."
bad,"Before actually starting at dillards,  I was excited to start. After being here 2 weeks, I started to see why they lacked employees. This store is so unorganized and they don't comply with federal regulations as far as breaks are concerned. They expect you to work 8.5 hour shifts with no break."
bad,"Heavily sales based. If you're uncomfortable being assertive, or selling, this is not for you. You can risk a pay cut for not meeting annual sales goals. Annual goals are typically unattainable if you do get a pay raise, so that way they can pay cut you next year around. Management lacks communication, and makes employees feel like just a number. I would not recommend this place long term at all. Management will listen to your concerns but the lack of action taken to improve anything will show how much they care. I've also personally seen a lot of false policies pushed onto employees, or ""new"" policies that are only enforced when beneficial for that manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount (which you have to apply for, yes, a credit card.)."
bad,"Not the place for minorities, whether in corporate office or retail stores racism is self evident. No HR Dept... mgmt is disconnected from lower level employees. Horrible office environment, mgmt is not adequately trained on employment ethics or employment law."
bad,"Sales are impossible to meet, corporate doesn't care about associates, they have unrealistic goals, flexible scheduling, overall easy job with few responsibilities"
bad,I probably would still be here if it weren’t for the sh*tty a** management and corporate. I worked in a department  where there was a very high turnover rate. They always wanted to hire someone over there that had no intentions of staying and for most of the duration that I was there a lot of times I would be by myself. So days where there was $500 to $1000 quota was highly unattainable considering there was barely any foot traffic. This job was just too stressful.
bad,The Dillard's Arrowhead location I was employed at provided little to no training and severly lacked leadership.  The GM was rude and unapproachable while feared by employees.  The turn-over was also extremely high.
bad,"I had a great store manager at Dillards.  Corporate management was a different story.  Corporate is out of touch with reality.  The Corporate managing team is a joke.  They travel from store to store disrupting daily business and expecting unrealistic expectations from the management team.  "
bad,Very draining company to work for. You will be depressed all of the time. Your over worked. The manager put the associates against each other. There not family oriented. Only good thing is great pay
bad,I would literally never suggest to anyone to work here. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. When an employee asked the general manager for help it was not given.
bad,"The management is super unprofessional, most don't have degrees, some were promoted because of sales. I would have an opening shift once or twice a month so no time for a social life despite submitting my requests. Sales quotas are ridiculously high at times which make it impossible to meet."
bad,"So many cons to working here. #1 work life balance is a joke. I tell everyone for their own good not to ever go full time. This store will schedule you 50 hours a week for no reason, without warning. If you ever try to talk to them about it, you get shut down. #2 unrealistic sales expectations for the SLOWEST Dillard's I have ever seen. There's just not enough foot traffic to justify the thousands and thousands they expect you to sell. #3 PUSHY Sales tactics encouraged- actually, ENFORCED. Be prepared to have to hassle and chase customers to satisfy management."
bad,Typical day at work was me taking on a larger work load while others were selling and stealing sales. Hard to make sales while getting everything done. I was overworked and way under appreciated. Pay was decent but work was miserable. Management was evil played favorites and harassed me. I loved all my co workers for the most part and I love the friends I made while working there.
bad,"Most stressful job ever for retail yet the best paying job for retail. This job will have you sell, sell, sell with no care to the customer. Upsell is the name of the game, customer service not so much. The problem here is not wanting to help customers its getting them to sign up for a credit card with no benefits, buy more than one item and at regular price, and it better be both or you'll spend 30 mins from 7am to 7:30 on a Saturday morning at ""credit crash"". You are not trained on anything, not even how to use the register when you first start, your training consists of watching videos, that are as outdated as the store itself. You will fight with your co workers and have to chase customers down in order for them to pay with you otherwise the sale and your effort did not count which makes no sense since the money all goes to the same place. Monthly reviews on your numbers, your credit apps and even though you did well you can always do better. Sell more, more, more. Stay away from this place, it is just something else. Customers who buy from 65% off are worthless to Dillard's, and that to me was what was most disheartening about this place. All people and all customers are important. This company is one messed up place."
bad,unprofessional management staff that focused more on producing numbers in reference to competing with other stores in the state.
bad,there is a lot of cut throat in the sales between associates which made it hard to get sales goal at the end of the day.i did not like that when i asked to be moved to another department could not be moved.
bad,"I was employed with this building for 5 years and over those years I've seen it fall into just a dreaded chore of my life. "
bad,"None of the managers communicate with each other to convey important information. Also, they do not care about their employee's well being, and they are terrible at scheduling. When I started, I was told that I would have my schedule at least a few weeks in advance, and schedules actually come out about three days before the new months begins, and it leaves no time for changes that need to be made."
bad,"Management is difficult to work with and unorganized when scheduling. Other sales associates were enjoyable to work with, but going to work was always difficult."
bad,"If you like a good paying jod, Dillards is perfect but no money is worth the overall work place. The manager at Wolfchase is the worse manager I've ever had."
bad,"Overqualified for the position. College degree cleaning a department store. Boring work, felt like a maintenance worker. very low pay and nothing to do most of the time"
bad,"The customers are wonderful. However, the work environment (i.e. management) is unnecessarily stressful. Management is inconsiderate and rude. They are very uncompromising. Additionally, the expectations are unrealistic at times. Overall, if this company replaces its current management teams with people-oriented leaders then it would be a great place to work."
bad,If you like making money and are willing to work hard great place to be.
bad,"Dillard’s was a nice, fun place to work for the first month or so! It overall was a terrible place to work, very dry, all other employees also complained all the time; standing on your feet (which they preferred as ladies wear high hills) for 8+ hours. Very unorganized and always focusing on the least important issues."
bad,"You have to meet a quota every day in sales .   Hardly has business . When it’s your review time, if your not up in sales , you either get s pay cut until you being it up or you get fired. If you get pay cut , you have x amount of time to get it up, if not they let you go."
bad,"They don't care about their employees, and only care about how much merchandise you can push out the door. They drag you on for ridicules amounts of hours if you are full time, and not enough hours if you are part time. They offer HORRIBLE health packages afor full time, and nothing for part time. The managers don't care about you because the Store Manager gets on them for having low numbers in your department. If people aren't going to buy something, it's your fault. They are constantly looking for reasons to fire people as well. In the security room the managers ask that you watch certain people who they "" Suspect "" are stealing things, which they aren't and some even ask that you watch them to see how much they are talking to people. It's a terrible place to work and they only reward you if you exceed the sales that are set to a HUGELY GROSS NUMBER!!! Like I said, money matters more than you. Disgusting."
bad,"Dillards is a decent job as long as you're making your SPH goal, but if you're not then they will cut your pay and terminate you with no sympathy or remorse. However,  I did learn a lot and the pay was excellent being that, it is a retail job. The hours were good, 1 hour lunch breaks, I worked in the lingerie department and we received a lot of Gratis...which was awesome!!! Management was okay, a lot of gossip, drama and snitches so please be careful who you talk to and watch what you say. Don't let ANYONE take your sales!!! But overall as long as you're making your SPH goal you will be fine."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this position were the hours were what I expected, the ability to try and sample products so as to recommend them based on real experience."
bad,"I absolutely love bonding with customers. When i started, i had an open mind, but as time went on my counter manager developed a grudge against me. So she decided to take it further into having other managers dislike me. Finally she went to my Store Manager, and convinced him that i wasn’t good for the job. So needless to say, management has favorites and you WILL be treated unfairly."
bad,"I enjoyed most of the people that work there, but there was always unnecessary drama.  The managers talk about every employee to other employees, and ask their employees to ""spy"" on each other.  Very competitive and unrealistic sales goals."
bad,management only cares about how much money you can bring them and nothing more. Management expects you to hound the customers and make them purchase products.
bad,"I really enjoyed working with our Clients and building a strong relationship with them. There are some wonderful people in Sugarland, TX."
bad,"very  stressful, the employer has to try and make there sell goal every day, every when there' were know customer in the store, every when I was doing my job and making my sale the store manager"
bad,typical day at work- selling ladies shoes.
bad,"Train other associates, Process checks, create daily cashier reports, create displays, assist human resources, vault count, answer multi-line phone system, create cash orders, create deposits, issue supplies, register counts, communicate with auditors, supervise cashiers, process cash, create reports in Microsoft office, and other duties assigned."
bad,"the worst employer I have ever had. I am really surprised the EOC has not come in, or that they have not been sued."
bad,"You have no breaks on Sundays so you work for 6 and a half hours without even a 15 minute break"
bad,The dillard's in daytona seemed to be very racist and as an employee I watched them send security around people just because the color of their skin..
bad,"I only took this job to make money while looking for employment in my field. It was a really cut throat place to work, employees were unprofessional  and nasty."
bad,Poorly managed. No training. Unrealistic goals are set for untrained employees.
bad,This job is good when I first started now it sucks done Been looking for another job I will find one it’s just gonna take time it was a really good job when I first started but I don’t sell clothes so I work in the maintenance department
bad,This company is awful. They make everyone compete with each other instead of allowing everyone to work together. You are expected to reach daily quota's and terminated if you don't succeed rather than relocating you.
bad,"Dillards is slow, sets unrealistic sales quotas, which is crazy because nobody even shops there unless there’s a sale. Not like people can’t afford it walking around with their LV bags talkin bout “I thought this was on sale?!” Ummm lady read the sign it’s Dillard’s, come in here and be prepared to spend money. Management is horrible, they don’t care about their employees at all. Customers are horrible too. This is at the Willowbrook mall location, don’t ever work here Im warning you."
bad,"They let me go after I came back from an off day to tell me that a register was over $600 exactly when I informed them that this had happened when I was off work as they describe it they then pushed the situation back to two days prior when I was working, then tried to get me to sign a phony termination notice without so much as receiving a copy. I’d never so much as even had a write up since working there."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend this job. Coworkers were the  best part of the job! Pay is not reasonable hours are crazy, like I stated I would not recommend this job."
bad,"This is a job that requires a multitude of job requirements such as mega amounts of stamina mentally and physically, and a high stress high pressure environment."
bad,"Dillard's teats employees like trash, in order to save face with customers. I am grateful for the lessons in business management I learned there, but will never go back."
bad,"Contract Loss Prevention. Therefore, unable to give information about the internal workings of Dillard's employment structure. I have been told by employees however, that the sales per hour system of pay is incredibly stressful, and untenable."
bad,"Extremely stressful, awful management that only cares about signing people up for credit cards & has unrealistic expectations for their staff. Basically unobtainable sales goals for most employees, unable to reach raise goal, treated like children by the managers."
bad,"They don't have an HR department (it's 2019, how is this even legal), they don't pay people enough, the PTO policy is garbage, they fire people and then have them sign a document saying they worked out their two-week notice.  DO NOT WORK HERE!! RUN. DO NOT WALK. RUN AWAY FROM THEM!!"
bad,I liked this job to start because they’re positive and uplifting at first. They don’t really care about you and you have no life working here. You never know what’s going on. So much drama.
bad,Communication there was horrible. Management was never on one page they would all tell you different things which made you seem irresponsible when really it was just bad communication
bad,"The bad news: management thrives on shame and fear, control and dominance. "
bad,"When I first started at Dillard's it was almost like they sold you a dream! They management team are nice at first but oh how the tables turn! They do not comply with your schedule needs, you are constantly denied time off request. You will constantly work 6 day weeks. The management team are all in cohoots, therefore no issues are really solved! They will belittle you threaten to spread negative information to other employers about you. Worst of all it all starts from the top and trickles down to the bottom (CEOs to Floor management team)."
bad,this place is poorly ran management is a joke lots of favoritisim. If you value your health stay away from this place the turn over rate is ridiculous every body wants to leave when they find out how poorly ran this business is.
bad,"A typical day would consist of fighting over each others sales to meet a unreachable quota which would result in customers feeling uncomfortable and coworkers turning on one another. The management are almost always rude to their employees expecting way too much without any training. Very slow traffic and boring. The store I worked at always had leaks every time it would rain or snow would melt making it that much more embarrassing to be there. We had no break room and many would eat out in their cars. No recognition for hard work just spitting out unrealistic demands. People would drop like flies and management was barley hiring making it a stressful environment. Couldn't get a discount unless I applied for a Dillard's card. We would have regular thieves come in and security wouldn't be able to do anything without a manager's consent and by that point, they already left the store. Pay was decent  and lots of hours since no one wants to work there. Not worth going through the emotional strain of it all. Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"The expectations were sad, at best. Leadership was confused. Mass exodus in one month. Snarling managers, whining associates, customers were yelled at, disgraceful."
bad,I was overworked and underappreciated. Managment was cruel and uncaring.  One manager in particular clapped her hands at us like dogs.  I was denied a position on the sales floor that I was more than qualified for only because the would rather work me to the bone in dock.  I suppose because they couldn't find anyone else to take the position on short notice - because it was soul-crushing.
bad,"Pay structure set up so that you could actually lose pay if your sales dipped. It was such that expectations were raised during the holiday season as sales increased but then not decreased when sales volume decreased, resulting in pay cuts."
bad,The head managers were unprepared always putting associates down. Didn’t care about any dept but the cosmetics. They don’t do there job well enough. Dept managers were excellent.
bad,Working at Dillard's was a great experience on how to deal with high stress and little to no reward.  We were given unrealistic expectations for sales goals and were reamed when we didn't reach those goals.
bad,Would not recommend; This is a temporary job at best for anyone who just needs a job to bridge the employment gap. The workplace culture is not focused on improving the lives of their people on the bottom-line.
bad,Dillard's management  is unorganized and uncaring for their employees. Their understanding on how to treat people are terrible and they make the work environment a place.
bad,not a great place to work poor managing needs to improve on a lot of things not organized just not a good place to work but it pays the bills for now just looking for a great company to be apart of
bad,Dillards was a mistake on my part. I tried to get into retail and got stuck trying to sell womens' shoes. Why would you put a testosterone filled military veteran in a environment to sell womens shoes? really? I should've stayed in the warehouse instead. I was successful with the company there.
bad,I love working for the company..The staff and the employees where great..I loved the job that I did.  Customer service is my strong point.  I love to work with customers..
bad,Hated this place. horrible management! Having a SPH is horrible because you cant force people to buy anything. The system is out of date and it is hard to keep up with your customers.
bad,"Enjoyed helping my customers, selecting clothes for the customer."
bad,"Great company to work for but the management in this store is very racist, discriminatory and ignorant when it comes to talking to people"
bad,Employees are underpaid and overworked especially during peak seasons. Hours are not guaranteed and management is not the best.  Not a place I would recommend working unless you're in high school
bad,"I love my job, but when you do so much for someone and get no recognition it can really tear you down. The upper management does not seem like they want you to move up they make you feel ""Last on the totem pole"" There are some really great people here don't get me wrong, but I have been working there for three years and nothing has changed only seems to be getting worse. I love being able to create my own looks on the mannequins and to create visuals for customers. I've learned that working in retail everyday is different and some days it can really test your patience!"
bad,Everything about upper management was distasteful.  Average pay with unreasonable expectations.  Bosses sleeping their way into promotions.  Employee harassment that goes unchecked.  Terrible culture.  Should be a last resort job.
bad,This company is all over the place and has no real direction. Pay is pretty good for a retail job but the insurance is HIGH
bad,"I file all associates information, enter time entries, enter information for payroll, audit files. I have learned to count and balance vault and all registers."
bad,"Remodeling figures, Fast work environment , and restocking"
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for! Required to meet daily sales goal that was impossible. Overwhelmed with marking down sales items and unpacking new merchandise.
bad,All animals !!! The management seemed liked that they never went to school. Dont know how to talk to people. The only good thing is that you have an high hourly pay rate
bad,"Tough company to work for, and they expect a lot out of you for the pay. Like most big Retail company's  they only care about the bottom dollar, which is understandable, but if you take better care of their employee's you can run a better company. They use a ""Sale Per Hour Goal"", and they tend to keep a very aggressive employee around, and the hard work who keep the stores standers up lose their job because they take pride in what the store looks like. "
bad,place does not care about the people that work there. they only care about the money they make.
bad,"Dillard's is a horrible place to work, it comes from management.  "
bad,"I learned where every clothing goes like ladies dept, juniors dept etc. I would come in and start doing recovery until it was time for the morning meeting. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The manager gives onl praise to one person even though there's others that put the same amount of effort. The hardest part of the job was standing all day, so break time was a relief. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around cool co-workers."
bad,I did earn very good sales experience from working at Dillards but they lacked good management.
bad,"Typical day would be calling, making appointments, taking photos, and participating in the different goals that were there from month to month. Learing how to pose the children is easy. Every thing about this job is enjoyable except the stress from meeting a certain sells goal."
bad,"i mean, REALLY awful. I would rather be water boarded than work there again. In no way am I joking even a little bit."
bad,This job exposed me to the not so pleasant side of the retail clothing industry as well as the not so good side of corporate America.
bad,"Management is so busy about numbers as opposed to how their employees are treated. Horrible environment, people dont even shop there let alone work there."
bad,makes u practice your customer service skills. they take care of employees.
bad,"While I have gained a wealth of knowledge from being a manager at Dillard's, the company itself is extremely stressful, high pressure, with intense scrutiny from the top down."
bad,"Always be wary of a place that is constantly hiring people. Are they expanding or are people quitting/ getting fired? I came here looking for management experience and a mentor to guide me through my growth as a manager. I have not found a manager that I can speak to on an intellectual level, in regards to managerial skills or overall business knowledge. It saddened me to finally realize, because of the nature of the district manager, the people being promoted to store management are those who can say ""YES SIR!"" the fastest. I wanted an opportunity to be trained, move up, and learn how a major corporation should operate. I did not find it here."
bad,terrible company. Bad company culture from top down. Does not value personal time. Bad management strategies.
bad,"Worked here for 3 years, only to be treated like garbage, and told I don't matter. Also, They never reprimanded my co worker when he was reported for looking at pron on the clock."
bad,Really excited to work here until things got comfortable.. One of the employees actually yelled at me in front of customers!! This same employee hit another employee over a sale! Was a good experience except for dealing with this one employee. The worst part EVERYONE including management knew how terrible she was.. they just didn’t want to do anything to fix it..
bad,"Dillard's is a great company if you are looking for very short-term (2-3 month) work, but due to horrible management Dillard's has become a high stress environment. I have witnessed threats to employees (full-time and part-time) to make sales goals are open credit cards. The management is too young and too detached from the floor to properly manage their employees."
bad,"Really enjoyed working there. Enjoyed working along with the fellow employees, and meeting all of the clients. Upper Management was wonderful, along with most of the ASM's."
bad,"Operation of a front desk with 4 cashiers to train on celebrant system, telephones, gift wrapping, inventory control. Leadership ability is important to train others. Work well with others. The hardest part of this job was the turnover of cashiers. The most enjoyable part working with customers accepting payments for their purchase, making sure they were happy with the merchandise."
bad,*  The company Bruce Hardwood was a great environment to work in with great benefits as well . I wish they were still in business.
bad,"Very unprofessional management. If you’re in a “commission” department, you will never get commission. The pay is pretty good for retail, but not worth working 7 days a week as PART TIME."
bad,"I loved working at Dillard's as a sales associate. I enjoyed meeting customers and pushing myself to meet sales goals. However, management was very hostile."
bad,"I liked the job a lot for many reasons, but also because it did pay well and every week, but the whole store is ran messily, and the people there are mean. My boss harassed me for 8 months and she always made me feel as if I wasn't good enough, eventually she let me go. I work really hard."
bad,"Store didn't announce specials during hours so people wouldn't walk throughout the departments,  then employees would get fired for not meeting their sales goals"
bad,The job mainly consisted of harassment with new management. New manager encouraged harassing and following customers constantly which was uncomfortable.
bad,Quotas and expectations are unreasonable.  A completely numbers driven company that as no regard for employee hard work and dedication.  No compassion for the employee's family well being.
bad,"I made a lot of friends working at Dillard's, but that was because it was a part time job in a college town. Everything about the job, especially the competitive boredom, was pretty bad"
bad,We package items for customers and send them to be shipped out. For the most part the work is easy you’ll be trained on what and how to wrap certain items .
bad,Poor and unprofessional management. There is no room for improvement in this store. Only thing that kept me going was the pay. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone
bad,Management were bullies and didn't care of the of the stress load on the employee at all. Yes they gave me a job but they expected way more and treated you like dirt. Sorry I am not usually negative but this is one of my worst jobs I have ever had.
bad,If you're looking for an easy job this is for you. The management is unorganized and gossip about employees. The over all feeling of the store is uncomfortable
bad,"my experience with Dillards has been successful in sales and customer review "
bad,"They just didn't care much for the ""lesser"" employees not a very good place to work the pay was okay but other than that it was not worth it and that lead to me quitng"
bad,"Dillards store is the worst to shop at. The employees follows you like you are a criminal. Also, I've heard that the y.associates are treated badl They have goals that they have to meet, and if they can't meet them they will get fired."
bad,This is the most negative environment i have ever worked in. Outrageous sales quotas makes associate very aggressive and pressed for numbers. management shows a lot of favoritism and a racist establishment.
bad,"Dillard's really did not care about the associate on the floor, no benefits and honestly lousy pay. Management really did not care. There is a reason they have a high turn over and you see it once you work there."
bad,"I literally walked out of this place, which I have never done in my life. Between the unorganized management, to the unrealistic sales goals  it was like being in ""the place beneath our feet""! I was hired to replace another Cosmetics Business Manager who was promoted to Beauty Director for Dior. I was told that she would be staying on for 2 weeks to train me. This is not what occurred at all. She was there ""managing"" my counter for the entire time I worked there. It caused a lot of confusion and created tension between myself and the part-time Beauty Advisers. There was even an instance where I was reprimanded by the person whose position I was supposed to take over! The roles were not assigned clearly and I was never given the opportunity to do the job I was hired for. It was a shame."
bad,Dillards started out fun and good to there people. Then you find out the truth. You have to make your quota or you will get fired. As a manager you have to do your job plus other managers job because they just don't get it.
bad,"a typical day at work for a manager includes little if any support from management.  The store manager sat in her office most of the day staring at her computer.  Orders and expectations changed throughout the day, making it difficult to keep focused.  Simple associate rules were not followed by associates, and management only punished those who they didn't like."
bad,They are not good to their workers at all.  They treat them like they don't know anything.
bad,Was impossible to meet sells goals. Management was not organized
bad,"This was a retail nightmare, no one ever stayed over 6 months besides me. I had a different manager every month. No growth, no training, no personal goals were set. This job was an in and out sell or dont and very impersonal and no full-filling."
bad,We had start up meetings every morning to go over current business and the expectations from all associates in each department. I learned not to micro manage your associates. I had an assistant store manager do that to me. Never felt the need to ride my associates. I valued them.
bad,"The job has you on a sales per hour system where every hour you work your expected to sell and average over the items in your department.  I was in tailored and as such the average item was 500-1000.  My SPH was 725 per hour. Now this wouldnt be so bad except if you do not make sales goals, they will deduct from your hourly pay.  Can not obtain post 2008 economy."
bad,"I liked this job at first and a big reason why I took this job was because they wanted someone with a family because Dillards is all about juggling work and family..it all stared going south when they never gave me my requested days off...including my childs doctors appointments and other days off even when I gave them to the management a month ahead of time! Also I've never worked somewhere where the management changes the schedule and doesn't call you to let you know so you miss your shift or you come in on a day you were supposed to have off! Then they get mad at you! Also the mold problem is disgusting! The smell hits you in the face as soon as you walk in the place even the customers notice it its embarrassing, also there's a bad bug problem. when it rains the roof leaded all over the clothes and we had to put buckets under the leaking roof..which is also embarrassing when customers say things to you about it! This place says they have extensive one month  training but don't let them fool you they have you train in certain departments the first 2 weeks then they decide what department they want you in or they just throw you in one because they're short staffed in a certain one. All the employees back stab each other talk about one another it  is a very negative place to work you can feel it when you walk in the building. I've seen them fire employees that have worked there for 16+ years because they were $50 short of they're quota!  Theifts are way too long 9:45-9 4 times a week! how is someone with a family going to make that schedule work for them?? I've never worked"
bad,"I worked with Dillard's as A BEAUTY CONSULTANT. The only thing I can compare it to is ""To the Victor go the Spoils."" Its very, very competitive. That is fine.  However,  there is a lot of back stabbing,  lying,  and over-all lack of Senior management.  If you are willing to climb all over everyone,  and be in constant fear Of your job being taken away, then Dillard's is the place for you!  Make sure you are a favorite. Despite being assured there is an""open door""  policy, I can assure you, THERE IS NOT. I would say,  Enter At Your Own Risk."
bad,"The manager is immature, needs to learn how to deal with conflicts with everything thing,."
bad,worked here a few years ago and it was bad then every one gossips even the team leaders
bad,I learned working with people is awsome. On the downside the upper management is terrible and only care about making money for themselves and forget about the people on the front line that are making them the money. The employees which are sales people are awsome. The best part of the job is working with good sales people and the customers and solving the problems.
bad,Managment was distant and non available. Lare turn over in managment.
bad,"a company that expects you to give your 100% but yet wont treat you right, takes advantage of its associates.. very stressful and demanding environment"
bad,"This job I would recommend for a single person. If you have a family this is not the job for you. Dillard's is the type of job who does not consider others before placing them on the schedule. You can tell them that you need a certain day off, but they will still schedule regardless if you request that day off. Bad company..."
bad,"They don't consider which department you work in will affect your sales.  Doing all our jobs well is of no importance.  Only sales figures."
bad,"There’s no flexibility in the work schedule, the management team is unorganized and never on the same page. You work way too much and only get one day off a week. Sales quotas are extremely high and unrealistic for that location. If you have kids you’ll never be home to enjoy them."
bad,"Time is money. You are only the number your sales are. Hard hours, no lunches on 10 or more hour shifts. Manager doesn't work with your schedule. Turn over rate is extremely high. Don't apply here if you want life outside of work"
bad,"The store manager is very abrasive, critical and negative. No praise and not much appreciation. Archaic equipment and technology. Pay is a joke. Benefits are mediocre at best. Filthy carpet."
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"The Dillard’s store manager absolutely plays favorites among her employees and will knock down anyone who isn’t willing to screw over their fellow sales associate. No retail job is ever that good, but Dillard’s truly ruined my perspective of the retail world."
bad,Fast paced environment with high expectations of all associates. Long work hours expected of upper management. Associates that are willing to learn on their own will excel. There is poor training from management due to time commitments and personal beliefs. Individual experiences are different store to store based on the management in place.
bad,Decided to leave because I got pregnant and wanted to stay home to get prepared for my son and go back to school which I finished and graduated before he arrived.
bad,"In the beginning they say they have a great work/Life balance. Its not until you start working there, you realize they dont care. Also the pay is not enough for everything they work you to death over. The managers can be pretty messy. People are always quiting/getting fired. If you work here always have a backup plan."
bad,"I have been there exactly 1-yr. Started off as a Business Manager in cosmetics, realized the work/life balance is UNbalanced. You will LIVE at your job. Went part time and still get scheduled EVERY weekend, even after requesting 1 or 2 off for family obligations. Horrible, incompetent dept manager. Upper managers sweep major issues under the rug and dont want ""dirty laundry aired"" ever. VERY stressful job for too little pay. So NOT worth the peanut pay."
bad,"The only thing that made this job worth working was my amazing coworkers. Management could be A LOT better, but the pay is very decent. My experience there was okay. They don’t have enough security, but like to complain when there is theft. This is a good place to work if you’re only part time, being full time takes away your personal freedom and you basically slave to Dillard’s, not having a social life, EVER!"
bad,"This job seemed to be amazing. The benefits you get are great. And the 25% off discount sounded nice (before they tell you that you need to apply for a dillards card.) The management seemed super awesome and friendly (It was probably because of the holidays a time to make the most money.) But over time things fell apart very quickly. First your assigned locations manager will NOT be able to help or listen to you very easily. So if you have problems with coworkers that are pretty serious and a danger to others don't expect to be listened to. Second if you don't meet your number every month or at least exceed them you will NOT get the you were told to begin with but instead get a pay cut. So even on slow days when no one is shopping you will suffer. And the blood spill between coworkers is depressing. There is NO team work just ME work. Third, IT. IS. A. CORPORATION. Yes it can pay you a bit more and it can provide insurance coverage but since it is a corporate place it will burn you out quickly. With the burnout will come very little pay or care for you the employee. They also overwork those who are commissioned because it is different from hourly pay. Legally they can do that but it will burn you out and can potentially cause depression and suicidal thoughts. Burn out is classified as a serious problem in the states and needs to be taken more seriously. "
bad,"This company is horrible. Terrible customer service & dreadful management. About a year ago when I found out that I had the opportunity to work at Dillard’s I was ecstatic because I held them at such of a high standard company. "
bad,"wow what can i say request time off months ahead of time schedules come out and they schedule you for it. Have class during certain hours, dont worry they will schedule during that time. Programs are outdated using system from early 90s, Management was the worst area managers were constantly told they were wrong and there is no clear voice of leadership. If you took initiative youd be shot down. Customer service was very high but it is null because store was so poorly executed people walked in and lauughed. honestly dont work there unless you are okay with being used."
bad,"You constantly worry if you're going to be fired/get a pay cut at your next review. You were given unrealistic goals. The majority of people were fair, but a handful of sales persons made it awful for everyone else. You could go above and beyond with customers, keep your area clean and organized, and it won't matter if you aren't selling enough. They want you to do everything and anything, but sell sell sell while doing it. Extremely hostile work environment on some days, constantly in certain departments, and management liked it that way because they could show off their shining stars. One person in the department would sell over 3 times as much as everyone else for the day and would still stay past their scheduled time off to continue to sell. Saw certain people going in and out of managers offices because of issues on the sales floor with other sales workers, but nothing was ever done other than a slap on the wrist. Fights would ensue in front of customers over their sale and complaints would be made. But nothing ever came of it."
bad,"Nice at first and then management progressively become uterly insane and cause drama, try to intimidate employees below them. Hostile work environment! Unfortunately, thru out history 6 mo is the average employment of a beauty consultant at Dillard's."
bad,"Through out the years, the company has changed for the worst. They treat their staff, from management to associates like dirt. The managers work on a salary income and usually work 40 to 80+ hours a week. While the associates work on hourly with little time off. Because of the healthcare issues in our country, most of the hourly workers work part-time so that the company does not have to pay for benefits. The daily sales goals and other required goals are unrealistic to achieve. If after a set amount of time you have not reached these goals, you will  be terminated."
bad,No tips but be careful and sale. You have a quota that you must need everyday and get atleast 2creditsna week ........................................
bad,"Assistant manager can't seem to get the schedule right; when hired you're asked for your hours of availability and thats overlooked somehow when the schedule is released."
bad,"Dillard's imposes a quota for each employee in which it is unreasonable to attain.  A high stress type of job due to high quotas by the company. On a positive note, work hours are flexible and there are employee discounts."
bad,"I studied for four years, working hard to get my degree so I wouldn't have to kill myself working to make a living. Dillard's verges on the abusive with its employees. It's too much work and then gives them impossible quotas they have to meet. Everyday my legs and feet are throbbing in pain. I sleep for hours and I still wake up to the pain. I've woken from sleep because the pain was so bad. And then the terrible pay? No way!"
bad,No opportunities to advance within the company. I learned how to pick up management skills while our department was lacking a manager. Learned how to think on my feet and work quickly and efficiently. They always hire from outside and do not offer advancement for current employees.
bad,Work included sales and cashier due to retail business. Enjoyed customer interaction.  Hardest part of job is constant standing. Discount is good. Advantage is knowing sales promotions.
bad,"Dillards co-workers were very cooperative to work with; however, the office staff and upper management were so cut-throat and unappreciative of the hard work that all the make-up counter personnel put in."
bad,My time with Dillard's has been unhappy there have been two job promotions that I was overqualified for but was never given an interview  or explanation as to why I was not considered.  Many of my coworkers only keep their jobs because of their paychecks.  I am looking for more than a paycheck.
bad,Dillard's was a very easy job when it came to the duties that needed to be upheld. But the morale of the store was very low. Not many were happy and it was pain to get up and go to work each day. I feel as if the managers could use a little more training when it comes to positive reinforcement and things of that sort.
bad,"As a sales associate at Dillards, you must sell sell sell. There is no excuse or way around it. If you do not meet your sales they will let you go. Management and company is headed in the wrong direction."
bad,"I was a manager at Dillard's for 2 years. We had a smooth running, family type environment, until we got a new assistant store manager. Absolutely awful, he treats the people who run his store like garbage. They will lose all their good employees because of the way he talks down to his associates and managers."
bad,This environment is terrible. Harassment is common and issues are never addressed. Store managers have favorites and treat others unfairly. If you work here don't expect to have a life outside of dillards.
bad,"I worked at store #418 for over a year, the management staff is horrible and very unprofessional. They give special privileges to certain employee's and make up jobs to employ friends. You get promoted based on if the store mangers likes you, not based off work experience. On Sunday's you work 7 hours with no break, and smoke breaks/15 min breaks are only given to mangers and certain employee's. The mangers even know of employee theft but do nothing about it unless it's an employee that they do not like. Overall the company is great to work for but I wouldn't recommened anyone to work for store #418until a new mangament team is hired."
bad,"Pay rate was evaluated by amount of sales percentage. If business was slow, your pay rate was decreased. Hard to get time off when needed due to coverage, Sales were never reliable,"
bad,"Extremely stressful environment, every individual I have spoken to that works or has worked at Dillard's hates it. The store manager is horrible, she does not care about the employees what so ever. She has a very ugly stuck up attitude. If you have a busy life outside of work I definitely do not recommend working at Dillard's in Midland TX. They called me within 30min of me submitting an application, hired within days. That's when I should have realized how desperate they were on hiring staff.The pay is great. The management sucks, and they are definitely not flexible."
bad,The company seems to be dying... Walk into the place and it's literally desolate. Not a customer in sight. It's hard to meet your quota when there isn't anyone to buy!
bad,Working for dI'll arden wany great the first 4 years.I was left in the back of the store for years was promised promotion time and time again never happened until 4 years later.got a raise and new position.
bad,Good for a temp job but nothing you can work your way up into even if you are in college. They expect the impossible and if they arnt satisfied they can make you go from full time to part time if they want.
bad,"I was placed in the fragrance section and had outrageous sales goals. They did not understand that it is impossible even doing everything they say ""works"". I also was hired with an agreement with the assistant store manager that I could have days off for a already planned vacation, and they didn't give me them off. I was forced to calling in everyday because they are unorganized. I hated my experience with this company and would never go back."
bad,"I do not like working for Dillard. Very unfair atmosphere, if management doesn't like you then you have no chance of moving up in company whether you deserve it most or not. They do not treat employees very well, and make it very hard to enjoy working in retail."
bad,"Management definitely need to focus on working together to help the store and quit focusing on what gossip they can spread. Also, they need to focus on employees who do there job and promote to full time associates, no one can live on part-time work."
bad,"If you excel at sales, you are semi-safe. Be aware of changing standards, as they are never fixed. Also, stop expecting your work life to make sense, as this company has no rhyme or reason to their whims."
bad,"I loved this company when I first started off. They got me with the ""If you make your numbers you get a raise and you can advance"" Bs, and then a few months in, it hits you. Dillards is not a well known company. They don't advertise like Macy's does and they're not known enough like nordstroms or saks to not be advertising. Traffic there is so bad. Associates would go hours without seeing a customer. Long story short, because of the slow traffic, that will affect your sales you will be getting a paycut. I dont know anyone who has ever worked there for more than a year that hasnt gotten one. And if youre one of the unlucky one you will probably get fired."
bad,"I liked that we got paid weekly which helped out with having money every week. Met some amazing people. Didn't like the the feel that I had to be pushy to customers to purchase in order to get a raise. If you did not sale your quota, you would get a decrease in pay which sucked! Only a few people are left in there that I use to work with, the rest were fired or quit, which calls for the high turnover rate."
bad,"only seen manager one time in the 4 months I was employed there, had to compete with two other ladies to keep up my sales per hour, if you fall below your sales per hour after 3 months you would loose a dollar of your hourly pay and they raise your sales per hour every 3 months, I did learn how to merchandise apparel."
bad,They have unreal expectation. The quota system is depressing. Overall avoid working there because before you know it depression will take over your life.
bad,i was told that the temp would place me perm. give me 40 hours a week i barely recvd 20 the supervisor actually lied about several employees.
bad,It is a very unstable environment. Management is horrible.
bad,Cosiderably understaffed. Hardest part of my job was to make a high hourly quota and to get people to sign up with the store credit card
bad,"Strong and hard working staff"
bad,"I learned that I am very good at merchaindizing.I got even better at customer service.Mgmt was very unorganized,and unreliable. The hardest part of my job was to learn how to be a good sales person. The most enjoyable was that I got to design displays,jewlery cases, and walls."
bad,"This has to be one of the worst jobs I have ever had. The management could care less about you as a human being, but only care of you can sell. The pay is the only thing that keep most people because it's higher than minimum wage. They do not believe in a work like balance at all, and if your not willing to give your life over then I suggest you look elsewhere. The employee turn around here is ridiculous and purely reflects the experience. They change employees just like underwear."
bad,"Management rarely available, not very helpful, uninformative. If busy not a bad place to work, wages just arent enough for a person to independently support themselves."
bad,"Dillards was a challenging job because of the quotas and the fact that they hired too many ppl for one department, they dont adjust the quota for ex. we were required to make the same amount during the spring as christmas time and people dont shop as much so it always felt like we were fighting for sales. They also allow certain employees to get away with alot."
bad,"Management at Dillard's was atrocious. Most of the upper-level managers would not even acknowledge the sales associates and would never ask their opinion about company matters or changes in policy. A lot of promises were made about promotions and simple forms of advancement but were never followed through with. Management tried to lure you in with incentives, but then would never live up to their promises and would avoid all types of confrontation. Not a healthy environment to be apart of."
bad,No way to advance in the corporate office. Non-competitive pay. No job security. No work life balance. It is common for jobs to be consolidated and as much work as possible to be put off on one person without a raise. Without competitive pay to begin with.
bad,"Upper management is out of touch with economic times, Instead of following Mr Dillards visions they pretty much make it up as they go along and have unrealalistic view of really how hard the good ones work and let the poor ones promote"
bad,Dillards did not seem to bad upon needing a job quickly. I thought it couldn’t be “that bad”. Please read reviews. Sales sales sales is the only goal- which is common in a workplace. Howevencourage you
bad,"Wasn't given the proper training, was simply given a small tour of the floor, crowded behind a counter to log into a computer to learn how to clock in/out, and then thrown in our respective departments. The daily quotas and numbers that were required to be met every day became unbearable. You can't force people to spend money!"
bad,"When I worked for Dillard's they weren't sales associate friendly. They allowed people from other depts. to steal your sales. My manager kept me preoccupied with unloading freight, placing the items on their shelves. I did bed/dish displays and I was often kept in a small room ironing the bed skirts for the bed displays. Plus we had to mark down prices frequently. I wasn't serving customers as often as I needed to be. The management was nice, but not very helpful. It seems to be that Dillard's pitted their employees against each other. I really felt out of place at their company. I wasn't able to maintain their sales goals as they wanted, so I was let go. I never was late even once and I always did what my manager asked. Dillard's ask their employees to reach sales goals that were unreachable. I did my best, but that wasn't good enough. I was in the slowest dept. Home goods."
bad,"Your job is always at risk."
bad,"They will take pay away or just fire you over not making sales goals over three months, even if the whole store is the same. Very high turn over. VERY Rude management."
bad,"When I started at Dillard’s I had high expectations but was let down quickly. "
bad,Originally applied for mens department but got put into ladies shoes after speech on how I can earn more with commissions. Department manager was no help and was only looking after self. Pay is good but what they don't tell you is your hourly pay is reduced if you don't hit your monthly sales quota and is based on a Sales Per Hour Draw. Commission is a joke though and is almost nothing especially during sales where you earn less than half on each sale shoe sold versus regular price. If you want a job in shoe sales stick to non-commissioned based jobs and away from Dillards.
bad,A lot of physical labor putting up clothing and a lot of pressure to meet your daily quota.  If you don’t meet your quota you do not get a raise at the yearly review date. If it is slow due to the economy you could lose your job or get a decrease in pay.
bad,"Clock in and go straight to your area, would try to sell as much as you could before the 6 o'clock mark hits. "
bad,Dillard's has no job work-life balance and they hardly respect or appreciate their employees. Also. the promenade mall is dying so there is basically no foot traffic anymore
bad,"Catty work environment, very competitive. Lots of people only looking out of themselves, there is no team work initiative, its every man for himself. Had problems getting a handle on staff even though I was in charge. No authority."
bad,"If you enjoy competing with your coworker's and having most of the people around you use dirty tactics to try and out sell you instead of working as a team then this might be right up your alley. In my experience all management cares about is those sales numbers at the end of the day, not how you got them, and not any other efforts and work you put in aside from just closing the sale. Scheduling is a mess, it's different every week, and though they lure you in with all the possibilities, unless you are willing to throw your conscience aside to meet their numbers and then some, working here will quickly suffocate you and all your aspirations.  **disclaimer: I'm not sure if management has made any changes, this was my overall experience working there for a year. I did meet some good people there but I felt the environment fostered tension even amongst friends. I never went into a deficit which is falling below the quota that basically pays your hourly wage but I never received a bonus either. I did tons of behind the scenes work, along with working the sales floor and was not acknowledged for any of it until I handed in my resignation. Every opportunity for promotion that opened up while I was there was given to those with the highest sales numbers everytime, regardless of their actual leadership abilities or ability to ""manage"" the floor in their area"
bad,"Some weeks you get 20 hours, some weeks 40 hours and no joke literally 3 hours. The store manager is a racist lady. The sales goals and quotas turn employees against each other. And against customers. No ones job is secured here. They fire & Hire depending on how busy they expect to be. Or they will drop your pay."
bad,"The store's goal was to sell as much as they could no matter the cost. They couldn't have cared less about the employees; if you gave them an inch, they would take a mile."
bad,"""Flexible schedule"" they changed it with little to no heads up on it, they would alter it almost daily. The quotas were very unrealistic and completely unfair. My goal would be $1000 on a day where there weren't many customers and I would be working for 3 hours."
bad,"you have to multitask and make sales, also maintaining everything clean and organized. still watching out for other sales associates not to steal sales. seniority is valued at company instead of hardworking employees. management is only interested in sales. the perks is that you have a good discount on merchandise. depending in department you get many hours. i would not recommend the shoe department."
bad,"Dillard's owns you.  They pay well, but plan on working with terrible store managers and having a lot of stress.  You must be able to sell or you will not make it there."
bad,"The store in Atlantic Station had a great General manager..He got a promotion to the mall of Georgia..And we got stuck with this new guy..He did every thing wrong!! Smiles in your face, and started firing almost everybody in the store..It's a beautiful store..But when a mean selfish person is given power..you know the rest..I could just go on and on, about his CHARACTER..It's not good when people don't care about other people!!"
bad,"All the store managers care about are credit cards, credit cards, and more credit cards they give you an extremely high SPH (sales per hour goal) when they hire during the holiday season just to cut your pay afterwards and eventually let you go, hard work is NOT rewarded here only sales and credit cards is all they care about and it doesn’t matter how you sale or get a credit card as long as you get it done. Co-workers were cool but some are extremely lazy and get away with not doing anything  as long as they sale. The store security is a joke half the time they’re not even there and your left to deal with thieves trying to steal all the time as well as trying to sales it’s ridiculous..."
bad,"In my department of ""Home"" it was extremely slow until there was a sale.  Very hard to meet your expected numbers.  Management was always changing.  I enjoyed setting up the floor though and learning how to display new merchandise such as China and decorating the beds.  Christmas time was exciting.  After Christmas was not."
bad,Mangement is horrible they do not care about the employees or what they have to do. The benefits are probably the worst thing ever it is almost better to find your own somewhere else. The job is easy but when you have to put up with a management staff like that one it makes the job horrible and it makes it so you don't even want to show up anymore. If you are looking to get a job here I recommend you just stay with it part time once you go full time they could care less about family issues or anything else life throws at you. They also give you virtually impossible sales goals so you can never get a raise.
bad,"There is no work/life balance when you work at Dillard's. It is an okay job temporarily, but not for the long run. Management is poorly trained, and expect you to hit goals with minimal training."
bad,"I've been with the company for several years. Managers do not respect a desire for off days. Constant and challenging hours. Hours vary from day to day and having any type of personal life isn't an option. Employees have individual sales goals and therefore, do not work as a team. Having been with the company and constantly exceeded the expectations, I rarely received even a ""good job"" much less any type of advancement. You have to sell sell sell or your pay will get cut."
bad,"The Sales per hour environment makes it very difficult to totally service the customer. If a sales associate has a client that needs a lot of time and attention, Chances are one of your co-workers will be helping several customers while you are tied to your one customer. At the end of your review period, if you have not made your SPH for the period, your will receive a pay cut. You are given a time frame to be able to gain it back, but the whole SPH component makes for a very nasty work environment."
bad,"I worked here for over 2 years! In the beginning it was  a great job. Then, they hired a girl from my department to be our department manager. She did not know what she was doing and was very manipulative. I worked in the Jr's section and the hours she would give us make it very hard to reach our sales goals."
bad,"Encourage customers to enroll in Dillard’s rewards program."
bad,"The typical day is mostly stocking shelves and hanging clothes greeting customers. It is usually quiet and the hardest part is working on commission."
bad,"Dillards is a great place to learn management because of the chaotic situations that arise on a daily basis. If you can hang in there, you will learn how to keep your cool and delegate effectively in a very high stressed and unorganized arena. Prepare to be on your own however as the management staff is not primarily trained to deal with different personalities or work together as a unit with other managers/departments. After about a year or maybe a year and a half you will be ready to move forward with your new set of skills."
bad,"If you like micromanagement, terrible employee communications, pay cuts, getting written up for things you can't control, and stress, work @ Dillards."
bad,"Crazy schedules, unfair practices, the pay is great. Advancement opportunities are minimal. The individuals that get promoted do not get promoted on rank, experience, education, or any measureable reason. Schedules are changed frequently, and make no sense."
bad,"This was another learning experience.  Dillard's expected an extremely high dollar amount of sales production, for a wage that was not livable for me."
bad,"Working there was great as far as being a Sales Associate and meeting and greeting customers. The management however, are non emotional and could care less about your life outside of Dillard's. They start you out at a great hourly wage, but expect you to spend most of your days there and you only get one weekend off a month."
bad,Dillard's had demanding sales quotas that were not always attainable and poor schedules that fluctuate weekly. Due to having daily sales goal quotas this was not the ideal place for positive relations with coworkers because there was competition for sales.
bad,The quotas that have to be met are very hard.  The managers are not compassionate and employees have to apologize to customers all the time for their behaviors. Employees hourly rate can change every 3 to 6 months.  As a part time employee we have to work every weekend and holiday.
bad,"A typical day at work included running the cash register, processing transactions, and placing shipment on the sales floor. I learned merchandise flow as per standard operating procedure. Management had a high turnover rate due to employee dissatisfaction so I was unable to get to know any of the leaders well. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers."
bad,Long hours and no appreciation. No sense of balance from upper management. Its a ride you into the ground and discard you company. Managers follow the labor laws that fit the need of the Store Manager.
bad,as a beauty adviser your ability to up-sale is critical with this employer. this job is all about numbers and never about you as an actual person. i loved what i did if it wasn't all about selling.
bad,"In my experience, I worked 6 months seasonally during Christmastime 2012. It was fun the first couple of weeks, because I got to play with fragrances, and learn new things about ones I have already known about. It was also fun being able to help customers christmas shop, and really help with their stress. I really really loved the job, and would it do it somewhere else that paid more and I didn't have to work weekends (which is nearly impossible!) The one thing that was very bad to work with, was the high school gossip. Even the managers participated in it, and it made it very hard to concentrate on the customer because it would sometimes be right in front of me, or before the customer came. The managers were very nice, and did their job, but they also liked to partake in gossiping about their own employees to other employees or managers in other departments. Dillard's as a whole is very overestimated. Their corporate office is very hard to deal with, and they often don't respond. The experience here made me love fragrances even more, but really faced me to the music of corporate retail!"
bad,My supervisor liked to gossip and encouraged other employees to do so as well.  She was very unprofessional.  There was always conflict in our department which made it a difficult place to work.
bad,"management doesn't care about their employees, it's all about sales"
bad,Fast pace comapny I love the hours alongf with the customers.
bad,Poor workplace to thrive in with no proper training and bad management...I would not recommend this place to work for anyone
bad,Working with customers was the best part of the job. Management and supervisors delegated training to peers not motivated to share information.
bad,"work from 9am to 9pm with 30minute lunch only break"
bad,"Overall, I liked my department manager and my employees that I worked with, but as far as management. They have their favorites and if you're not one of them then beware,"
bad,Management was hard to talk to. There was no room to grow and hardly promoted within. There was no work/life balance. Large turn over and hours were hard to work around.
bad,"Enjoyed their products, and selling/wearing them, but hated the company.They don't have commission, but pay raises are based on a sales per hour.  Not attaining a sales per hour equals a deduction in pay based on the percentage you were short.  My store manager was a suck up and a push over.  Only ever walked the store when corporate came.  My direct supervisor was a total jerk and rude. Made up stories about employees to get them fired and was rude to female employees.  After several complaints, rather than fire him etc, they just promoted him to assistant store manager at a different store."
bad,"A typical day included staffing, recruiting, driving sales, coaching associates, merchandising, markdowns, stock, floor and stockroom maintenance, and planning for future events."
bad,"The schedules were always changed or altered without the employees knowledge so they would be held responsible for any conflicts with the scheduling. The management was poor, some played favoritism. The sales goals were sometimes unrealistic for some departments because they were overstaffed and it made it hard for everyone to reach a high sales goal. The raises were based off your sales so you could either get a raise or have your current hourly rate lowered."
bad,"A normal day at Dillard's is always talking to customers and greeting them. Everyone is friendly and easily able to get along with, I learned that there's a lot of name brands I didn't know they had. Management is good but kind of hard to get a hold of when you need them. Co-workers are very nice and hardworking when you need something they are able to help. The hardest part was trying to make your quota every month on sales you only worked off commission. I enjoyed dressing up everyday and seeing what was new."
bad,Dillards was a very fun job but also very stressful because i had a quota everyday and also credit cards we needed to have a day so that made it very hard to do but i very much do miss the customers i had and also the employees.
bad,i spent 12 years for this company i was very loyal employee.this company was rated a the worst company to work for in the usa.
bad,"Customer Service , sales enviroment, developted new management technics, very usefull for the cosmetic field. High sales volume with very much daily stress. Not worthed. Ok perks."
bad,what can i say other then it wasnt for me too slow i think you stand more then you spend time selling merchandize to customers even during the holliday the manager was rude and non compashionate with family emergincy
bad,Overall I did not like the environment nor the rigorous high quotas. I definitely felt I was underpaid for all the things that were required of me. I had no time for an outside life meaning family and School.
bad,Management lie to employees to make them compete against each other.
bad,"Walk around and promote new frgrances handing out samples, food and getting creative with visual display. Interacting with employees and customers"
bad,"Ridiculous rules. Took box cutters that were safe, told us to use an open pair of scissors to open new stock. I carried my own, safe, box cutter."
bad,"Dillard's is a good place to work for a job, not a long term career. Pay does not change very much over the course of 20 years."
bad,"- A normal day involves: puting up frate, cleaning your area, helping costumers, trying to make your sales quota, trying to convence people to open a credit application."
bad,"The pay beats many like employers and that is how they will get great people applying. But the work culture is chaotic and unhealthy. I took the position thinking I would be there for a few months but like I said the pay is great (for the area) so I stayed over a year, looking back it was not worth staying so long. Everyone's job is always on the line, management creates drama among employees, owners visit OFTEN but RARLEY give employees the time of day- not even a hello. In store management has a real problem with communication. One manager will tell you to make everything blue and while working another will come by, get onto you for doing it wrong saying it should be green, then trash the other manager for picking blue. I am a great hard working employee and just could not be around this environment. I kept my head down and worked hard so I didn't have as much negative attention towards me BUT I could not look away from the way management speaks to each other or my co-workers. Surprisingly, for the pay and starting a career in retail or just needing something to help transition I would say yes take this job but always work on your plan out. Do not get comfortable. Not a disgruntled employee just someone with management experience who knows they should do better by their employees."
bad,"My immediate manager was great, and I got the sense that most of the other department managers were as well. Unfortunately, upper management and corporate were not supportive of their employees and showed little interest in retaining them. Employees are not explicitly encouraged to compete for customers, but with the quota system they have set up, that's how it worked out. You have a dollar amount of sales you're assigned and you have to make that amount consistently or you don't keep your job. This would be fine, except that the numbers are unrealistic. This causes unnecessarily direct competition between employees and causes an unhealthy, if not toxic, environment."
bad,"Whether you are in the buying office or the stores everyone hates their job. Management discriminates against both race and being gay. They bully people into leaving if they don’t like you. Zero chance of a cost of living raise, raises only if you meet and exceed ALL of your numbers. Management won’t put money into training their employees or fixing the stores. Everything is stuck 30 years in the past. Starting salary is decent, but don’t expect to make any more than that."
bad,"Working here starts okay, your new, fresh got a smile on your face. They promise to teach you. Then dump you on the seasoned employees one week later to have them teach you. They swear to have an inclusive schedule but constantly make mistakes and work you on days where you are unavailable. They never get the schedule out sooner than two days before month end and if you work full time, good luck ever having a sane work schedule. Most of the managers have a favorite, which is normal in most places. Promises of ability to move up but no actual training or effort to help you do so unless you are said favorite. Sales goals are mostly unattainable, unless you step on other people to reach them especially during slow months, but they expect you to reach them or risk being fired. Insurance is preached, eye and dental are okay, health insurance is expensive and isn't any good. Overall, great place to get a foot into sales and get some experience but not to stay long term."
bad,It’s a typical 9/5 job. If you’re looking for a full time job with good pay this is the one. It’s very tiring through the hours seem to move slower than slow.
bad,"I was hired as part time. They made me full time without my permission and as a student, I am not able to work these hours. After talking to my manager, nothing changed."
bad,When I was first brought onto the team the manager personally posed it as a challenge that the job has a high turn overrate. He explained it as people lacking team spirit. I assumed I would fit in naturally as my last position was entirely team based. I was wrong. At Dillard's your coworkers are fighting for the same hours and raises as you. They won't help you if it cuts into their time. Management was never present as absent 90% of the time giving little to no direction on how to do your job effectively.
bad,"In my experience, the Dillard's environment is very ""thrown to the wolves"". You may be given a week of ""training"", if you call being sat in a room to watch pointless videos over and over again as training. Then you're thrown to the sales floor and expected to meet your S.P.H. (sales per hour) by all means necessary. Most associates that I know in the store currently, do not meat their S.P.H. due to the fact that no one goes into Dillard's, and if they do, they might only buy one or two things due to the pricing. You're hours, pay, and benefits get cut if you do not meet your S.P.H. There are no programs or infrastructure in place to help those who fall behind on S.P.H., and management only cares about numbers. If their number reports do not show growth or numbers that are in the green, then the whole world will come crashing down around you. As an employee who works in the salon area of the store, I do not have the looming threat of S.P.H. hanging over me, but it breaks my heart when I see sales floor associates frantically running around trying to persuade clients and guests to make a purchase just so that they could have a sale for the day. For me personally, I've tried to talk to my manager about getting more hours and or a raise, or even becoming full-time, I was told that I wasn't worth a raise and that she wouldn't raise my hours. Currently, I do not break over $300 a week, and I find myself actively seeking another job, because this is not a living wage or a friendly company to work for."
bad,They’ll offer you full time as a part time worker during the holiday season just to make you work harder. Don’t fall for the hype. The job has a high turnover.
bad,The only reason I liked my job is because I respected and loved my own manager. The rest were terrible. Always talking down to employees and talking about them. They purposely did things out of spite and made up blatant lies. I was surprised that they were considered managers because they acted like high-schoolers. It mostly stems from the district managers. The workplace is toxic no matter where you go and if it’s not consider yourself lucky.
bad,"Dillard's was a great place to grow as an employee and manager, but the hours were horrendous and you hardly get a thank you for a job well done. The pay is great, but when there is no compensation for working 20 hours of overtime when on salary, the pay is not so great anymore."
bad,"Management tended to micromanage developer time, and didn't allow much freedom for their employees. Too hung up on time spent on desk instead of emphasizing code quality or meeting deadlines. "
bad,"Dillard's was good for about the first 2 weeks, then things began to show themselves. Management overall is RUDE and are not concerned with the employees and what they need to succeed in their positions. They can't formulate a basic greeting or respect for their employees. Management likes to sit in the office and gossip and waste time. They will overwork you and when you speak up it is a problem. They do not confront issues head on unless it has to do with sales. Their conflict resolution skills are SERIOUSLY FLAWED. Hearing management wonder as to why they can't keep employees is hilarious, because they do not see how their actions contribute to employees leaving. They turn it on the employee saying they weren't built for this or that they explained what they were coming into. They will tell you that it will be a struggle and building clients needs consistency which is true, but they don't tell you how the culture is not nurturing and a growth-mindset environment."
bad,"Treatment for managers was awful ,managers dont care about anything else,store manager (conrad cornwell ) is the worst ,he thinks making employee feel less grows him more ,they only care about employees who kiss their buttons 24/7 ."
bad,"Management was very unprofessional. Managers walked around and talked to each other and gossiped more than they actually did their job. They treat you poorly if you don't bow down to them, they say the are family oriented but that's 100% false, I got fired due to having to miss work because my daughter got sick. After they brought to my attention that I was being terminated I was super understanding and they said they'd give me 2 weeks to find another job before they let me go and within those 2 weeks I was treated very poorly the main manager would roll her eyes anytime she seen me, she made me feel very uncomfortable and the managers went and told everyone what had happened, after I was told it would be confidential and whatever was said in the room stayed there. I didn't mind it, but the fact of the matter was they acted like little school girls and I thought it was super childish. The work is easy but it's super boring most times. It's very slow paced for the most part. The only good thing that came from that job was the pay. Typically you get paid anywhere from $8.50-$10.00 an hour for retail but DIllard's paid $13 an hour and the hours were pretty decent. However, if you go over 40 hours they won't pay you or they'll make you take extra long breaks. Personally, I think they treat workers poorly when they don't get their way and use the pay as a way to make workers do what the want so they basically threaten losing your job."
bad,"I worked here for 2 months and that was enough. If you don’t make your sales goal in 3 months they fire you. 9 hour shifts on your feet (for full-time) I would be sore every day. Weekend hours, non-set schedules (comes with retail). Unrealistic sales goal, that store would be extremely dead yet you were expected to sell $1000 worth a day. Decent management but it’s all an act. My associate was an amazing clerk, always cleaned/ organized the store, very good with  customers, worked there 3 months and was fired on the spot because she was slightly under the sales goal."
bad,"falta organizacion y hay un mal trato para l empleado prueba esta que todo el que entra no dura, algunos se quedan porque no les queda de otra!! tratan muy mal al personal."
bad,"None of the management knows how to actually talk to the employees. I can ask my manager a pretty important question that I need a quick answer to and he’ll respond days later. Yes, the pay is good but the way you get talked down to by the managers is not worth it. I have even taken my problems to the store manager and he basically told me to “try to talk it out with my manager” like I hadn’t tried before and I still continue to have problems."
bad,The managers are very unprofessional. They don’t want to hear about what you have going on at home just make sure you show up on time. We can work up to 8 days without an off day and basically have no life outside of work. You either get off anywhere between 6-9:30. They make you do several things at once while still trying to make your quota which is very unreasonable. We’re very slow Monday and Tuesdays so my goals shouldn’t be in the 2000s and for what they’re paying you it’s not worth it. They talk bad about employees.
bad,The morale is horrible.  Management is always pitting employees against each other.  They are so stuck on Sales Per Hour (SPH) that associates literally fight each other.  The customer suffers because of this and the workplace is miserable to be at.
bad,"Leadership is typical corporate retail. Conversations about performance happen amongst supervisors and not with the employee. The employee is given no heads up of performance, or guidance then is randomly pulled in and told they have been doing a poor job and must improve."
bad,Sells per hour goals for many sales associates were not realistic. No store carried the same volume which made  larger stores more successful. You have no life if you are a sales manager. We were often told as sales managers that we had the toughest job at Dillards... our pay did not reflect that.
bad,"Dillards sales associate policy need be changed. They call SPH. per sales in hours. if you do not meet required sales amount first 6 month will cut off pay or fired. If you meet your SPH, guess what? you have to sales more!!!"
bad,This is a very competitive sales floor. A lot of Associate taking other Associate sales. Not enough Associate on the floor. Under paid for the work. Favoritism and very toxic
bad,"I was so unhappy at Dillard’s. The management is terrible. There are no career opportunities, no career advancements, they don’t care about family. (Not family-oriented)"
bad,if it weren't for the harassment that was never resolved I would have stayed. I loved my area and meeting clients. it was a very competitive job due to having set quotas we needed to maintain but if you worked together with your fellow area associates it could have been met more easily and the area work would have been divided equally. I feel that during slow hours and days exceptions should've been made for not meeting your daily goal. an employee cant help it if the entire store didn't even make it's daily goal. also they really didn't value hard working employees only their numbers. the turn over rate is very high because of that .
bad,Have to sell a credit app every month to avoid mandatory meetings on Sunday mornings. No benefits and crazy hours. Able to get commissions and work on unique projects in-store.
bad,"You can be demoted without cause. Management will tell you one thing then tell you something else the next week. Employees are not treated fairly. Those who cannot do, get help. Those who can do get criticized."
bad,"Management was terrible. Had consistent trouble with scheduling,and other employees not pulling their weight and expecting everyone else to do their work for them while they stayed behind the counter to get sales while other employees had to do all the stocking and could not get a chance to get their sales numbers, but management did not care."
bad,"The management is TERRIBLE at Willowbrook Mall location. Thefts were always occurring, at least several times a week. The restrooms need a good mopping to say the least. The out of touch sales and credit app goals they give are laughable."
bad,"Selling standards can be brutal.  Credit applications are almost impossible in some departments but you are encourage to get one anyway.  "
bad,"They had a daily meeting before opening and quotas reign. The workers were really nice people but were worked like slaves."
bad,"During a typical day, an associate is expected to put out all new merchandise, dress mannequins, continuously clean, do markdowns, manage fitting rooms, manage clientele and take care of all customers who are in the store. You must constantly maintain your sales goals. If you do not make your goals each review, you receive a pay cut. If you fall below the hiring wage, you are automatically terminated. If you fall below 67% of the department average, you are automatically terminated. The only thing you are reviewed on is your sales. "
bad,"Very strict with attendance. Don't care if your produce sales for them, they are all about the money. Looking for a new job because of this. They have no loyalty to their managers."
bad,You have to sell to say alive meaning selling 1400. A day and if don’t they get rid of you so many good people are gone what more can l say if don’t make your goal each day they fire you
bad,"Work was alright. I was a cashier and I sorted out clothes. Talking to people was fun and the hours were very flexible, which was nice. But I did not enjoy that the pay was so low, and that there were no benefits."
bad,"The pay is great for a retail job, HOWEVER management styles are all over the place. No one is truly on the same page and the rules get bent for the favorites. Very intense selling environment, like being in a shark tank. If you don't have thick skin I wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,If you are single and can move around it might be barely tolerable. However do not expect any praise or any compassion from management. You will not be compensated for extra time spent and will not be treated with respect.
bad,"I enjoy dealing with customers, but the sales quota is stressing me out.  It is impossible to reach most of the time.  Lunch breaks are decent and the benefit is ok."
bad,you would be often be over a large area of the work floor by yourself. which would be difficult when there is new shipment in that you need to assort and get out on to the floor properly and out of the way. While trying to look out for wondering customers and make sales to meet your daily quota. So if you happened to be busy doing one thing other employees who had nothing to do in there area would wonder around to other areas and look for customers to sale to.
bad,"Working in the store is different than the corporate world.  The environment is good if you have a supportive leader in management.  Without support, there's not much success.  Lots of long hours standing.  Your pay is based on your sales.  Even if you have a large increase in sales, but your ""sales per hour"" is not at the correct number they want it to be, you will never get a raise.  They normally do not consider over-achievement.  I have never had a pay cut, but I did my job and what I was supposed to do. I went above and beyond to bring Dillard's more money and profit, I never got a raise..."
bad,"Upper management often abusive toward lower managers. ASMs often tasked with impossible goals without necessary resources to accomplish them, often resulting in extended hours and working days off."
bad,I worked for Dillard's for almost a year and the management was eh they always acted very superior and made it seem like they were better than everyone. Dillard's has the habit of making the associate do everything but make you still focus on your sales and it sucks especially if you're a part timer because they usually give you like 3/5 hour shifts and your supposed to sell hundreds of dollars but the store is empty especially during the weekdays. Yes the pay is good and they are very flexible for students but if you don't sell you will get fired and they almost blame you for not selling to customers that are not there. In the department I worked in my coworkers were amazing we got along very well and we always got our work done.
bad,Job is very much labor intensive! Crazy daily sales quota -many lose their jobs within the first 3 months for failing to meet the quota. Very hard to meet the sales quota when you have 10 other sales associates in your department scheduled at the same time!
bad,"This ""job"" was on an unfair quota system in which if you did not meet during your work week not only will your pay be reduced but you were at a high risk of termination. This system affective the employee morale in a very hostile way. Co-workers from diffrent areas on the sales floor would steal customers from others just to make their quota."
bad,go to work and do waxing 
bad,They weren’t fair they pick who they really any after we sign our review. They tell us we need to do whatever it takes if it means getting help from other associates but they let me go and nobody else.
bad,"Management does not value hard working employees, only cares about numbers and sees their employees as easily replaceable. They need to have their managers focus more time on training employees."
bad,"I was not pleased by the lack of management's concern of whether or not the zero tolerance policy that was in place was enforced or not."
bad,"Dillard’s is a good company to work with, when you have the right people and the right management. When I first started I loved it, I was sorrounded by so many great people and great managers, and I enjoyed going to work, after a year when lots of managers decided to leave and we got lots of new managers who would treat employees badly, call us names sometimes, or even yell at us."
bad,"Good pay, great customers. The upper management need training in conversing with the associates. Always rude and demeaning, especially if they feel you're not making at least $2500 in sales per day. Even in hurricane situations...."
bad,"Absolutely the worst place to work. All of the managers use fear as a management tool. They will publicly humiliate you, talk down to you, and make you anxious to go into work everyday. The employees are generally the same. Very catty and unfriendly. However, the benefits and pay rates are great."
bad,Working at Dillards was a nightmare. Management was rude. The pressure of meeting your quota was hard enough. You risked paycut if you didn't meet your quota. Management was caught stealing. Horrible environment.
bad,"Management is difficult, not willing to budge on recommended changes. Lack of communication within the company.  Day to day job deems stressful, many fire drills on a daily basis with no support from management."
bad,Management promised many things upon hiring but quickly it became apparent that they had no intention on following through. Managers would gossip and share employee sales numbers and personal information. Terrible work environment.
bad,they pay you based on sales. if your sales are great and they have to raise your pay they will move you to a section of the store where the sales are hard to make
bad,Dillard is all about the dollar and not the employee the pay is lousy .Too much micromanagement.  Glad to be away.  You have to work all holidays. No time for your  personal life.
bad,"I am not very likely to recommend the job to anyone. It is a good place to work as far as money goes, but management is poor and there is no job security whatsoever."
bad,"The best thing about this job was the people you worked with, and some times you have some customers that come in and make you smile. more or less you were on commission. they start you out at 11.00 hour but you have to sale enough shoes to cover your wages plus you have to meet a 3 thousand goal each month to keep your job. I believe that was an unreachable goal. so with in three months all the employees i work with were gone. The only way you can make that goal is at christmas when people are being boots for hundreds of dollars, but then it gets hectic, other employees will take your customers way from you, and you lose your hard work. The other thing is you debt carries over month to month, but not your profits if you can meet their goals and pay your salary plus more you do not see a kick back for the extra you sold or the extra profits will not carry in to the next month. You need to be on the floor most of the time to make it but most if not all your days you are stuck in the back stocking."
bad,It has been a while since I worked for Dillards. I really don't know any of the managers there now. Im sure the rest is the same. The insurance wasn't bad. It is a good place to work if you are putting yourself through school but not if you have a family to support. You have to work weekends.
bad,The bank moved to Gilbert and they were not going to compensate any employees for moving or travel expenses.  It did not make sense to stay at this company.
bad,"As a sales associate working there for about a year I made a lot of good friends with other coworkers Unfortunately the managers are not professionals"
bad,"management never cared what employees were doing, could go days without hearing from management. Also ignored all attempts to improve ones self and to advance in the company."
bad,"Loved my job and co-workers. Management made the job stressful, always wanting more, causing many great employees to leave. When I was hired, I was told they would find me a full time position, more hours, that I had proved myself and it would not be a problem. This never happened. Eventually, the hours for part time employees became inconsistent, again, causing employees to have to leave to find something that offered more hours."
bad,"Dillard's culture is not ideal. You're not cared for as an employee or appreciated. Yes they do the occasional cake or cupcakes but only when bad news is brought. Ive worked there 4 months and cake has been brought twice, bad news once and one other time to celebrate a perfect attendance for Q1 for another employee. It was the first one since the studio opened 6 years ago so that shows you how much people need a break. Whether you have the talent for a certain position or not usually you are not considered, someone from the outside will be brought in. And the manager doesn't even acknowledge that you emailed and applied to the position. You are simply ignored. They are a very money hungry company and the benefits are from the bottom of the barrel. They would rather hire someone who has no experience in the position because they can underpay them. One manager (in the photo studio specifically) dictates everyone. Even the other two managers that are there. People wonder why the turnover rate is so high, its because of that manager. Employees and other managers are always barked at and talked to like they are 7 years old. It is not a good environment to be in."
bad,I have met some amazing people while working at Dillard's but management is absolutely terrible. Managers do not care about the well being of their employees.
bad,"My job required me to sell cosmetic products to customers and work primarily in the fragrance department. I would provide consultations, up sell products, and work with the rest of the cosmetic team to achieve our sales goals on a monthly basis. I learned the importance of having a strong clientele, being accountable for sales, and how to work as a team. The most challenging part of the job was there was never any job security and policies were always changing. Management would let go of employees on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to work in a fun upbeat environment."
bad,"Great perk is the employee discount! You will have to make your own review of the company. I have nothing to disclose about this company. The only thing I will say,is that the company does things that you will not see at any other retail establishment. And there was an article in the Huffington Post that rated the company as #2 in the nation as the worst company to work for."
bad,If you do not make your hourly goal then out the door you go.  Doesn't matter how long you've worked there or other things you do  to improve your department.
bad,I would only recommend this job to someone who is retired and just wants to get out of the house. Dillard's has outrageous SPH goals that are nearly impossible. Coworkers are shady. It is a dog eat dog world.
bad,"The dillards I worked for had a very high turnover rate, making it impossible to get to know co-workers. I worked with kids that didn't take their job seriously and could often be found hiding behind a display playing on their phones. My manager was good, but most of the managers in the store are terrible people. They will not work with your schedule. People were gossipy and rude. The store breeds severe competition between co workers. Do not expect to make friends."
bad,"If you can go to work, do your job, don't interact with employee drama, and don't expect any gratitude for all your hard work...THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!"
bad,"You can't really move up in the company because your numbers are the key to everything. If the traffic of the store is good, you have a chance but not in slower places. The pay is great and has spoiled me but they are quick to cut your pay or fire you."
bad,"Not a good experience working in this store.   To much pressure for the sales and the traffic of the store is really slow.  Salary is good, but is not worth it because of the pressure."
bad,"My day would usually start knowing I was in deficit for the month, and knowing it was just going to keep getting worse, during the month of December we were supposed to do $6000 a day, and when there's no customers, it makes it impossible. I knew I would be losing my job when my review came up, this is why I opted to quit. By the time you decide to leave, you'll be soulless."
bad,"I went into this job knowing about having a sales quota but I didn't know it was going to be so high! People around this area do not want to spend over $30 on a shirt when there are cheaper ones in the mall. They give you hope in the interview that you have a chance after your first review, but even if you are a little bit behind, they will fire you. Just be cautious if you do take the job."
bad,"Its a typical retail job, if you open you have to count all there registers in your area and the same if you close. You help customers, ring them up, put out new merchandise and do markdowns, It would be worth the $12.00 and hour they start you off with if it weren't so competitive. Grown women in other departments would come over and take a sale right in front of you and god forbid if you it to them. The managers say they will take them about it but then encourage them to keep stealing the sales. If you don't make your sales goals they fire you. Which is pretty reasonable but the daily goals are calculated by all the Dillard's in the the district soo if you work at a really dead mall you're screwed. I was expected to make $800 dollars a day but could barely get half of that on good days, and returns count against you so there were days I would get negative sales. There was no way I was gonna make my goal. The managers decided to fire me at my 3 month review but never actually told me, or gave me a chance to bring my numbers up. They let me work through the holiday season and let me go blaming it on a review I never actually had. Also they understaffed all the areas. They would put one person in all of the home department which is half the store and expect people from other departments to go check on the area.If you don't mind a competitive workplace with little chance of advancing than you can definitely work here. They only thing that made it worth it were the girls that worked in the same area as me."
bad,"I helped customers and put clothing back where it belongs.  When you call in sick, there is a mark against you.  If you feel sick, they have over the counter remedies available so you won't leave.  Nobody asks how you are feeling.  It's all about you need to stay whether or not you are sick."
bad,"Very easy job for the most part. The line between customer service and cashiering becomes very blurred the longer you work. Holidays and weekends are the most stressful times for an associate, fairly easy sales requirements. Compensation is OK. The work environment is pretty drab. Customers always lighten the mood, but it's sort of depressing honestly. Management makes sure everyone knows they're expendable."
bad,"Dillard's makes violation on their employees everyday. Work at Sunday's 6 hours with no 15 minutes break is unhuman. People have to hide to eat a little snack. If you're closing you most wait till management release you. Sometimes there problems in other departments at the closing and you have to wait till they solve the problems and then you can leave. In my case I use public transportation and they don't care about how they can affect their employees. "
bad,"Great company if you are looking to work PT.not a company I would try to make a Career .  Upper Management not friendly..arrogant..and not team players..Dept managers Amazing!!  If not for them ..everyone would have a miserable time. If quotas not met they cut salary..not a good trend in these times. Seasonal work or Temp applicants will find this better suited for them."
bad,"The job itself is a great job! Working with the people is so much fun and being able to merchandise the floor is the best. The coworkers are nice and the job is very people involved, management is not the best but okay sometimes. You have to meet a sales goal so it makes the job kinda stressful. Its not for everyone, its difficult"
bad,"In a typical day, I will have to prepare myself to deal with some co workers that will do their best to jeopardize my job. I am an energetic sales person and jealousy is the word of the day in that environment, In the other side, love retail sales, love to interact with customers!! :)"
bad,"Lots of hours, not a lot of compensation. A salaried manager with Dillard's works most of their days off. A typical day is 10-12 hours."
bad,"A typical day at Dillard's was spent unpacking new merchandise, greeting customers, assisting customers and shoe sales. I learned how to up-sell, how to work with commission, etc "
bad,"Daily sales goals were so high, they were nearly unobtainable for most workers: therefore caused an overly stressed and competitive environment with job instability; in turn, employment and promotion was then based on managements own personal discretion. I have learned to work hard and effective without positive reinforcement or proper training. I have learned to work well under pressure. I've learned to begin and maintain trustworthy relationships interfacing with the public. I have overcome shyness with strangers and built up confidence. I have learned how to maintain a positive attitude under any circumstance. The most enjoyable part of my job is interfacing with the public and building relationships."
bad,"A typical day at work is very slow due to the location of the business, which is in the middle of nowhere. I learned how to use the cash register, which is very old. The manager does not want to spend money to update anything. It took awhile to understand how to operate it, because it was hard to see the screen. The only thing I learned was how to approach customers to get them to buy something. We rarely order items for customers, so I left that job still not knowing how to make orders."
bad,"No benefits for Sales associates and for the people who work in the dock. Managers would not let us exceed over 28 hours because they didn't want to give anyone benefits. Was fully ignored by manager but when i did make my sells she would finally talk to me. Very competitive atmosphere, sales impossible to make."
bad,Shark Tank is how I sum it up. Unobtainable goals in sales onl of holidays
bad,"A typical day at work for me is selling shoes"
bad,"A typical day of work consist of meeting the daily quota and making up for any other day that you are behind. I learned how to work in a competitive environment. The management was ok. There were some managers that were awesome and helped me with anything that I needed. Some co-workers were mean because we had to compete for the sales, but some were really nice and fair."
bad,"Lack of communication through out the stores. Poor compensation for managers. good employee discount, good management experience."
bad,"During my long time there, more than fifty employees came and went as a result of the terrible management, pressure, and lack of job security."
bad,"a typical day at work is nothing but stress. if sales are down, you are threatened on a daily basis. They will cut your pay if you don't meet the required sales and open up company credit apps to customers. after they cut your pay, if you don't make up the amount of sales you are behind, you are then fired. The management is nice but the hardest part is making sales."
bad,The company itself doesn't give you the opportunity to move up within. It also doesn't give you the chance to be fulltime unless your a manager.
bad,"I was a ok workplace, but competitive among coworkers.  However customer service is a important part of the company."
bad,"Management is rude and not very understanding of medical conditions. Management makes it a very hostile working environment, were fellow employee's are able to use racial slurs and assault you, without any disciplinary action."
bad,very poor management not a nice place to work proceed at your own risk. for the desperate
bad,No structure. No growth.
bad,"Management is lazy. When somewone leaves, they'll wait a couple weeks to find a new emplyee, while having other employees work 50 or more hours to make up for lost coverage. Wait till last minuste to make a schedule. Everyone is constantly fighting over sales because if they're sales are too low for a while, theyre fired. This leads to bad customer service, only about 7 out of 40 employees will know how to keep good customer service. Management ignores the employees, hardly talks to them, while just watching them over a camera."
bad,"My typical day would consist of taking shopping transactions and providing customer service. I also had other duties such as keeping up my department, stocking, marking down merchandise, and setting up merchandise displays."
bad,"A typical day was setting up dish displays, putting away stock like towels, appliances etc. I learned a lot from my coworkers who actually trained me. The hardest part was unloading 40-50 lb items without being taught proper bending to prevent pain or injury. I enjoyed registering brides and helping them pick items for their registry."
bad,"I was very impressed with this company upon employment. I felt a sense of family values. But I was quickly awaken. I have come to realize this store is so unfair and doesn't value moral rights and race is a factor in decisions. I have been very dissatisfied with issues happening where race is the only factor. And if you have an opinion about these issues, your job security is then optional."
bad,Management was innappropriate with staff. It had a good starting pay and I was exceeding my goals and about to get a raise until they moved me to a slow department until I missed my raise before they moved me back to where I'd started.
bad,Company is not fair...They dont care about employees they care about how much you can bring to the company or if you are not making your sale your done...No job security! Im sorry buts its true
bad,This was a decent job but when sales dropped the company would lay off associates
bad,"Dillard's Inc. is a family owned business that focuses mainly on sales. If you do not maintain your sales and credit app quota, then you are at risk of losing your job. Management is horrible, and from what I understand by having friends that work at Dillard's locations in other cities, this is across the board. I will say that Dillard's does pay well, however they expect you do do the work in order to earn that pay. Your sales quotas are going to be ridiculously high, and if you do not get one credit app per week, they will not give you a weekend off. They do not give sufficient breaks, you will probably be expected to work 11:45 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., sometimes 10:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m without being scheduled for a break. And they will tell you that if you're not scheduled for a break, to not take one. Which in many states is quite ILLEGAL."
bad,Working at dillards was okay. Your hours are not flexable much and they start you off good but dock your pay if you cant meet the sales goal which is outrageous but yet you are not commission based.
bad,good place to meet nice people everyday and good co-workers that you can meet people.....but overall its like a competion to make sales.
bad,Dillards was a ok place to work .You learn how to sell under alot of presure and you had to make a quato based on you salary if you where making alot your where expected to do alot of selling . The best part of the job was you got to meet some of the best people in the town and you had wonerful co workers. You also learn how to operate computer cashi register
bad,From the outside a fun place to work. They tell you all the pro when hired. Once you work there a while the cons come out. Must get company's credit card weekly or you lose your weekends off. If your sales are to low you receive a pay cut or lose your job.
bad,I worked here for a few months. It was a iterresting place to work
bad,"Dillard's welcomed me as a Sales Manager; however, 2 weeks into being hired the Store Manager left while new Store Manager decided to clean house and bring in staff from his other store. The visual appearance is appauling with dated furniture, carpet, and fixtures."
bad,I put in plenty application no one never written or email me to let me know if they received my application or not. Macy's have great feed back on job applicants.
bad,You will always be busy working at Dillard's. A typical shift would consist of around 6-7 hours and you would constantly be working on something. Professional dress was always required and schedules were not very flexible.
bad,"The first 30 days things were great, the managment was supportive. My department manager was fantastic, so great at answering questions and helping me learn all the ins and hours of the home department. A year later a new store manager and ops manager took over and everything went down hill. Everyone's sph went way up and long term employees were getting pay cuts. Which is what happened to me, then people were getting let go. So I agree with the sentiment that Dillards is stuck in the 50s. No department store uses sales per hour anymore and Dillards needs to follow."
bad,"Management is not trustworthy, pay is poor and ethics are nonexistent. Company refuses to change with the times and blames associates for company’s shortfalls"
bad,"If you are a full time employee, the pay and benefits MIGHT be worth all the incompetencies presented by the management team. Multiple managers will be MIA or leave the store while they are supposed to be there because they are salaried. Managers will not handle customer complaints unless begged to do so. Managers also openly gossip about and make fun of employees to--and in front of--other employees and managers. Associate satisfaction is also an unknown concept to the management team at Dillard's in Tallahassee. They only care about customers and will tell employees to suck up any form of abuse (verbal/mental/physical) in order to drive sales and get credit applications processed. I was physically and verbally abused multiple times by employees and customers before I realized that Dillard's would do nothing to prevent or compensate employees from instances of assault which occur while working. I would not advise getting a job here unless you are desperate, or do not mind working with awful and inconsiderate managers."
bad,"A typical day included sales floor assistance. However, work hours steady but workplace culture unstable. The hardest part was you work hard and not given support in achieving the goals instructed to meet."
bad,"They took over my life and hardly gave me a day off   I worked many evenings and every holiday. I worked 5 years and NO raise or promotion   I did the job of a manager and never got recognized for it  "
bad,"Place is awful if you call out sick they make you catch up on your hours for that week. High sales goals and no business in store. "
bad,"The individuals who work there are really good people, but the management and the way they run their business needs to change, it makes it an uncomfortable environment for both customers and employees."
bad,I love the job and the new challenges it brings but the culture is really bad. Only sph matters. the management is corrupt. To many wrong people are in power. There's no job security even if you do your best.
bad,"The pay is good, for what you do. I hated begging people to apply for their credit cards. As an employee, you could only use their credit card, to use your discount. You also pay a lot for their health insurance."
bad,The work environment can range from great to toxic.  Management plays favorites.  Beware of sharks on the sales floor.  Very hard to get promoted if your not making sales and unrealistic sales goals that in reality are designed so the pace setters are the only ones able to achieve them.
bad,"Upper management, store manager and operations manager in particular, are horrendous. They are condescending and do not respect their employees whatsoever. The only thing they care about is money in their pockets and if that means belittling the workers then so be it. Sales goals are almost impossible to meet and very unrealistic. It’s 2019 and a lot of customers are taking their business online and that should reflect in sales expectations (operations manager has even admitted to online shopping when she could get it at Dillards, but still expects us to meet our sales when she won’t even support us). Malls are not the first choice when it comes to shopping and Dillard’s can’t seem to come to terms with that fact. There is no HR department so if you have any issue with upper management nothing ever gets solved, it only causes more drama to try and get corporate involved because nothing is anonymous."
bad,"The expectations are far too high for the reward. Department stores are a dying business and instead of changing with the time Dillards puts more pressure on their employees. They aren’t fair, ask you to come in sick and injured, overwork you, harass you, and blame you for that smallest things. It’s a fine temporary job, but I would hesitate thinking of it as a career. Side note: We had a dock worker actually have a stroke and later die on the sales floor. They didn’t even close the store, there was no counseling or anything for the employees who witnessed it. And all management did was send a card to the family."
bad,Great place to work when it comes to customers but sale goals are unrealistic. They set rules but are only held to certain people and some people can do whatever they want because management allows that kind of behavior. Problems cannot be solved since management allows only some to not follow rules.
bad,When I first started working here it was good but the pressure they put on making your quota is really high for a dying industry. Management is terrible they will change your schedule last minute and cut you short on hours with no notice
bad,"The sales goals are difficult to reach. If your area has to many other sales associates in it while your working that doesn't help you reach your goals either. Employees argue over wether the other one took their sale.   I haven't been there long enough to experience this first hand but apparently your pay can be deducted if you don't meet your goals after your yearly review. If you dont like the idea of asking customers to sign up for a credit card or doing pre-sales this job is not for you. I have witnessed favoritism. I wasn't making my goals from back when I worked with 2 other people in my small area (we were taking turns with sales,trying to be fair) and my manager said I was only worth $5 an hour."
bad,"I worked at a Dillard's where the same people have been in the same positions for 19 or 20 years. There's absolutely no room for advancement, I got laughed at when I inquired about moving positions. "
bad,"Working at Dillards is really work because besides doing your job you must contend with management and their insecurities. The management doesn't want employees talking to one another or going to lunch with one another. So you must sneak to do those things. Once they see you have the same lunch with a co-worker(friend) they change your lunch time. They will change your work schedule without your knowledge so you end with ""tardies"" or ""no call no shows""."
bad,Great when u 1st start. Then the chip away at your salary and start giving you decreases in pay for not hitting quotas. Policies always changing and not alot of direction.
bad,"Great co-workers,loved my job. Biggest problem was management. Wanted you to be independent on your job,but always over riding your way of doing things. Never any support,only negitivity. Poorly managed!"
bad,"Whether or not you like working here will depend entirely on the people you work with. I worked well with my first store manager, but after she got promoted the entire culture changed for the worse."
bad,"Management was absolutely terrible! Upper management included. There were many things going on with lower management that when reported, nothing would be done. I had a manager scream in my face in the middle of the department in front of customers. She had an issue with asking for you to take mainly focus on merchandising andtl then out of no where complain and be on you because you aren't making your sales goal. The store was slow as it was so I certainly can't fight the other employees over sales when I'm in the back corner doing merchandise. When I finally spoke back up to her she decided she wanted me to go to the office with her and talk. She began yelling even louder back there and threatened me with ""you need to decide if you want this job or not"" I was in tears and finally was like wait a minute, this isn't worth keeping this low end job over. I told her she needed to learn to treat people with respect in order to get it back, that if she learned how to speak to people and ask instead of hatefully demand things, we may be more willing to get things done better. Then I finally said I won't deal with you treating me this way anymore I quit and walked out the door. She followed behind telling me please don't go, I'm sorry you're right. Please come back and talk to me. I went back thinking wow maybe it got her attention and after that she never bothered me again but there were still issues with other management. Enough was enough after the January 1st sale. The competition for sales is insane. It's like shark eat shark in there. I've seen customers get very upset at how"
bad,while the pay is weekly and awesome the stress is unbareable . everyone is fighting over sales and hates each other . the management bullies you and threatens to fire you everyday if you dont meet their crazy goals
bad,"While many people know retail is not the most glamorous industry, DIillards is one of the most dulling, unmotivating, and honestly depressing jobs Iv had. The management (with some exceptions) were overworked, and not good leaders and were barley involved in the day to day activities. While there were days where there were things to do, most days were slow and pretty boring, mainly because there were hardly any customers. We also had a sales and credit card quota we were required to make every month (SPH sales per hour). Now, if there were barley any customers coming in, only a few people were going to make sales. My coworker and friend was fired when their review was up because they were not making sales, and they had been there about 2 years. We were either had way to much to do and got overworked, or it was the complete opposite. Hours and pay were not terrible, but it was not enough to keep many of the people there. They have a very high turnover rate and that alone should tell you a lot about management and how the company is run."
bad,"Long hours with little pay and very few benefits, medium level work stress, required to open credit cards for cutomers which can be difficult. Would never work there again!"
bad,Great company to work for.  The saying that people stay because of the people they work for is absolutely the truth.  I'd give this place 30 more years if it were not for the store management.
bad,I use to work 8 hours and I was never paid enough to meet my expenses. The work is not defined and you had to do different roles but no benefit are offered specicific. Expensive health insurance is offered and Pay raise system and evaluation system is very poor
bad,The job itself is great the customers are as well however management is very rude and so are the associates everything is a competition and they don't mind talking bad about you behind your back or to your face
bad,"I just needed a job at the time. I don't really have much of a review, It was hard working on my feet every day for that many hours. The only time I was not on my feet was during breaks, & lunch."
bad,One of the worst employment experiences I have ever had in my life...and I wasnt no young thing at the time. Sales ..nothing about your job performance held ANY weight at ALL... OTHER than sales numbers.
bad,You can easily get retail experience. As far a long term employment you can forget it. Their over turn rate is high and they have a revolving door. They're firing and hiring people almost every week or so. They lie to you in your face at the interview.  There's a lot of cut throats and back stabbers.
bad,"A typical day at work we have a many tacks to be done ."
bad,"Management will only side with senior associates. I worked in Active and the Sunday - Wednesday manager was the absolute worst, he will NOT take your issues into consideration. The pay is decent, if you make percentage. Managers have favorites and your grievance will be void if you are not a favorite. Dillards does not have advancement opportunities. The workers come and go. Working in the warehouse will drain you unless you are use to foot and back pain. The woman in HR is NO HELP."
bad,"Although the pay is decent, that's about the only good thing about working for Dillard's. They have unreasonable sales goals to meet, and harsh punishment for not meeting said goals. Management was an absolute joke, they do not care about you at all. You are nothing to corporate."
bad,Dillard's is probably a great company. Unfortunately the management at the time was not so great. This could have changed by now as I know the manager from my old store was terminated shortly after I left.
bad,"At your six months review you either get a raise, and higher sales goal or you get fired. Good luck. Managers do not care about you, just about your numbers. They do not have a problem making you cry or emotionally hurting you if they feel you aren't working to your fullest potential."
bad,I loved working with my customers. Liked my coworkers liked the fast pace loved my discount. Liked selling shoes.i like working in retail. I did not like the long hours 10 to 12 hours sometimes very few weekends off and too many weeks bolcked for vacation. I have nothing more to add it was a good place to work for the time i was there it just no longer worked for me.
bad,"overall great company to work for. however, the sales requirements are a bit unreal. the location plays a huge factor in sales growth that are individually set. difficult to achieve ."
bad,its a ver slow environment they do not advertise but they expect you to make unrealistic numbers which make its very competitive  they do try to low ball you when it comes to pay if you are not knowledgeable
bad,"Dillard's is a stress factor. Your their slave and can't do anything but work at Dillard's and go home. Management does not work with your schedule, your constantly getting into a dispute with other associates over a sale. You can be on time, never call in, sale $260K per year, open credit, work as a team and it's not good enough. You get a pay cut because you didn't reach your goal but the whole store goal wasn't meet because it was no business. Stress should be Dillard's name. You don't have a personal life working at Dillard's. You can't move up to management or become a team leader, your just an associate."
bad,Worked full time with no benefits. Management was always stressed. Pay was great. Always had your schedule in a months advance which was nice. very understanding if you called in because your kid was sick. Hour lunch breaks.
bad,"Give out goals, set bench marks freshen up visual displays.  Having a new store manager whose purpose was to terminate all managers and created low moral in all departments."
bad,"Dillard's is a very competitive place to work at. You need to reach a goal of sales you have to make throughout the day. Mostly every day you will never reach that goal. After three months, if you haven't reached your standard goal then you will be terminated. It is very hard to reach, so I don't recommend this job to anyone. You also can't move to full time if you've reached your goal. The hours and the pay is horrible."
bad,"They will set you up to fail over and over again. They dock pay if you don't hit quotas (they don't tell you either, you figure it out in your pay check), they will ""transfer"" you if you continue to fail, which you will."
bad,"Enjoy the work, just not happy with their evaluation methods.   Do not evaluate performance the way it should be, not 95% based on the dollars you bring in. Almost impossible to make the quotas that they ask for."
bad,"Schedule was flex-able and worked well with current full time job. Managers were great with the training aspect.  Co-workers were good to work with, they were fair and considerate."
bad,"This place is not a enjoyable place to work, the sales expectations that they require are unrealistic. It's all about favoritism, if you kiss enough behind you get ahead, the cosmetics manager is the most unprofessional, ghetto trash, always gossiping about all of her employees. They talk about how excellent their training is, but I didn't receive the luxury of formal training until almost 7 months into the job."
bad,"Ive worked for better and Ive worked for worse.There's both good"
bad,"Management requires the impossible from employees, even when the rest of the store is suffering. They set impossible expectations, and fire those that were set up to fail from the jump. There is a fear of loosing your job every 6 months after review. The compensation is great, but not worth sanity."
bad,"Overall Dillard's was an enjoyable employment opportunity to learn about sales, customer relations, and multitasking responsibilities. A typical day at Dillard's as a sales associate looks like this; go in, find out how much you need to sale for the day, what kind of chores, tasks need to be done throughout the day and then sale while keeping up with said daily responsibilities from cleaning to organizing merchandise. The only negative about working with the College Station Dillard's was the upper management, to me store managers and assistant mangers, etc. should lead by example and work with floor associates to improve sales and motivate and help out when it's busy or whenever any general help is needed that area mangers are unable to help. Unfortunately that is not the case here, upper management here stays in their office all day and give demands over phone calls whether it be from improving sales or making up work hours or anything in general; all while doing this in a VERY negative and deconstructive manor. Although the pay and the work itself is great for the difficulty of tasks, when you have to work for people who almost seem to purposely want their employees to fail, it makes the work environment almost unbearable."
bad,Management was rude to work for because i was young. I worked in the childrens department by myself and when i asked to have someone put into my area they put an elderly lady in my area who could not and would not perform the tasks.
bad,I hated working for Dillard's. The only good thing about working there was the people i met.the employee was nice. the food court was convenience when i didn't bring lunch.
bad,"I will give Dillard's credit for it's schedule flexibility. If you have a doctor's appointment or need to take medical/family leave they will try their best to work with you. Their starting pay is also quite decent when compared to similar positions in other stores."
bad,"management sucked you were a number, your pay goes down if you dont meet certain goals wich causes the fellow employees to be cutthroat and steal your sales its very Competive wich is how the management wants it to be."
bad,"Dillards has great company values but not family orientated."
bad,"This company is a wood chipper for employees, the average employee lasts 6 months at best. I worked here for nearly 2 years and all but a few faces were brand new by the time I exited for a better opportunity. They pay pretty well, starting pay is about 12 an hour, but the more you make the more you have to sell, no matter what the business looks like it will always be your fault on why you didn't do more, returns count against your sell numbers. Dillards tries to focus on customer service, although from my experience the average customer uses dillards as a showroom for amazon, to get the products at a much better price. Not a long term job, not a bad job if you need something for the summer or a school semester."
bad,"New and moved associates are trained by other associates in an assigned department, which these stationed associates are not properly trained or compensated for teaching a new associate how to sell and maintain the department they are placed. It is drilled into every new hire that the most important part of their job is making sales. It causes many associates to not work together, also a hostile work environment. While the new hires are selling to nearly every customer, the seniority associates are making sure the department is clean and organized and their SPH suffers every time. Oftentimes, by senority and new hires, Quota cards are confused with SPH goals, which are both important but the SPH numbers determine pay-cuts and pay raises and many associates don't realize that. Review times are scheduled at the company's convenience in the worst interest of the sales associates. For instance, upon approaching a busy time for the store a review will be scheduled before a particular event or holiday or way after so the associates will not have time to bring their numbers up because of the slow times. A sales associate has many duties and help customers the best they can, but none of that counts unless a sale is made. Associates can receive special hours if they are requested by management to do tasks and parts of merchandising. With years of working there, ASM's do forget to put in special hours too often.Another issue is scheduling, you can work anywhere from 5-14 days straight, get one day off and another stretch. Every month is different, not even seniority gets set hours. Also,"
bad,"Excellent starting pay for new associates.  However, if you don't make your sales goal, you may take a pay cut as a result."
bad,"As a sales associate our tasks were to service customers, merchandise the department, and cashier.  We had a sales quota to meet every day and we would get a raise every year if we reach our sales goals.  This environment was very competitive however my coworkers and I always knew how to maintain a good friendship with one another and help each other out when needed with our sales.  The good thing about the company is that there is room for growth if upper management approves."
bad,I had a great team of associates however wasn't always as busy as we would have liked for it to be so if associates they lose money
bad,I learned that Dillard's has extreme favorites and management is very lax and they do NOT actually see how lazy the employees are which causes the employees who aren't lazy to pick up the slack of others.
bad,"Needs management adjustment in several areas. Always a lot of  inconsistency, non-supportive remarks, unrealistic goals. Never gives positive feedback. You need all of these to build a good sales team. "
bad,"Pay is decent for a retail job, however there is no job security.  The bottom line its all about money.  It doesn't matter how well you do your job or handle your customers."
bad,Dillard's was a great place to work in the beginning however it did become a very hostile and uncomfortable place to work.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of calling customer's, harassing customer's to try your product and pushing Clarisonic facial brushes on everyone."
bad,"Was constantly being badgered about not making the ""numbers""...sales were off due to lack of people in the store as well as an economy where women did not want to spend $39, on mascara."
bad,"I lasted all of 2 and half weeks.  I really thought Dillards would have been a lot better to work for, and boy was I wrong.  First of all you go to a training meeting for 1 night, it all sounds good and proper and then with no more training they throw you out onto the floor to be trained by current employees. If you are lucky enough, you might get a veteran employee to work with, but you will also get training by someone who has only been there a few more weeks than you.  Management was awful. Oblivious to what is going on out on the floor. They do there quick walk through a time or two a day and avoid the departments that need the most work. Have all smiles and are like robots saying SELL, SELL, SELL. You have a sales quota and are expected to sign up so many credit applications a week. In our town it was not near as easy as it may be in some.  This causes a lot of tension and drama between the workers. don't understand the meaning behind this. People are going to buy what they want anyway and they sure don't want some pest following them around. Hours are not that great, and there is a lot of work to be done. Sure pay starts out good 11 to 12 $ an hour, but in no time if you don't sell, that will be lowered very quickly.  A job should be fun and not stressful, this one sure isn't that way."
bad,"Very disorganized and poorly managed company.  They pay a little higher then most department stores, but also give you unobtainable sales goals.  They hire anyone, so you will end up working with a bunch a lazy immature teenagers. Then of course there are the ones in their twenties who act like they know everything even though I have been working longer then they have been alive.  Overall not a good job to have."
bad,cut throat atmosphere causes customers to be nervous and unapproachable.
bad,"There are unrealistic sales goals that need to be met if you want to keep your job. Sometimes there are no customers, but that does not matter to management."
bad,"A typical work day included merchandising and customer service."
bad,Come to work in Men's Dept selling clothes putting outfits together for customer sometimes walk thru whole store helping customer management was really available except when setting up displays.Hardest part of job is trying to sell overpriced merchandise to customers enjoyable part is making your quota for the month.
bad,"Helping customers find what they need"
bad,"Typically, we had daily sales quotas to meet by selling the products in the department we are located in.  Though we were allowed to go and sell in other departments, it is difficult because most employees are like sharks.  In the eight months I was there, my area (Juniors) did not get a whole lot of traffic so that made things a bit difficult.  A lot of the time, I kept myself busy by finger spacing the racks, dressing mannequins, re-doing displays, re-organizing clothes, and color-coding the prom dresses area."
bad,"folding clothes and helping customers, management changed a lot frequent turnovers, very competitive sales environment"
bad,"- recovery is ridiculous"
bad,"Met great girls through here, but other then that, work environment is very poor. They give pay cuts, they don't advertise or really have sales so there's no foot traffic, management, especially store managers are god awful. Not only did I work there, but my mom worked there a few years later with al new management and it was till the same"
bad,"Dillard's pays on SPH, sales per hour, for associates.  There selling area is assessed a selling cost % and then that percentage times their hourly is how much they need to sell to pay for themselves.  It is often impossible to make this so associates are given a 20% pay decrease after 6 months unless they are in cosmetics then they have a year.  If they do not make it in the next 3 months after the decrease and new goal they are fired.  "
bad,Hard to reach daily sales goal. Management just wants a body in a section.
bad,The managers are very mean and do not work with you. you have a sph that is vey hard to meet they will cut your pay very fast
bad,"I worked there from February until September of this year (2013) and have been miserable the entire time. If you do ever work there, DO NOT try full time, unless you want to be constantly exhausted and have absolutely no home life. The average work week for a part time employee is about 28 hours (and only because they legally can't work you more than that). Full timers, however, will average closer to 45 hours per week on an average week. Holidays is a completely different story, though. Full time employees will average over 60 hours a week with very few days off. It's ridiculous how much they work their employees, I don't see how it's legal. If you work in the shoe department, they say you'll make commission, but they tax so much of it, you hardly ever see a dime. I don't recommend anyone ever work there, at least not until they get out of the stone ages and make some advancements with their policies and technology."
bad,Working here i learnt a lot of people skills and how to cook more things. I really enjoyed working with the crew that i worked with.
bad,"I was a Clinique beauty consultant. Absolutely enjoyed selling and representing the Clinique brand, but unfortunately I was considered as a Dillard employee. Being that this is a retail position, the hours were long, you're required to work some holidays with the exception of Christmas and Thanksgiving. All in all, it is a mediocre place to work."
bad,"Our day usually started with recovery, merchandising, customer service, price changes, displays.  I learned how to do displays so they caught the customer's attention.  The management was not friendly with the sales associate.  My co-workers were hard working people.  The hardest part was working very long hours.  The best part was pleasing the customers and learning new things."
bad,It is what it is. Dillard's is just another department store where you have to fight for sales. If you do not make your sales quota you are out of there.
bad,do stock every morning when you came in. After stock was done and put up on shlves you would open up registers and attend to customers.
bad,"A typical day working at Dillard's depends on the amount of traffic (customer's shopping). Dillard's has an aggressive sales environment, but not enough business to support the objectives. During my time at Dillard's I have learned how to cross-sell and give exceptional customer service. The hardest part of the job is meeting sales goals when the business isn't there. Very difficult during off seasons. The most enjoyable part are the additional discounts given to employees and getting paid weekly."
bad,I work at Dillard's inc. store 276. I've experience unfair treatment as if we were slave or kids. For a while we were lock in the store at night after closing procedures was done until the manager felt it was ok for us to leave. About a year ago we wasn't allowed a 15 minutes break on Sundays when we put in six hours. Also no matter how hard you work in the store.... Working hard as you can. If you don't make the sale you are fired. I think work ethic should be included in your yearly review. Also I've experience unfair treatment for a position. Dillard overall lately in trying to change. I won't say make Dillard a long term career. But I havent seen Dillard's treat the customer wrong. It's just behind the screen problems.
bad,Dillards provided me with the opportunity to further my customer service skills.
bad,"I have worked for Dillards (cosmetic department) for many years.I enjoy working with woman that need my help in finding the right products them.My job consist of many things,like using the phone , inviting clients in for events and up coming promotions.I have a large client list in CAD."
bad,"Dillard's used to be a great company to work for after talking to the associates that have worked for them for 15-20 years but now it seems like it has gone down hill. We have unrealistic quotas/sph to meet every month and if we don't meet them we have 30 days to catch up or find another job. Management is weird one day you'll have a great manager then the next you get one who doesn't know what they are doing.Training for new associates is bad.They don't take the time to show how to do anything, management just throws you out there and you pretty much on your own. They won't listen to ideas that would make the shopping experience better for customers. The associates you work with some are good and some bad but the customers make it all better. The pay is good but the health benefits eat up the whole check if you have a family."
bad,"Work as part time in customer service and sales. Bottom line, if you make you montly sales goal you got an increase in pay. Next months goal would be harder and harder.Much pressure and poor envirament."
bad,The hardest part about the job is having to meet a quota everyday. If you dont meet your quota every month then you can get a pay cut. I probley wouldnt recommend this company to a friend because you have very little room for advancement because it is so competitive. After awhile you realize you deserve more money for all the work you do and they are not willing to give it to you.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers.
bad,The store manager (who has now since been terminated) was horrible. They give ridiculous sales quotas you must meet but don't take into account the lack of traffic in the area you are working in.
bad,It was near impossible to make your given quota at Dillards. Then your pay was docked every 3 months for not reaching such a high quota.
bad,Was polo specialist for 8 years- and the store turned into an outlet store-no sales-just cashiers
bad,"Wasn't there long enough to really give an opinion nor did i gain anything benefits as a part time worker, however; i did admire the fashion and learn more about other high end designers."
bad,"Stressful, demanding job. Constant drama and spiteful tactics in attempt to meet necessary sales quota's. A lot of discrimination within this company. A career has become a job."
bad,"Enjoyed working for Dillard's the 1st 4yrs,  became difficult to many managers , bullying and threatening by management.  Won't allow weekends off for some employees.  Favor some over others. Unfair scheduling"
bad,I was promised promotions that I never received. My manager never spoke to me about my sales goals. In the men’s shoe department you get paid a commission there was some times that I didn’t make my quota. my pay got deducted by $2.  The only good thing that I really enjoyed about Dillards is getting paid every week weekly pay. I also enjoyed the one hour lunch.
bad,"Store manager only cares about numbers, assistant manager is ever rotating and usually come in on power trips and want to change everything and spend their days and evenings stalking employees on security cameras to micromanage and pick at every move. Raises are dependent on how much you sell and credit applications, not work performance or how well you have advanced the area. Work is never good enough always Presell IG for something to the point t your customers ask you to quit calling them. There is zero HR in the store so anyone can be walked out at anytime if you are not favored. Very little good things to say about this company. Thanksgiving off is about the only good thing...."
bad,"It was an ok job worked in womens shoes. I enjoyed the discount, and mostly all employees. Managers not so much. Hated Jan.1st sale complete madness and horrible day for employees! I wish it would go away!"
bad,Racism is alive and well at Dilliards.Always in danger of dismissal if quota not met. Which means a stessful environment. Employee watched more than customers. Only pale people promoted. No gratitude or Thanks ever given
bad,"Boring place to work, on feet all day, everyone gets"
bad,"unpack shoes , stock shoes, pull shoes, wait on customers. "
bad,"It's a retail job. Prepare for long hours and weekend work. Sales goals make for not a so-fun environment and lots of sales floor drama. Work with some great people and good management, but the job is not for everyone."
bad,Coworkers are catty and make it a hostile work environment. Managment is unprofessional and only cares about money. Employees are made to not feel special and threaten job security. The only good compensation is the pay but it's not worth what they put you through.
bad,Terrible management  just let anyone manage. I was Lord on by management and they try to write me up I just left God is good!!! I wouldn’t go back for nothing in the world
bad,Dillard's is a large workplace with multiple opportunities.  It is necessary to  sell and sustain sales figures in order to remain there in a career capapcity
bad,"Dillard's has an extremely high turnover rate, due to 1) sales goals that are hard to meet especially in a slow store/department 2) employees not being valued and appreciated for their hard work. All that matters is getting sales and credit apps. The environment is very negative because you are competing with your coworkers and manager(s) to make your goals so you don't get fired. Schedules were given out and changed at the last minute, so it's hard to make plans. I was told I'd get a weekend off every month but this did not happen until 3 months in. Honestly I liked my manager and the department I got put in but the job was so stressful it wasn't worth the $13/hr. I accepted a lower-paying position that is more flexible and promotes a positive work environment. If you're looking for some extra cash, Dillard's would be ok (they're always hiring!) but make sure you quit before you get fired for not meeting your goals."
bad,This is only a job for a person in college or an individual who already has a full time job and needs extra money on the side. The system of dillards is a revolving door. The longer you've worked there the more you are favored. They pay weekly but it doesn't really benefit much if you have bills.
bad,This is just a stepping stone. The pay isn't great the hours are terrible. The management is NOT supportive to employees. If you need a job this is just a position to start but keep looking else where.
bad,"A typical day as a salaried sales manager involves long hours chasing unrealistic sales goals. Salaried managers are supposed to be scheduled for 40 hours but we typically work 50 to 53 hours a week. There are only 2 shifts available to work.  There is no work/life balance. Your schedule could change at the drop of a dime regardless if you have plans. The associates are not  held accountable for their sales goals. With the new era of Amazon Prime, customers are not shopping at the level that they once were especially if there are no coupons or sales. Customers want incentives. Dillard's does not announce open positions. You typically hear about the open positions through the grapevine. There is a lot of favoritism shown by upper management. Instead of promoting from within, they have typically hired people from outside of the company."
bad,I hate it here...hated it the moment I was placed in shoes...The employees stands in groups and talk about people try and steal each others customer. The employees keeps something going.Everybody wants to be a manager it seems. Its slow and very boring to stand and watch customers walk past the shoe dept.
bad,"Maybe it was the kind of people I worked with, but it was always a tense environment. No one was really happy and the amount of stress every employee had from working there was unfathomable. Managers didn't really care about employees and were mostly just worried about themselves. There was always competition to sell, which wasn't the issue. The issue was how rude and spiteful employees were to each other because the competitiveness. It was hard to do my job because other people would belittle my effort and then turn around take it for themselves. It's very troubling how that store runs."
bad,"Management is a joke, they won’t treat you with respect unless you’re constantly brown-nosing them. Sales expectations are set too high intentionally so that you can (and will) be let go at any time to management’s liking. I’ve been working here for almost a year, and the only thing that has kept me there is the pay."
bad,"Managers will ignore requests for time off, taking breaks is looked down upon even though they won’t say anything, managers are more concerned with watching employees than helping them, and closing shifts end up staying 10+ minutes late most days. You can’t even get the discount without opening a credit card"
bad,"The worst company that I have ever worked for."
bad,Unrealistic sales plan and under staffing with unfair goals. The leadership mislead you in thinking that you are working at a great pace to blind side you with a counsel on work preformance. This company has no real HR dept to stay in compliance with their own company policies. A total waste of time.
bad,Very poor management that was very unapproachable. All of my co workers were great however minus a few. It’s almost impossible to get full time hours and they fool you into thinking it’s high pay but won’t give you hours. They pay is great if you stick it out to full time. People quit multiple times a week and management will even tell them they have to quit so they don’t fire them. Sales goals are so unrealistic because no one ever comes in the store. They will give you the days you need off usually however. Great benifits and discounts. But management will put you down and you will never be doing well enough.
bad,It was a very competitive job atmosphere. We had daily sales goals that we had to hit. If our daily sales goals weren't hit by a certain time period we would receive a decrease in our hourly pay and wouldn't be promoted to another department.
bad,"Haven’t been there long but every employee is treated differently. Some employees can take longer breaks than others for example. If you’re on leave for pregnancy, you HAVE to come back to work within a months time."
bad,"While at this store, I was never given an opportunity to grow due to pressure. If anyone had a good month on sales, that was the new bar, and keeping their job was the prize. The performance expectations over time do not encourage great salespeople to do their best every month, but the exact opposite. And the staff in the dock and security are all but forgotten about by the head managers unless they need something immediately. Not a good working environment."
bad,"A day working at Dillard's is almost unpredictable. Since department stores, however, are not as prevalent as they once were, business is typically very slow. Some days are much slower than others.  Associates are expected to meet they daily sales goals as well as convince customers to open up a Dillard's credit card, keep their area straight, and engage with all customers. Although this is not difficult to do, it is hard to meet these expectations when there are not many, if any, customers shopping in your area."
bad,"Not the worst job I've ever had. Some perks of working there: decent pay for a department store, good employee discount-25% off plus additional discount days, closed on major holidays. If you do have to work on other holidays, management usually brings in lunch. Depending on which area you work in determines your annual review and numbers requirements. Dillard's does NOT advertise so they expect their employees to be telemarketers. It's pretty difficult to meet your SPH goals in Abq. You establish a clientale and are required to basically harass those same customers every month for gift with purchase or some other lame event they put on to draw people in. Slow foot traffic. No one wants to come into an uppity dusty old store.  Most of the managers are uneducated and lack basic managerial skills. Your direct supervisor (like most places) is going to determine whether you can stand your job or debate clocking out for lunch and never coming back. Unethical practices such as: phasing out pregnant employees, claiming they'll work with student's schedules and then not after you've already registered for classes, pitting employees against one another for sales. Also, Dillard's does NOT have an HR department. Outdated store and outdated business practices."
bad,Retail store so you put up with a bunch of stuff from customers. You are always cleaning up after them and I really did not like the job. Retail is not made for me.
bad,"Relaxed job not too busy restaurant side, banquets is where the real work and money is made. What doesn't make sense at the end of each night there is no closing manager. All managers come in early and none stay till close. Only when they started firing people did the kitchen manager have to stay. Very lazy. When a manger contradicts themselves, and is repeating so you lose much respect for them."
bad,Sales quota was unreasonable due to the location of the store. The department lead was a very kind and understanding manager and would assist a sale if needed.
bad,I worked at the Quail Springs location in the cosmetic department and it was very cut throat. The cosmetic ASM always picked on minorities and has no leadership skills. I was a faithful worker for Dillard’s for years and left with a bad taste in my mouth. The goals are unrealistic and hopefully Dillard’s will suffer the same fate as Macy’s and Sears and go out of business.
bad,"I learned quickly that I didn't like retail, it was basically cleaning up after grown people. Besides that I went to three different interviews and the job sounded very promising and they made it seem ver desirable but in reality the sales quotas are ridiculous and don't make any sense. How were three sales associates supposed to each sell $600 worth of clothes on a Tuesday night in 5 hours. You were punished and made to feel incompetent if you didn't meet the high quotas, co-workers would fight over customers just to try and meet their quotas to keep their jobs, and if you missed your quota you had to make up for it the next day, if you did meet your quota and exceeded it, it didn't matter or get any recognition.  They want you to buy a dillards credit card and once I saw my own manager go a buy a bunch of items with her own money to try and meet our departments quota so she wouldn't get in trouble for it."
bad,"They will lie to get you to work there, I was told I would be full time ended up not getting full time and was told I had to keep reaching a higher goal to get full time"
bad,This job honestly didn't teach me anything i didn't already know. Mangement was biest of promotion because i was pretty young when i was hired which really turned me off from working for the whole company.
bad,I was let go when they found out I was pregnant. Was talked to a few times about sales.  Management was okay...was told to sale from other departments.
bad,"Management is on your back everyday to make unrealistic numbers and open store charge accounts with little incentive for customer."
bad,Be prepared to receive only one weekend off per month and even once you accrue vacation time you are discouraged to take anything longer than 4 days and you also  risk losing that time if not used before the new year also stealing is a huge issue and the company is to cheap to implement any real security which I believe is a huge risk to the employees safety since they encourage you to implement good customer service as a tactic to prevent theft but in my experience when people are being harassed the react erratically and  violently and the impossible sales goals breed a hostel work environment so may the odds be ever in your favor happy hunger games!
bad,I enjoyed that position that I was in at Dillard's.  I am just not happy doing retail any longer and working weekends.  My health and mental status needs a regular work week with weekends off.
bad,"I was hired with about 80 other people to help handle the Christmas rush; the rush turned out to be more of a trickle."
bad,"A typical day at work is coming in to find your department is a mess and it takes like an hour to clean up. Once you have finally clean up, you then look at your numbers to find out that you are under your quota and or your quota for the day is very large. I haven't learned anything from the job, all I have learned is that the floor has way too many associates an no business. The management does not help when it comes to talk about what I can do to improve my sales goals. The hardest part of the jobs is keeping up with sales goals, if not, you will get fired. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can talk to other associates without having to fear that they will take your sales."
bad,company bought the store with little intention to continue in the long run.
bad,a great starter place for those seeking employment. pay is not the greatest but there is potential to make lots of money if you work and LWAYS PUT YOUR BEST FOOT FORWARD
bad,"Great customers at Dillard's, only wish managers could be as positive. Very competitive in sales per hour whereas employees are not only responsible for maintaining a sales goal but still responsible for all other duties on the retail floor."
bad,"Management was changed twice during my time of employment."
bad,Your work day start at 4 AM Wednesday through Saturday. You do get 3 days off weekly which is great. You have to make a certain percent to make a descent check. Standing all day on feet even if work is very slow. They are not always honest or flexible.
bad,"Overall, I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they genuinely need one. There should not be a work environment where you wonder whether your job is safe everyday."
bad,Working here is kind of like working in in a pit. The people ranged from nice and helpful to selfish and willing to sabotage others to make their numbers. Hours sucked and at times they'd only give you 2 hours for a shift.
bad,"The work place is very cut throat. "
bad,It wa stressful but it was a great paying job around some great people .To many things going at once in there and the store wasn’t ran proffesional sometime so.
bad,"nothing is every accounted for and management doesn't hold people accountable for there actions. other associates will steal your sales and ""shark"" your customers. you work like a dog with no appreciation."
bad,"A low-end environment using poor display for merchandise. "
bad,I was a part time employee and it was not an enjoyable time. They would cut your pay if you didn’t make your goals to the point people would quit/turn their 2 weeks in because they couldn’t live off their new wages. It is a very stressful environment and employees would fight over sales just to not get their pay cut. Staff is not the first concern of management or higher ranked people.
bad,"It was cut throat for sales in order to keep your job and pay wage. Also, most of the management at that specific location was rude and did not care about its employees."
bad,"I worked in the ladies shoes department which is the only department that is commission based, so it is extremely competitive. Sometimes there would be 5 people scheduled on a monday and all of us are attacking the customer to eagerly make a sale. Returns hurt you and women love to buy a lot then return. It was an easy job, probably the easiest I've had but it was not worth dealing with management or rude customers for the little commission you are lucky enough to make. If you don't get commission you go into deficit and that basically means you have 3 months to get out of it or they lower your pay, if 3 months after that your still in deficit you are given the option to leave on your own terms or will be given a date that you must leave."
bad,"I had a great team to work with but I was frustrated with the unrealistic individual sales goals as there were not enough customers in the store to achieve it. There were other things that needed to be done in my department other than just sales. Receiving and organizing of new inventory, markdowns, cleaning of departments, picking up things after many customers left the area."
bad,At first I loved working here! They taught me basically everything I know about sales and really helped me discover who I was and what I was and am capable of. That is until we got new management! I will just leave it at that!! Stay away from reno in dillards!!!
bad,"I have honestly never heard of a Dillard's where people enjoyed the job, (Of course there are exceptions, a 70 year old retiree who did it for fun liked it, but she didn't need the money so there wasn't much pressure). "
bad,"For a first job its a great place to start, you usually start as a support staff member and from there you can advance to the sales floor. The pay is decent but only if you are in sales do you get a raise.  They cap support staff at a certain amount of money, whether you are there for 1 year or 5 years there's no real advancement or incentive to keep working for them. Most of the clothes they sell cater to there older customers and the buying staff are not informed or study to see what will sell best for each store. To update product to bring in new business.  Some brands the designer takes there time in manufacturing the best products.  They seem to not cater or buy and deliver products according to sales of the geographical area for there merchandise. This is a downfall for them in general. A lot of merchandise only sell when it is marked to 65% off with the extra of 30, 40, or and extra 50%."
bad,Unfortunately there was not many opportunities to advance within the company. The shifts and Salary for employees with My experience  and years of service was not competitive with other retailers.
bad,"They believe in negative reinforcement and nothing else. I have learned much but have been berated and demeaned in the process. The company also tends to have a ""minority quota"" in which they refuse to hire minorities into management positions if there are ""too many"" already working in one location."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the public and my former co-workers, Dillards strives for their employees to sell and if they do not make sales for a ceertain amount of time than they are terminated. I didnt like that about the compnay, but my position didnt entail selling."
bad,"Good job for people who are seeking a good pay for a short period of time to keep moving on. Lack of management skills and unrealistic sales quotas. Company forces employees to be competitive with each other, no team work!"
bad,The work place is quite competitive if you are a sales associate. If you do not reach your sales quota they will fire you. Don't expect leniency when it comes to scheduling. Pretty decent pay. Pray before you work the new years sale.
bad,no work life balance - wanted a lot of hours from you especially during the holidays you wont be able to take any time off management not the most supportive
bad,"I worked there before it became a discount Dillards. The management in my department was horrible.  This mall was dying. There is no foot traffic. Dillard's has a sales per hour type of pay for employees. If you don't meet that quota, they can decrease your pay."
bad,"I enjoyed working in the department that I did and also enjoyed the things that I did. However, the management carried favoritism quite heavily. You do get paid decent to do what you are doing though."
bad,I really liked the people that I worked with they were so nice and caring . I had meet a lot of great people there while working there  it was awesome
bad,"The Hours where often long and scheduling was a conflict , Never had enough associates on the floor, leaving you to do more work under less tiime. Management was not helpful either didnt really listen to concerns."
bad,"When old man Dillard died the company took a turn. over merchandised, antiquated security, and a multitude of problems that investors seem to ignore. Odd."
bad,I like working on the loading dock when there is actually work to do. Work load is very minimal and so are the expectations. I feel this is a reflection of our management and their lack of interest. Management will deliver broken promises just to appease situations. Our ops mgr is very immature and resorts to speaking over others to resolve situations. I also wish she could post our schedules before it actually is time to work so that I can plan my life accordingly. The last time I tried to talk to my dock mgr he looked away from me when I was mid sentence and started talking to someone across the dock. I just walked away and shook my head. Management seems out of touch with what is really going on and seems to me like they don't care. There are a lot of managers at Dillard's and this doesn't define all of their character just most it seems. The loading dock is good for a college student who only wants part time and is passing on to better things because this job leads you nowhere. I would not recommend this job to anyone. The only thing that keeps me here is my co workers and the pay rate. Two jobs gets old and id like to advance with the company but i will probably have to wait until certain management moves along.
bad,No room for advancement. Poor quality of management. Would not recommend anyone to work there. Has to be the worst place I have ever been employed at.
bad,"The management was absolutely terrible. Everyone basically did what they wanted. It was also a really slow mall. Not enough customers came in nor bought items, which made it extremely difficult to meet our quota."
bad,"The culture of Dillards is very poor. If my store manager were to be in a leadership class of mine, I would have to fail her. She instills the cutthroat culture"
bad,"A typical day at a makeup counter are filled with helping customers obtain product knowledge to purchase correct products for their individual needs, teaching of correct product application of products,sale add ons, and drama,drama,drama."
bad,"Worked there for a couple of months in college, but couldn't manage it and school work like I thought. It was also during the economic depression so there wasn't a lot of customers, which meant a lot of standing around."
bad,"If your after money, Dillards is the place to be they have great compensation in that regard, However if you like to have weekends and request days off forget it. they block so much time you literately only have 5 months to choose from to take vacations. I would not recommend this job. Your under  constant threat of being fired. If you don't hit your numbers your fired. If your not in dress code your fired. Like i say good pay just not a good company to work for."
bad,"for the most part it's an enjoyable place to work at and  all the sales associates get along and are friendly but the negative part of this job is still having to meet your sales quota per day/shift  worked regardless if the flow of customers is low, management don't seem to care about that one bit, they still somehow expect you to somehow make your sales quota no matter  what,  eventually if this continues over a 6 month period you either get fired on the spot, or they may keep you a bit longer but drop your hourly wage.  Too many sales associates scheduled on same shift at one time means less chances of any associate making their sales quota on that day especially if it's a slow day and very few shoppers that day"
bad,"Sales quotas unrealistic.  Too many employees in a particular commission area where commission couldn't be obtained throughout the year.  Manager had no people skills, management skills, or personal skills."
bad,"I would only recommend working for Dillard's if you are looking for a temporary job. The management is horrible and treats its employees as garbage. They don't work with your schedule, even if you are in school and they bully you to get you to do what they want. It's easy to get promoted simply because there are few people who want to get promoted and people quit all the time. The only thing I enjoyed about working there was the pay and my peers, but even after a while that wasn't worth it."
bad,"Working at Dillard's was good work experience, but management was a joke and extremely unprofessional; which caused them to have an extremely high employee turn over rate. My manager was unfair with schedules, showed favoritism, and wouldn't do an ounce of work other than sit at her desk on her cellphone. It's busy work with a lot of tasks, which I liked. Money was great. They wanted me to move up in the company, but it wasn't worth the stress."
bad,They do not think twice about If you are in school. They do not work well with college kids scheduling and work schedule. The managers take too long with they scheduling and its is so annoying because you are trying to plan your life months in advance and you cant.
bad,"This place is super flexible, and pay well. the only bad thing is favoritism and hours they give you. I barely have 15 hours a week and for that I lost my 25% discount."
bad,"Working for this company started out fun and exciting. You get to dress up nice every shift, and get to really engage with each customer. The pay is very rewarding."
bad,"Worked part time in various departments."
bad,dont plan to retire here. Great for a first job. The first of the year is the worst. dont work in shoes if you dont like a shark tank or horrible customers on sale days.
bad,"Good job, but you have to sell.. and keep up with latest trends.. You have to recruit and make the schedules, and maintain inventory and damages."
bad,very set schedule.  management is unreasonably demanding. If you are a woman must wear heels throughout shift with a five minute break each other (bring extra shoes)
bad,"insane goals, rude management, no traffic at all dead store because they don t advertice. Nothing to do, learning anything"
bad,"The assistant manager  in the international mall, tampa fl. she is very race person, there not professional and disrespect with the employees."
bad,"job consists of customer service and selling as much as you can during the day in order to make your quota for the day, recovering and the end of the day to make sure the store is perfect for opening the next day"
bad,"job is not for someone looking for permanent employment and if you willing to work every weekend out of a month and hours that are not stable this job is for you. Also, you will never make a raise"
bad,"I think its that simple if you enjoy working with customers and making them long term clients you will love this job. I thought the pay was pretty good because Dillards pay you according to your productivity and so its a some what stable place to work financially speaking.The down side is all the evil people that they hire and they dont screen the workers that they hire anymore so the standard has gone down, so the non productive workers stand around and talk bad about other workers, which is sad because it could be a fun place to work. The management has so many favorites which is not based on the employees coming to work and doing their job. The employees that dont bother coming to work are the management favorites and when you the worker speak out about it your listed as a trouble maker.I would recommend this company for short term or if you are good at bull crapping your way through life you will be able to advance in the company."
bad,"in comparison to other retail companies, Dillards pays employees well. However, the amount of stress, lack of training, and lack of compassion for employees is not at all worth the pay."
bad,"The staff care more about their friends than they do their employees. The starting out pay is great, but it is not easy to keep up with the demands of the company."
bad,The people you meet are from all parts of life  some of them are very fun to work with and other you have to learn there ways something is always going go to make you laught
bad,"All your hard work is worth nothing.  In order to be paid, you have a quota to attain. Dillard's accepts all return items, and that can leave in the negative. Customer's are able to return used and beat up items  and hit is subtracted from your quota and commission."
bad,"Lots of competition on the sales floor due to high, unrealistic sales quota."
bad,Management are on your side to get promoted but the numbers are hard to successfully achieve. Very stressful environment with a negative atmosphere. You are in charge of going out to get your business to make your numbers daily.
bad,"Since this was a part-time position for me, I had no expectations.  There was a lot of pressure on the employees to meet their quota and if the quota wasn't met during the evaluation period, they would deduct $1.00 per hour from their salary."
bad,My co-workers were awesome and probably the only thing keeping me sane. The benefits were okay for the place it was but nothing amazing. I loved my clients in the salon. My manager was the most vindictive and completely horrible person every. I pray for the other ladies and gentlemen that work there. Would not recommend anyone work in the salon. Wasn't busy enough in the store to make commission most weeks. Not enough walk-ins.
bad,it was on OK environment but we were schedule on top of each other so it made it complicated for us to make our goals and it was not a busy store for four people to be in one area especially the department i worked in...The general manage did not know how to talk to her employees in a manageable way.
bad,"I worked for Dillard's just under a year. I did not like working here. Trying to maintain a sales quota and the stress of others taking sales are the main reasons. When I asked for help, it came too late and I was let go because of my sales performance."
bad,it was okay good paying job. manager really didnt care about their employees. no recruiting from with in the company. High turn over rate because the manager ran people away and not good leadership skills
bad,it is a decent place to work for someone who does not have many educational background. Not for someone with aspiration or rapid advancement desire. Not too much income potential
bad,"must meet departmental goals monthly"
bad,Not the best place to work if you are in retail. The sales expectations seem to intentionally set employees up for failure and workplace gossip is a common occurence.
bad,"not job security.  You are threatened to lose your job on a quarterly bases.  No customers, sales, and lack of advertisement to get clients in store."
bad,There were very few things that I enjoyed about working here. The management made it clear that we were disposable and could easily be replaced. I learned that there are always goals that people have to make and if you are not willing to make it happen there will be someone who is willing to do it for you. Co-workers were amazing people they were very easy to get along with and very outgoing people. The hardest part of the job was how management was not willing to work with employees. I loved the fact that I got a chance to learn about every product not only in the store but about every product similar on the market.
bad,Powered up register.  Did till count. Tidied assigned area.  Helped customers choice clothes that fit and looked good on them. The sales quota was unreasonable and standing in dress shoes all day was the worst about working for Dillard's.  Coworkers were the best.
bad,"I've worked for several retailers and can honestly say that while Dillard's claims to be a higher end fashion retailer there upper managements mentality is to push sale merchandise and make the stores look like its a garage sale. The only good thing about it is the compensation you receive, they pay associates extremely well and even management pay isn't horrible. You will receive no meaningful training and it is usually a sink or swim mentality."
bad,"My experience working at Dillard's was miserable. I was able to develop my sales skills, but almost any retail environment can provide that. The management was the worst. Never encouraging, always belittling. There were a few who were visible and respectful but for the most part their management style was to be as rude and tacky as possible. They're the hard part of the job. The sales floor is competitive, given the sales quota and the usual lack of customers. Definitely brings out the worst of some people, but where respect is given it's reciprocated, mostly. The best part of the job is the systematic raises. No matter how awful the management is, you're guaranteed a raise if you meet what's required of you (every 6 months-year)."
bad,"Difficult environment to work in, hardly any training for new associates and managers, associates are lazy,Very few great managers, Fake when Owners would visit store, Old computer systems outdated and computer guns outdated needs to upgrade store operations. No company floor sets/Grids, Non togetherness as far as work relations. High turnover rate."
bad,"As a part-time, non-permanent option while in school, Dillard's is OK depending on which one it is, what department they put you in, and who your management is. The one I worked at was not my favorite by any means. The store manager constantly tried to make me take less classes in order to work full-time, but my department manager was really understanding about my schooling needing to come first."
bad,"After working for Dillards over 2 years, The managemnet and employee turn-over was ridiculous. The new mangement that was often replaced were trained to get rid of new and old employees. They were not willing to help people to keep jobs. Dillards is a company that goes by a quota every three months and if you dont make goal you will be fired. I have one question due to the company people are looking for the best deal so you can  get people to buy at regular price or even by at all. Why should you punised and out of a job if you can make quota. But the employees are great people and a pleasure to work with. Most Departments are very helpful but the employees at time were hard to work with because of the  QUOTA."
bad,Not a busy store which makes it hard to achieve the quotas/goals they set for you. Not making them could result in loss of your job. A busier store I'm sure wouldn't be so bad. Goals should be set according to store volume in my opinion.
bad,Good to start and learn sales skills. Quota system is tricky and you have to sell a lot to break even or make any comission
bad,"Its ok. It;s just like a big adult high school with terrible managers. There are some nice people there but its always dramatized . All they care about is numbers,numbers,numbers, and credit apps. "
bad,"Leadership is very important to me, which I developed after a position in leadership myself at a previous department store. I have found that my floor manager does nothing to be apart of the team that she tries to motivate daily. My store manager as well as assistant store manager expect not to be approached on the floor about anything, we are told to talk to our floor manager first, if that doesn't work out, make an appointment with the store managers assistant. After making an appointment and it not be acknowledged, we are expected to email them; which I have found still to be unreliable. Not one manager I have come across at the store has been consistent. I however like that I am at free fall in my department, being a department supervisor previously I can make decisions about my area and the arrangement of the floor as I please. I have sharpened my sales skills being at this department store and have learned what to and what not to do as a member of leadership, given the opportunity in the future."
bad,a typical day would be putting up stock waiting on customers. I did learn how to sell and fit suits as well as more about furniture. Management ranged from great to are you kidding me. Some co-workers were considerate of other workers but it was very dog eat dog. After awhile the hardest part of the job was clocking in.The place really got to be a drag. The most enjoyable part was talking to the ones I made friends with.
bad,"Fun place of fashion"
bad,"Not a Place Where You Can Advance In The Company. Rules and regulations are not followed by Policy. Dillards cut your salary if you are not making your sales per hour qoals, don't consider how bad the economy is. They subtract from your sales per hour if you sell outside your work center, even through that is apart of our job to 5 star selling."
bad,"i learned how a major department store keeps cost down and repairs thing on a low budget, keeping labor cost to a minamum and exacting the most out of its personell,"
bad,"This job looks good on the outside.  They do pay alright, but for the amount of BS you have to deal with...it's not worth it. Management plays favorites.  They expect you to get customers to sign up for credit cards, but if you have to lie to customers to get them to sign up that's ok with management as long as they sign up.  People steal sales and cheat you left and right, but management doesn't care as long as the person stealing sales is making their numbers"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of standing all day, no breaks. You were constantly be pushed to hassle customers to open credit cards. Management wasn't mean but they also didn't show appreciation towards employees. The hardest part of the job was the standing for 8 hours straight. The most enjoyable was getting to know co-workers."
bad,"I'm a new hire with Dillard's and I consider this to be the job that I need to bring in money till something else comes along. First and foremost they suck at training, they throw you on the floor and its either swim or sink, and their are a lot of employee polices told to you rather than store polices, believe me I'm not stupid to fall for the employee polices. I've only seen my department manager in my department once and that was only because there was a promotion in the store and she was standing there passing out flyers. If you want cat fights and insults thrown your way, this is the place for you, you have to have thick skin, which I do so it doesn't go deep. Sales quota's as others have said are higher than the volume of customers, yet your still expected to do it or you get a reduction in pay or fired. As I said earlier in this comment, this job is just the job till something else comes along they is not retail, or commission."
bad,"Dillards management doesn't seem to care about their employees, in fact most employees know within a week that it won't be a long term job."
bad,"I've been at Dillard's for three years now. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time you put in with little to no compensation. Management can be great or not so great depending on where you're at. I've had great store managers, and I've also had managers that lack experience and professionalism. They tend to focus on managers and associates that they want to help grow, IF you're to their liking. It seems that if you're not in the click, then you are stuck where you're at, no matter how much experience you have or how qualified you are. Though Dillard's is a great atmosphere with energetic coworkers, sometimes it takes more than that to make your job worth while."
bad,I signed  in and went to my station If we had new products I Would have to put it on the wood hangers and set  up the new products as for produccall. The hardest/best part is being on sales per hour and not knowing when you will be getting a pay cut of raise
bad,Promises were always made about my future in the company but absolutely no follow thru. Other associates are extremely caddy and competitive with sales and managers never address the issues at hand.
bad,"Dillards' was a very exciting company to work for. It was always some type of event going on rather it was a sell or fashion show. "
bad,"This store is considered a high end department store with merchandise a lot of stores don.t provide, therefore a lot of time is spent on customer service. Time was  spent  calling customers to invite  them in. What I learn is  that if people have money you don't have to call them to come in and spend it.. Management was  interested in pleasing upper management. Co-workers were  superb ,willing to give a helping hand. The hardest part of the job was  the SPH(Sales Per Hour)We were given a sales goal each day and we were  also responsible for all returns under our sales  number so if our sales goal is $1,500.00 and we sell $1,600.00 and our returns were $800. the difference was tacked on the next days sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is servicing the customers. I put everything negative behind me and rely on attitude, character and countenance."
bad,I have worked in retail for 7 years. Dillard's has been the hardest job thus far. Everyday is like you are entering a shark tank
bad,They don't pay their employees good at all.  The benefits are horrible. Wouldn't work for them again.
bad,"To service customers  to best of my abilities . i've learned how to do inventory and audit. working as a team,  part of the job trying to find the perfect item customer needs. lunch time and home."
bad,It was a typical job in Dillards not many responsibilities as a sales associate but many hours put into a shift sometimes 10-12 hours a day is too many for entry level sales associates. Management had empty promises.
bad,"Has very hardworking co-workers."
bad,"Co-workers make it fun, Helping customers whether it be a comforter  or a pair of shoes."
bad,This organization had strict rules with hard to reach sales goals.  Most of the staff were short term as many people just worked there while they were in school.  
bad,"I work two jobs.  One is the store cashier, balancing the previous day's cash intake and preparing the deposits and necessary paperwork needed for audit purposes.  I also work at the customer service counter, answering a multiple line telephone, transferring calls, paging managers, assisting customers as well as associates and managers.  I process internet orders and prepare orders for shipping.  I truly enjoy the work but the managers are immature and are unwilling to enforce the rules.  It is a ""do as I say, not as I do"" environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the work, the customers and many of my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the associates who treat what I do as beneath them, dealing with managers who don't know how to do their job and who expect me to enforce rules that they don't enforce."
bad,I really enjoyed the work i did and the managers and supervisors did there ability.I just got more hands on experience working with the customers.We did work long hours and very short breaks.
bad,"For having the title of sales associate Dillard's holds you to much higher expectations. Daily personal sales goals, recruiting for events. The hardest part of the job is managing the different goals assessed to you on a weekly basis, the best part of the job is getting to play with makeup and make your clients feel beautiful inside and out"
bad,opening registers and clozing very damanding I came with knowledge and a lot of experience to dillards In orders to suceed you had to be jack of all trades and master of none. to keep upwith the quota that you were given and decorating your whole dezigner area calling clients and setting up the entire floor with their new merchandize and trying to sell the merchandise and promoting it dint leave to much room for acompliszing your goal for the day and other employs selling your beautiful merchandiz that you just displayed on the entire sportswear area.Very difficult to be satisfied as an employee with some kind of future you give you heart and soul and yet you get penolized with pay cut if you dint keep up with your sales.my expertize dint help because I felt that in order to suceed in dillards ther had to be 3 of you in one soul fighting with the rest of the so called team there is no team if you are strugling to suceed on you own area fighting with different tasks and trying to keep your head above water to survive as a employee to much there is a turnover because when you have a lot of retail experience you know in you heart thats using an eplooyee and really not helping him to suceed or even grow with the company.the only good thing is I manage to meet some old friends and spend money when i shoped and was given the employee discount
bad,"You either make your sales goals or your cut, plain and simple"
bad,So far Dillards has been the worst place I have worked. They did not work with my school schedule at all. I was almost fired because I refused to come into work on the days I had school because I had homework and studying to do. They wanted me to work 14 days in a row because the two other ladies that worked in the morning had requested vacation back to back.
bad,The turnover rate of management and personnel is too high.
bad,I sold kid's shoes and accessories. I left because it was too hard to travel so far. A few months later Dillards closed the store.
bad,The staff was great but the HR was hartless and only cared about numbers. I truly think that the location I was at was lacking in upper Managment skills.
bad,This is a company that is run by a bunch of kids. Need I say more...
bad,I just have to say that I personally would not recommend this company to people looking for a permanent position.
bad,"Worked as a sales associate, and we assisted customer with any purchase as well as made suggestions on purchase."
bad,"I really enjoyed working here for the most part, but the company itself does not really care about you. Management only cares about how much money you bring in for the company, and if you don't bring in enough for the month - usually - then you get fired. The customers, for the most part, were very nice, with the exception of some thinking they need to be catered to. The workplace atmosphere was very competitive and a little toxic to be totally transparent. However, I really enjoyed the company of my coworkers and they made working here enjoyable."
bad,"Constant sales pressure. You will be promised training but will receive none. Sales pressure starts day 1. Very little foot traffic at this store in a dead mall. I spent a lot of time talking to fellow associates and “looking” busy....as the store is often very empty. You will always be watched by management. Store manager is never happy. Horrible attitude. When Dillard’s VP’s come visit you will be lectured and instructed on what to say and how to behave. This store is dysfunctional. Nice coworkers though.  They will frequently harass you about sales, knowing full and well the store is empty of shoppers. They have to.   If no one is in the store you will be expected to call customers and ask them to come in."
bad,I dont want to give a statement . I wish not to speak on the company. I am glad that i had a chance to work at the company. i got some excellent experience working there
bad,While Dillards can be a great job for new employees as the time progresses there is always new responsibilities with no new money to come with. Bad communication between employees and higher ups and store manger has power to do whatever whenever without taking anyone into consideration
bad,They Don't understand how to advertise and how to spend their money wiser aswell as making the job more pleasentable to the people coming in the work force they make you work hard by completing all the task that other places hire people to do hence the pay being pretty good One thing i will say was great was WEEKLY PAY so no need to stress about money and clothes were greatly priced
bad,"Well at first the job was great at first. After a while it kinda sucked because I was always left out of the loop like I didn't ever know when big events where or sale days I usually found out the same day. I felt like I was being ignored for the most part and on my last day none of the managers said anything to me. I was happy to leave. T"
bad,The company told me i would go full time after 90 days and i was there for 9 months and never went full time. The employees are good people the management was in quite a mix-up when i was there but it was an alright experience overall.
bad,"I’n training the job sounded amazing so did the company , but that quickly turned out to be a lie. The management is so unprofessional and rude . They are also unorganized, the managers barley even know their areas"
bad,Dillards warehouse is not an awful job but the experiences im having now with Dillards along with many others is a great dtrain on my outside life i feel like i just am over worked and under paid!
bad,The managers have unrealistic expectations for the sales. There's one or two employees who they love who get away with everything. A lot of turnover and getting yelled at. Management is out of touch with the floor.
bad,"Working as a sales associate definitely provides hard won benefits. The experience in customer service is useful for a huge range of jobs down the line. And despite it's well earned bad reputation there can be a lot of joy in helping customers. The struggle with Dillard's is the sales quota. You must meet your quota in order to retain any benefits and even employment. Which in theory is fine. But the quota is unrealistically high even before you take into account needing to spend your time organizing the stock room, doing markdowns, maintaining the sales floor, and everything else your job requires. It's incredibly demoralizing to feel so pressured to be required to bully customers into spending as much money as possible. Which they then return which still counts against you. It's miserable."
bad,"Starting salary is higher than normal places for entry level jobs. However, even when you are hired part time, you will be asked to work five days a week. Management does not really care about anything besides making their goals. In addition, you will not be making your own schedules and there will be minimal consideration for your personal appointments even if you give management multiple notices ahead of time."
bad,"The sales quota is hard to maintain especially at that location. Also to many customers take advantage of the products. They would buy the shoes for an event and then return them. They would looked woren but anytime you tell them no, the managers take them anyways just to not have to deal with them arguing. Which would hurt our quota and put us more in deficit. Poor scheduling as well. They would put 3 sale associates on a slow day ranking up deficit on your account. If you’re in school I wouldn’t recommend this job they don’t work well your schedule. Other than that relatively easy work. You fix the back stock room, clean the floor and make sure the labels under the shoes are able to scan. The pay is decent for the work you do but just can’t maintain the quota you are dealt with daily. If you work there think of it as a landing pad till you find something else"
bad,"Did not have a manager that was active, she was never in communication with her team.  I had to go above her to get anything done.  The scheduling of hours was done with no consideration for the employee, some times only 1 day off per week, other times 2 days off but not together.  It was as if never had rest, only work."
bad,"At Dillard's we have a sales per hour goal and you have to maintain your goal to have the job there. in meridian, it is not upscale like dillard's is so over time the company has slowed down especially in the cosmetics department, so we have to work really hard to maintain our goals and pay. it is very easy to get fired so i am blessed to have been there as long as i have. i really do love what i do, but sometimes job security is a worry for me."
bad,"greeting customers, operating the cash register. helping customers with questions. cleaning fitting rooms and doing display mannequins.learned sales quota."
bad,Dillard's is a typical job for a high school student. the management is one of a kind. the enjoyable part is meeting new people. also it is a good high school job.
bad,I worked in the women's shoes department it was commission based. Very cut throat people competing against each other. No team work. Helped customers with shoe sales and kept stock area clean.
bad,learned how to manage staff like when i was a platoon sgt army spec 4       wk day hard   good  hardest  job computer work  friendly comfortable salary
bad,Everything about that job would have been perfect if it weren't for the store manager. Working on shipments while a truck came in to display new products there was always plenty to do and ways to stay busy and focused. Markdowns were being be placed daily. Sale and push items were a must.
bad,"Dillards is tough for the sales reps, it is a nice store but employees can actually get a pay decrease if they do not keep up on their sales. This leads to a cut throat environment."
bad,"Dillards is a nice place to work if you're in school, they work well with your school schedule but your weekends are over because you work every weekend. It's very competitive and you have to keep up your sells if you want to keep your pay. The struggle for college students is that you won't have holidays to go home. Overall it is a decent job and pretty chill."
bad,No opportunity for training or advancement. Felt treated in a disrespectful manner. Didn't feel valued or appreciated for efforts. No guidelines or structure.
bad,"At first I enjoyed my job and even came in on days off.I relocated and liked it even more.After a second relocation I was convinced this was the job for me.Once the economy took a dump in 2008-09 the company went to 💩.Managers were lousy,no more incentives and quality of salespeople went down big time.What Once was a joyful place and beautiful dept store now ended up turning into a high priced Tj Maxx.It became hard to go to work due to the management inability to run a nice dept store.Needless to say I would rather spend a night in jail rather than clock in and work in that horrible environment."
bad,"I enjoyed working with customers and helping them find the items they were looking for.  Helpful and friendly employees.  Room for advancement, if interested."
bad,not a friendly work place vey cutthroat and management not very friendly are not responsive to employees Management can be very disrespectful at times not looking at big picture
bad,"It was a stressful job,  having somebody constantly  on your shoulders, you have to process all merchandise in a time frame.. they expect to much from the dock with not enough pay.. The dock is the bottom of the barrel for dillards."
bad,"You can move on up at Dillard's through management, but all the work load your given, it almost doesn't seem worth it.  Overall an associate is alright with less responsibilities.  I would recommend another retail store."
bad,Sales goals ALWAYS unrealistic! Co-workers always stealing your sales! Management specifically at Altamonte Mall in Fl is Absolutely HORRIBLE. Pay is very decent! Consistent hours!
bad,be careful working here the high sales goals makes the work environment very stressful for both employees and managers. they don't care how good a worker you are if your sales aren't good enough they fire you.
bad,"Not the best company to work for. The management was not the best, was not a company to stay with.  I dont have anything else to say. They try to be fun to attract people."
bad,"For the most part dillards was and is an average workplace where you always have something to do, the pay rate is decent and the staff is very nice excluding the few that make themselves evident within the first couple weeks. The greatest issue is the training gap. by which I mean the overwhelming lack there of, a gap that can be found in the managment as well. This results in  a genneral breakbown in comunication when an employee tries to make any iquiry regarding policies, advancement, or performance."
bad,"Some locations are fun and enjoyable.It depends upon the leadership in each store. Different districts are enjoyable to work in with advancement and recognition. The Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma region is challenging with little to no job secuirty in recent months under new VP. "
bad,All they talked about was numbers in the morning. It is not inspiring and everyone seemed depressed and stressed to me. The breakroom was gloomy and full of daily quota complaints.
bad,"managers nag and bully, they are rude and unprofessional. "
bad,"A very competitive environment in the Cosmetic Department."
bad,"Must be able to multi task, situations and procedures will change several times daily. The hardest task is over seeing the management and clerical duties with no help. I enjoy the work and co-workers, customer service has become  last priority."
bad,"This Dillard's was in the process of going out of business when I worked there. Instead of telling their employees, they gave us higher quotas to fill."
bad,"On the surface, this workplace seems well cultured, easy going and low stress. "
bad,"Dillard's is all about making numbers. Meaning, you must sell to keep your job. Most employees stay within the company for just 6 months. The employees that have been there for many years are unfair and unpleasant to work with. I do not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"It's decent money, but that's about it. The managers are corrupt and really do not care about their employees well being. It's easy work though."
bad,Excellent company to work for great benefits and decent discount for employees. Must be prompt and on time and provide good customer service.
bad,Management is nearly impossible to locate or communicate with. There's little to no organization within any area of the entire company. No opportunity for advancement unless you start out on the dock. Co-Workers are bitter and over-dramatic. There's a very 'every man for himself' mentality with the way the Sales Performance system is set up and with co-workers. The only real benefit to working at Dillard's is that they start their employee's payrate out at a staggering 11.00/hour. Retail generally doesn't pay that high.
bad,"Just no, Don't do it. Management is just as unprofessional as the employees. Corporate is a mess, Everything about this company is a disaster."
bad,It's a regular retail job. No advances unless you've worked there for several years. Sales goals unrealistic during slow periods. Management is ok. Un-friendly highly competitive co-workers
bad,"Sale, Sale Sale.......... The idea is if you don't meet these extremely high goals you can lose job and your pay is lowered."
bad,Makeovers for walk in customers. Learned different styles of apply makeup and how to do it appropriately. Hardest part was hitting retail sales. Most enjoyable was pleasing people with the makeover and teaching them how to achieve the same look themselves.
bad,Ive worked at Dillards for about 3 years... a typical day would include recruiting customers to your area...pushing sales either in person or over the phone...way to much stress over daily goals that seemed impossible at times due to no customers.
bad,"You may end up working 6 days and 50 plus hours a week from Nov-Feb. Typical day is selling, maybe some stock work. You work on an SPH, so your pay is decided on how much you can sell. If you do not hit your SPH, you will go into deficit until you pay back the company what you owe them. Co-workers can be sharky, especially in Womens Shoes. Hardest part of the job are the hours, especially if you have a family. Best part is the $2,000-$4,000 commission checks I would receive while in shoes in December."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of customer service and trying to sell credit cards.  You do mark downs, put out stock where they belong, and change out displays.  I learned how to handle a cash register easily, and about fashion products.  Management is just okay (and rotates often), but they don't really take consideration employees words on things.  The job comes with a  sales per hour that you have to maintain, and that's what your review is based on, how many sales you bring in.  It makes the job less secure, though, so its better as an in-between job rather than a long term career.  (Plus, if you're looking to advance quickly, don't).  To make it for a long time, you gotta be a really aggressive sales go-getter and interactive people person.  However, it comes with decent benefits (whichever ones you choose to sign up for), a good pay, and hour long breaks."
bad,"You will be in competition with your co workers. The sales floor can get uncomfortable. And they lower hourly pay if SPH isn't met. "
bad,"The customers and employees were great to work with, a good team effort.  The manager wanted all of the employees to succeed."
bad,"In my time at Dillard's I was one of the top salesmen at the store. That being said everyone was prone to have a day where they did not sell well, either foot traffic was low or what have you. That did not stop management from reminding you that reviews were coming up and that if you do not sell they will fire you. The company did not value its employees and often felt it appropriate to threaten job security, whenever they felt you may be ""under preforming."""
bad,Perfect for a high school job as they only hire for part time usually averaging 15 to 20 hours a week if you're lucky. Even if the department sales drop and your sales aren't where they want them to be it they will fire you.
bad,I felt trapped in a dead end job. There was little room for growth within the company. It was management against the associates.
bad,This was a learning experience. Working for Dillard's can be uncomfortable because the management creates a dog-eat-dog world for the employees in order to keep their job. Not many employees seem happy when they are at work.
bad,Great place for entry level pay...Over all from my experience it's all in who you know to climb the ladder but beware when you get there could be a bumpy ride...Unrealistic expectations usually set you up to fail and you will be held accountable not the upper management...I for example was over worked and under paid...
bad,Dillard's wants you to focus on nothing the the numbers. It doesn't matter how you get them as long as your on top. If you don't then the harassment starts. As a manager I fought to keep good employees that were let go because they were not making their numbers.
bad,"Management needs serious improvement, poor leadership skills from the store manager on down.  No job security from one day to the next."
bad,Helped customers with there purchase and gave advise about cosmetics.
bad,Taking care of customers all day. Responsible for achieving personal goal.
bad,"Difficult to advance, workers taken advantage of and not compensated well for all the work done"
bad,"They allow associates to sell in any department. Even though they ""do not"" promote sharking they will not reprimand anyone caught doing it. They only care about the numbers. You could be the best employee, in terms of tasks, but if you're a low seller you won't last long."
bad,"Great Pay "
bad,There is nothing truly negative nor positive I can say regarding this company. They need to revise and educate employees on their policies and stay consistent with request from employees.
bad,"Probably the worst company I've ever worked for, no room for growth, and always feeling inadequate"
bad,Good Sales Experience. Meet people frequently. The management are organized and friendly.
bad,"""selling"" can get very hostile between workers. Great pay and incentives."
bad,"You worked over 40 hours a week, every week and there was no overtime pay. Upper management always expected you to be early and not leave until everything was buttoned up in your department. Often hours were 9am - 7:30pm. Lunches were a bright spot as you could usually sneak an extra few minutes without anyone checking on you. Management was poor and didn't really support the growth you desired for your department. It was more about sales and only sales, everything is the same but sell more."
bad,"Assist customers with sales."
bad,"A typical day at work was, exciting and enjoyable while working with customers; however, it was also quite stressful and unfair when it came to meeting quotas that couldn't basically be met. "
bad,"Dillard's is a complete set up! The company preys on college/unemployed individuals who are toughing it out in a slow economy. The starting pay is very nice but within 90 days you will more than likely see a pay cut because of Dillard's ridiculous SPH model that ask employees to sale X amount of dollars per hour. The task seems simple but when you have x amount of employees on the floor and ZERO customers you have yourself a problem. You're often over worked and left doing busy work, management can be helpful but be careful because they'll likely leave you hanging when their butt is on fire. "
bad,"Daily I count large sums of money in a room called The Money Room which we keep our secured vault.  I am responsible to balance and maintain all cash from previous day sales and for all cash registers for the following day.  I do cash deposits, give change to employees for their cash registers, answer phones, file daily, and communicate with a corporate auditor to ensure everything is balanced daily."
bad,"Great co workers, I love dealing with clients and helping stylist's with their books and overall issues"
bad,"The pay is a little above average, but if you do not sell you will loose your job. They hardly run sales. You cannot sale if the customer is not in the store."
bad,there were many days that were busy and many that were slow. Over all the place was in much needed help of improvment.
bad,"A typical day at work was either very busy and fast paced, or very slow and not many customers. Management changed frequently due to the hiring and firing of so many, associates were very competitive but focused more on each other's personal lives than the task at hand while at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to dress mannequins and pretty much arrange your department to your discretion with little or no guidelines. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the small minded individuals who lived in that town and weren't very fond of minorities unfortunately. I learned a lot about product display and effective selling techniques in order to accomplish five star selling all throughout the store."
bad,Very challenging to sell to customers. Not too much pressure. Very Quiet.
bad,The workplace was over all ok. Although management didnt communicate and noone which new what they were doing
bad,"Pretty laid back job. Unattainable sales goals in specific areas, particularly the ones they start you off in. Expect to have this job 6-9 months."
bad,"Working at Dillard's you work with many different cultures. I loved being able to sell a lovely fragrance to the customer and know that they loved it. I sent out mail orders, assisted the customer and worked with Management. We all worked as a team for the good of the client. Management was number oriented and wanted us to exceed our goals. Sometimes this was very hard to do. I always did my best. You work long hours and were on your feet for six hours at a time. The customers were the best part of this experience."
bad,"Gained a lot of experience working with many different people, learned to deal with various types of customers. Essentially if you can work there you can deal with any customers anywhere else for the rest of your professional career. However the management and the general quality of the company will make you tear your hair out on a consistent daily basis."
bad,Job was pretty fun. Management never recognized good things done. They expect you to pull through even if there is absolutely no traffic walking through the doors and are always quick to punish those who can't pull through.
bad,"Very poor adherence to company mission, double standards, conflicting instructions and expectations, poor communication. The store manager has never worked retail but goes around telling career retail workers how to do their jobs just to feel useful."
bad,"Management did not meet to my level of efficiency Im use to, how unprofessional they treat their associates in certain situations. Was sometimes a stressful and almost toxic work area."
bad,"the managers do not care about your schedules, they accuse people of stealing for no reason and they push people a lot to make sales.They make employees fight for sales just to get stuff out of their stores."
bad,"You are expected to develop relationships with customers. However, that is not realistic when you may be the only person covering multiple areas.  Especially if you are working evenings when staff is cut. This was a concern because of issues with shoplifters. They would hit when they knew there were fewer people covering departments."
bad,"The discount is great and some people are amazing but overall at my location management does not recognize the good only gets very upset about the bad, work culture is very high school and catty with a high turnover rate."
bad,Its a nice job to have but you have to be serious about sales and making your sales goals because management will be on top of you. Management will work with you to help better develop your sales skills.
bad,"Very stressful, fast paced to work.Long hours due to low staffing. Going to management did not help stressful  work environment with certain coworkers."
bad,I didn't like the job. The management was poor and they didn't give me enough hours.. the store function was poor i feel like the way we ran the store in general could have been better.
bad,"I work in the backroom of Westfield Countryside Dillard’s. I thought that I would really enjoy working there. But I was very wrong, I get treated very differently compared to the others on my team. I literally feel like I’m not welcomed there and that I am not part of the team. I work very hard at any job that my manager assigns to me and do great job at it. But yet, he’s very rude and haven’t even fully trained me on everything for that store."
bad,under staff and I do a lot of the work that a business manager should do! I do my job as well as a business managers job without the pay. I enjoy helping people and making them feel good about them selves!  The sale per hour is very unrealistic for the business that do!
bad,Management sucks. From your deparment manager to the Store manager. They want you to preform miracles but don’t want to give you the resources to do so. They pay decently but you can get a pay cut if you don’t meet your daily goals. Which are impossible to meet.
bad,A typical day at work may be dragging or quicker than the speed of light but it all depends on the flow of the day. I learned that sometimes you know more than your typical manager sometimes.
bad,"a typical day at Dillard's is coming in cleaning. Making sure customers are satisfied, And always focusing on earning your customers some rewards. We also try to to push the new merchandise so that customers know whats in style. The hardest part of it all especially in the Juniors dept. is that we have so much clearance that they don't care about the full price items as much. But i do enjoy that i get to know my customers which helps me make there visit even better at Dillard's."
bad,Good pay but the culture is determined solely by the store manager. There is no human resources. Processes and operations are out dated which takes you away from sales and your performance is measured by sales per hour.
bad,Working at Dillard’s was fun. Our department always had a lot of events going on. I was not able to meet my sales goal which at times was very hard because there was a lot of people working in each department.
bad,"I worked at a Dillard's Clearance Center in Asheville, NC. We had huge sales every weekend, and it got very busy. Normally, I like being kept busy at a job, since it helps the time go by faster and makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. However, we only had about half of the staff that we needed to run the store properly. Even with 22 fitting rooms the line would still frequently wrap around the walls of the store, and with only two or three people to operate them it quickly became unmanageable. There was a limit on the number of garments that could be taken in at one time, but there was no limit on the number of items that they could place on hold outside. Customers were allowed to take in their ten garments, come back out and return them to us, then pick out ten more from their holds and go right back in -- even when there was a huge line. All of the clothes had to be sorted and taken back to their respective places. Many of them also had to be color coded. It was almost impossible to keep up on the weekends. Additionally, there wasn't enough staff to put on the floor to keep things nice and neat. The store looked horrible all the time despite our best efforts, and we were blamed for these shortcomings. Combine that with the stress of being a salesperson and having goals for the number of credit card signups each month and you've got a recipe for disaster. Even at $10 per hour, it just wasn't worth it. Maybe it would have been different if they had hired on more people during the eight or nine months I was there."
bad,"corporate is only worried about themselves. I was a dock manager for a year and a half and never received a raise, was only asked to do more work. no bonuses, no incentives..."
bad,Working at Dillard's was good if you're a simple student or young adult looking for a way to make good money but the problem is that of you aren't a god-like sales person then trust me. you aren't gonna make it.
bad,"Most of the management tries to make employees compete against each other for sales. Management does not always give corrective criticism, they sometimes speak to you as if you are below them. Perhaps it is a decent place to work while in college, but I would not recommend being full time nor would I recommend staying there for forever."
bad,dillard's mangers act like they care for you but on care about you if you are a top seller. they make you apply for a credit card from them when you first start working there just to get your discount. they only care about you meeting your numbers and making them money. the bosses are really mean and evil. they do not like if you are in school and act like they can't work around your school schedule and they only give you one saturday a month off. the pay is good but not for all you go through when i left dillards i was excited it felt like i have just been released from prison.
bad,"The managers was not willing to work with my school schedule and my other job schedule. A typical day at work was sometimes slow, the customers was rude sometimes. There was nothing hard about the job."
bad,"With this company it is ""who you know"" not ""what you know"" that will make the difference.  This company does promote from within however  those interested in promotion should also be prepare to relocate."
bad,"Dillards gave me a lot of customer service experience, stock experience, and people skills. There was a lot of immaturity and lack of management throughout the workplace. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"I only worked at Dillard’s for a little over a couple months mainly for the fact that the staffers were very prejudice, racist, sexist and rude to customers. Our staff acted as though they were children fighting for attention in a playground, yes we made money based on commission however half the time none of us would get any customers and the other half would fight over the few we did have. The management was poor and would punish you if your schedule changed but you cannot view your schedule anywhere but in the store so you never really knew when you worked. And if they change your schedule and don’t notify you they will doc your pay extremely or make your starting pay less. Overall a very hard time to keep up with."
bad,Working for Dillard's was okay. They pay you better than most to work in a retail environment but you have to maintain your sph {sales per hour) goal to keep your rate of pay or you will face pay cuts and termination. You are responsible for your sales and the returns fall on you as well. Management at the store I was at was awful. They can be rude and nasty. The nicer people in management are forced out. I wouldn't recommend working there unless you had thick skin and a cut throat personality to maintain your numbers.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend simply for the lack of hours, and the sales associates, and managers treat the dock employees unfairly , and trying to move up in the company seems almost impossible!"
bad,its been years since i worked there and its all different management so i can't say much about how it is now. but its very competitive with making your daily sales.
bad,"As a sales professional working in the junior's department, a typical day of work consists of merchandising, cleaning out dressing rooms and putting clothes away, catering to our clients, and keeping the department tidy while also minding our personal and department goals. There has to be a balance."
bad,"Dillard’s is very competitive and cut-throat, a very stressful place to work. Management is very hard on you to make your sales, and if you don’t or if you are sick too often your job is threatened. Not a stable place to work at all."
bad,My time at Dillard’s was a great learning experience but there was no opprtunity to advance and the management was very unprofessional. The pay was decent for the work that required.
bad,I only worked here for the money that you get weekly. They don't like if you take a day off if your sick and you have to sell a certain amount of products or you'll get fired
bad,They had unrealistic expectations that took away from the customer because the employees were too focused on making their numbers as opposed to giving the customer the best experience possible.
bad,Was very stressed because we had a certain quota we had to sell and it was usually a ridiculous amount. Also we rarely got weekends off which I think is not reasonable.
bad,"Dillard's is a company that pays it's employees well for being a retail position.  They also have some policies which make it a very family friendly company.  For example, they have never opened on Thanksgiving to begin the Black Friday sales before Christmas so that employees can spend more time with family. The sales expectations are unrealistic to reach on a daily basis when you consider there are usually 3-4 other associates in the department trying to get each sale as well.  At the same time there is an unrealistic sales goal, there is also the physical labor needing to be done daily as well.  It is impossible to complete all the tasks given as well as reach your sales goals.  When this does not happen, you are under constant threat of dismissal, pay reduction, or demotion. A particular manager made the job awful by hard pressing for results which could simply not be attained."
bad,"Very slow paced sales environment. Hourly rate based on sales with a potential to take a pay cut or raise each year on your review. Most people cannot move from their pay bracket and spend a fair amount of time stressed over sales worried about losing their jobs. Management, from department up through regional, was very disconnected from the associates. Pay starts out very good for retail sales, great for part time work. Would never consider making a career with this company."
bad,I loved working at Dillards at first. I soon found out that they lie when they say they promote from within and value hard working employees. The only thing they value is your sales and if you don't meet them they will fire you without hesitation.
bad,"Working there was fun for the first 3 year when I work in customer service, but when I move to the floor it was a little scary. because we had high goal to me and they wanted use to push credit. But think about if you already in the whole why should you dig deeper. For a example on a slow day they except you to do $1200 that day when you have 6 associate on the floor and only 5 customer all day. I'm not lying. But I did the best I could with the time I was there."
bad,"The overall job isn't bad, the expectation of the store is harsh. It's slow, all the time, hard to make numbers. Make sure you build a clientel. The people are great."
bad,"Very competitive, and often times unreasonable, sales expectations. Management in the department I worked in was extremely unprofessional and degrading to so many individuals."
bad,"Great pay, horrible company, benefits and management could improve a lot, very stressful everything quota based. If you do not make your goal they cut your pay drastically. Definitely has high turnover rate"
bad,"I enjoyed they pay rate and getting paid weekly, however the management at the Sugar Land location is absolutely horrible. From the store manager to the department managers. They are not helpful, gossip and allow horrible employee friction to exist for the sake of making a sale."
bad,"I worked full time at Dillard's and worked hard within the parameters I was given.  Unfortunately, most of the day I did not have much to do.  Sales were down due to the current state of the economy. "
bad,"fast paced days with may restrictions. I learned how to be more persaonable in my service and excel in my personal business goals. Management is not very consistant. high turn over with management and coworkers. many do not make it throught 6th months. hardest part working in a unhealthy cowork enviroment, due to pay cuts if you are not meeting the the sales goals assigned to you. the pay cut could up to 15 percent. Does not inspire team building from management or coworkers. everyone is just trying to survive and keep their pay. Most enjoyable part, pays much better than most jobs."
bad,"The job depends on customer frequency because of the quota required by Dillards.  This can be difficult most of the times.  Associates are treated as numbers most times.  There is a need to produce, but don't get  rid of good people. Help associates to grow and develop and improve the training."
bad,the compensation is great however work place is very hostile and there is too much pressure to sell high ticket items. management is rude and will not work with your schedule.
bad,"It was hard to get sales because there were not enough customers unless it was holiday season."
bad,"Dillards is a respectable store, although being employed with this company is very different. Lack of management and structure."
bad,Dillard's has many great benefits; The Managers are really nice and try to work with your personal life. The pay is also very nice. Plus the people I work with are awesome. But Dillard's is a very drama-filled culture and it's very hard to succeed because they set kind of unrealistic goals.
bad,"Dillards certainly isn't for everyone. It pays well for retail work, but that doesn't make up for the managers that lack education and are just plain inconsiderate. All the managers care about are sales. There are some good managers that work there, but they are few and far between."
bad,"It was a great environment before the recession in 2007, we had great management team. But after 2008 changes all around the store with new management with no experience at all.  Made very difficult for employees to work in that environment.  Management walk like they new everything but were very unprofessional."
bad,I work in Ladies Shoes. You spend an half and hour to an hour depending your work status. You assist customers in finding shoes. Management is good. Co-workers are helpful and useful most of the time.
bad,"A typical day at work included managing the swimsuits and making sure they were in a appealing position on the wall.Also, Cleaning out dressing rooms, and making sure to persuade customers to buy a swimsuit. I learned how to be calm in collective in a work environment with catty people, along with management that didn't exactly know what they were doing. The hardest part of the job was making sure I met my quota for the day in selling, and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know all about swimsuit sizing, fitting and helping customers find what looked best on them."
bad,not bad place to work good play . has a high sph that no one meets. great co-workers
bad,you can work part time and then go full time but either way you really don't have a set schedule.
bad,"Oh man, what can I say you have 6 months to a 1yr of great pay then you get pay cuts, and fired. "
bad,"Top names brands very expensive, less known items better on you budget and just as stylish. Look for the sales, bound to find something just right for you , brand names at 70% off, worth waiting for. Cosmetic's great with giving away gift sets if you buy a item at a reasonable price . The newest perfumes testers are out to try the many wonderful smells of costly, and not so costly perfumes. The shoes are on sale racks piled in an area where the prices are right for your pocketbook, smart and stylish. The sales girls are pushed to sell their product in the department their working at reaching their quota on how much to sell that day, or any day they work. It is not comfortable having sales clerks coming at you from all ends of the store, let me  just look when I'm ready I will go to the nearest cash register... most all the customers feel like their being pushed to choose a sales clerk, makes you want to run out the door. I really enjoyed helping a lady pick out an outfit that brought out the best in her figure, and coloration. Management was mostly concern with your sales, and nothing else. Push push those sales...."
bad,"Managed staff, organized work time. Management was awful!"
bad,"Management is horrible, not honest and hard to talk to. Co-workers are great depending on which department you are placed in. I learned good discipline and good customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers"
bad,Working at Dillards was normally always busy. Dillards had great customers that were always coming back for the great sales. It was easy to get to know people working here.
bad,Typical car dealership not to big on changing their concept to the times.
bad,You would have to ring up 3800.00 on a shift other wise it rolled over to the next day.... IMPOSSIBLE...... Review and then lower your wages. Next review laid off.....You have no time with family... Great sales......
bad,"A typical day was to open registar for the sales day, clean te area to be ready for our customers, merchandise the floor with new items as they arrived on the floor, helped in other departments if needed, etc. I had a good floor manager she taught me well.My co-workers were ok with me we got along well. Trying to keep up with sales goal got a little hard when the economy change. I enjoyed my customers most of all."
bad,"I met some great people at Dillards. The management team at my particular Dillards was amazing! They really cared about you as a person and wanted you to succeed. Unfortunately, this is the only positive thing I can say about my employment at Dillards. As a result of the SPH standards, there was a lot of hostility between the associates. Unlike most retail companies that require their associates to sale, Dillards does not pay commission. Associates are given raises or paycuts based upon their hourly sales. Now, a little friendly competition is normal in a sales environment but the level of competitiveness is so crazy in this company that I have witnessed physical fights between associates in front of customers. Also, Dillards does not have a human resource department. So even if a coworker is caught doing some unethical practice (stealing, putting returns under a coworkers number, giving away merchandise) it gets brushed under the rug. One aspect of the job I was not particularly fond of was the cold calling. Most customers would give us their information to alert them of sales and special events. I felt like the calls we had to make to the customer when the store was slow just to invite them in were unappreciated. I have been employed over 10 years and I have never experienced a company like Dillards. While I was thankful to find employment, the environment there is very hostile and I would not like to experience that again."
bad,"Dillard's is a good company to work for but it has very many flaws. They expect you to meet difficult sales quotas everyday even if there are no customers around. Your quota doesn't change at all and they don't take to account that it is not busy. The raises are determined how good you do on your sales, If you get a raise, your quota goes up as well, the more you get paid the more you have to sell. However; if you don't meet your sales goal, they cut your pay by at least $1. If you get a pay cut below the base pay they fire you from a blink of an eye. I've been there for 2 years and have seen people that have been working for Dillard's for more than 10 years getting fired for just sales, hard worker employees. Dillard's only determines how good you are only by the numbers, not how hard you work on a department or customers."
bad,I liked the department I was in which was cosmetics the people I worked with were great as well as the cosmetic manager. I did not like that I had to get a certain amount of credit apps to be eligible for a Saturday off. I also did not like that there are NO Saturdays off NO exceptions for the entire month of November and December due to they're holiday months. The thing I did not like the most is the constant pushing of credit apps for the Dillard's credit card as well as any promotion that was going on at the time.
bad,The only positive thing I have to say about Dillard's is that I had an incredible department manager. I completely disagree with the way the company is managed and the way the workers are treated.
bad,I assistant my department manager in making sure the visuals are nice and neat and in order. I also have a daily quota that I have to make in sales.
bad,I have worked for Dillards on two different occasions. I will never work there again. They treat their employees horribly.
bad,"I had fun working as a cashier, serving customer, sales floor associate, I learned to serve customer the best I can do, I did not handle management, my co-worker we're have fun worke with me"
bad,"Just like many retail stores, the management expects a certain amount of sales if you do not meet those sales quotas after a while they start docking your salary. This problem created hostility amongst the employees. We would often argue over customers and sales being ""stolen"". The pressure to get a certain amount of people to sign up for the Dillard's Credit card was absolutely ridiculous and stressful because if you did not get at least one credit card sign up in a certain amount of time you could get fired. The only reason why I stayed as long as  I did is that my Section's Supervisor in Accessories was an absolute Sweetheart. Soon as she left all of her section's employees followed, including me!"
bad,"If you have a family stay clear, poor work life balance. Pay is ok but over demanding sales quotas creates a negative work environment. Don't call in sick."
bad,"Manager in position not qualified or not hold positions Title not professional show different in employee do not make new comings feel Welcome. "
bad,It can be good .... but that wasn’t my overall experience   Some people make it less than ideal. I didn’t even bother to talk to management as I didn’t feel it would do any good. I WILL NOT fight for sales. Not for me. I don’t like the person it turns me into. I would just rather go somewhere else.
bad,"Depending who you are as an associate depends on how you will be treated. Some workers may be able to get away with missing shifts frequently, whereas others may be terminated for missing one."
bad,"Retailer pays above average hourly pay, however the sales goals are highly unrealistic and associate responsibilities are more than normal retail environments."
bad,The pay is probably the fairest part of Dillard's..Being the E commerce is so prevalent it is hard to reach your sales goals. They are big on being late.  They are big about clocking out on time.
bad,"I worked during holiday season, and you are expected to work a lot of hours... work was tedious, not a lot of support... people that don't do their share are not fired because of high sales, which causes tension"
bad,"The policies at Dillards make it a cut-throat atmosphere with all the employees scrambling to meet their quotas. I thoroughly enjoyed helping the customers find exactly what they were looking for. And especially liked when I could help them find something they loved but had never thought of or even considered before. At every review from my manager, I always met my quota or exceeded it, and got a raise with each one as well. I also earned the ""Pacesetter Award"" which means basically that I did my job and I did it well."
bad,Mandatory to clock in on time.  Always afraid of loosing job if minimum sales were not met on a daily basis.  Sales were always set high.  Would like to stay positive but find it difficult to do.
bad,i worked in the lake charles store management is a JOKE  they hire and fire so easily watch out because you are just a number to them they dont care about you ! only care about you making them money
bad,"The store management was awful. They will stick anyone they can into any role they have open and just cross their fingers to hope it works out, whether  the person has any experience doing related work or not, and then they get surprised and punish those who aren't successful. They don't care at all about the customer experience or the employees, it's all about meeting your daily sales numbers. You can't expect every employee in the building to sell thousands of dollars of product every day, whether its a big sale day or whether it's snowing and no one is shopping, yet you have forced all employees to remain at work... It also seemed like they would find any excuse to fire people."
bad,"I do not recommend working here if you want a career. They give you ridiculously high daily sales quotas(mine was $4,900 for one day in December), but neglect to ever tell you that returns will affect that quota negatively. Also, if you don't make your quota,  they will either cut your pay (something else they fail to mention in the hiring process) or they will fire you. My manager is awesome,  but other departments arent so lucky. It gets very competitive between coworkers because of quotas,  so don't expect a close knit family setting. They have a very high turn over rate. They dont drug test. Pay is great,  benefits are great...But for how long?"
bad,"Dillard's is a nice place to work to get paid. Aside from that, you've got petty managers, terrible culture between the associates and flat -out tackiness amongst everyone as a whole."
bad,"There lots of things that can cause stress working at Dillard's. First, the store management doesn't care about employee time off. Second is the sales per hour that the associate needs to sale, it is computer generated, it doesn't make no sense because most days it's dead slow but theres a goal that have to be made by the end of the day. Third, the management lack of appreciation to those employees that does really care about the job and the department and enjoy helping customers. There is no room for promotion for those who show excellent services. The last thing is raise, if you can't make your goal by the end of your review date, you'll stay at the same pay amount you started or worst you might even get fired."
bad,Hardest retail company to work for. If you have a hard work ethic and are determined you'll be successful. There is a lot of turnover and changes are rapid
bad,I was in cosmetics and that was an easy section to work in .  if you were in clothing the sales per hour or SPH was super high and extremely hard to meet especially during the holiday time
bad,"A typical day at work was very competitive and cut-throat.  I did learn how to be a good salesman at this job.  Certain areas of management were better than others.  Hardest part of the job was the quota they expected us to meet and the competitiveness.  However, I did meet a lot of new people and learned how to be a good salesman."
bad,"No matter how well you performed, if you weren't with the company for a long time (and most had no clue of how to really close sales) there was no progression.  There were plenty of times that I did way more than my job description, but never got an opportunity to apply for leadership positions, even with my leadership background.  The happiest day here was the day I left."
bad,"The pay was great, and some of the customers were great.  They came from all over the world, and I loved speaking to them about their experiences. The job isn't too difficult honestly."
bad,"I counted all the cash from every department cash register. I learned how to efficianltlry count money, makes audits, fill ATM'S, and handle the customer service desk. The management was not very helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unproffesional staff. The most enjoyable part was learning a new job."
bad,"Due to currently being employed with this company, I do not desire to disclose anything revolving my experience while employed with Dillard's company."
bad,They make it out to be a fun and easy going atmosphere and as soon as you start it's completely different. Very little training for full timers expect to work well over 40-50 hours in a week. Holidays sometimes over 60 hours. Part timers beware you have to work 27 hours no more and no less you will get in trouble for going over 27 hours
bad,"Excellent place to work at. However, advancement opportunities and job security are not always there. You could work harder than anyone else or even more, but if your sales are not up to par, you risk the chance of being let go."
bad,The management was the worse. The department I worked in only had me in it most of the time. I was cussed out the third day of being employed. The only enjoyable part of the day was the customers.
bad,"Higher management didn't appreciate hard work. I worked there for about 6 in a half years. I got promoted the first year from dock associate to Sales Support Manger. It was great at first, but as time past by new management wouldn't care about your performance. They were just there to collect a paycheck. Sadly to say that's the reason Dillard's is top 3 worst companies to work for."
bad,Hard to plan personal time with the anonymous scheduling. Unrealistic expectations. Sales staff can be hard to work with. Some have been there for 20 plus years and do not want to be open to new ideas.
bad,I worked at the Superstition Springs location. Besides the few friends I made It was absolutely miserable. They always only see the negative. Visits suck. It's just big wigs telling you all the things you did wrong.
bad,"The company itself is at a stand still. Their way of selling is not old school and non sincere. There's not much wiggle room with dress code either. Quotas are unrealistic and could possibly cause you to lose your job. Management varies. I like half of them. I will say there is not favoritism, which is a plus! Everyone carries their own load with no exceptions."
bad,I currently hold cash position with room for no advancement.. I have not had a pay increase in 3 years my position is cap . My position I am cashier .Store audit position .cash room ATM money handling .Store operator and cust/service ...
bad,"This is a sales environment, cut throat if you aren't lucky enough to work with good people. Horrible customers, but you have to deal with that everywhere if you're in customer service. You're treated bad (no raise, no promotion, etc.) if management doesn't like you, regardless of your work performance. But if management likes you, you get the shifts you want, raises, etc. The company policies are some of the worst I've ever seen, they do not care about their employees AT ALL. The one saving grace...they do have a decent starting wage for retail."
bad,"good customer services, good place to work and get along with employees. some customers will give u a hard time but over all it ok."
bad,"If you are a competive person this is the job for you.  Competiveness in a sense keeps the job interesting.  You must be able to meet sales goal in order to exceed in this company.  Higher management/corporate is all about the money and almost seems to careless about employees.  I learned to ""stand my ground"" with this job."
bad,"The pay was very good and the physical demands of the job were nice. However, my schedule changed every day without notifying me, the sales associates would be rude along with management and they denied a request for lunch on a 13 hour shift. Great pay but managed very poorly."
bad,Good place to work at just became very difficult to go from part time to full time. Great benefits and good environment. They are very strict on putting people who want to go from part time to full time. not everyone wants to be part time for the rest of their life.
bad,"The management staff was pleasant enough but the culture at Dillard's is not based upon team work.  As a new employee with a lot of retail experience other associates were less than friendly and some were downright hostile.  Much to my chagrin, I displaced another employee who continued to resent me for the rest of my tenure.  I often worked alone and had to beg employees from other departments to keep an eye on my department so I could use the restroom."
bad,"A typical day at Dillard's consist of making a certain quota in order to reach sell goals. Management at the time were stern with an iron fists, however, some of the management were friendly. The co-workers there were very gossipy and vindictive. The hardest part about the job was standing on your feet all day on hard concrete and sell quota. You had a certain sell quota to meet everyday and if it was not meet, then that quota rolled over to the next day, regardless if there were no customers in the store, it still had to be met. The atmosphere was a typical ""fight and survive""/""dog-eat-dog"" type relationship. Nothing really was enjoyable about the job."
bad,I enjoyed the job itself but not the fact that this was a contracting job so I was eventually laid off due to end of contract. I installed meters here and turned power off and on. I enjoyed working outdoors and meeting new people.
bad,"In Dillard's, I sold men and women fragrances and provided customer interaction.I meet sales goals every week and provided a clean and neat display of fragrances and cosmetics.I was responsible for completing sanitary cosmetic procedures and providing great and efficient customer service.I was also responsible for providing fragrance consulting and a helpful environment for the customer."
bad,"I worked at Dillards for 5 Months, I was paid well, but the employees got very competitive and rude with the sales goals because each goal is individual when it should probably be by department. Management did not really care about the problems they only cared if you got your sales. I loved interacting with the customers and working with some employees there, but due to the ""drama"" i decided to put in my two weeks notice and find something better."
bad,"The managers at Dillard's are rude and tend not to speak to their employees when at work. However, when they do talk to them, they don't talk to them in a respectful way."
bad,"Dillard's is an okay place to work, they pay decently for entry level positions and make your job very clear. What they do  not make clear, however, is that all to often from the moment you step on the sales floor you become a number. And you as said number are supposed to sale and make the company money. Those who sale and often ignore other duties such as stock and staging of displaying and mannequins are rewarded for making the corporation more money and the management view them often as the ""backbone"" of the store. While the others who do the grunt work often get ignored, sales stolen from them, and are often snubbed by the management. This for me personally was made up for by working with some amazing employees who understood that we were in it together and we would all help eachother."
bad,"I was very excited to work for Dillards but after a month or so, you find out that they really dont care about you. Management doesnt even look your way even though you say hi. If your not management then your no one.I have never seen a company fire so many people. You were always worried your next, that some one is going to tap you on the shoulder. Thats how they do it. They have some wonderful associates but that doesnt matter to them. I had to walk out and move on."
bad,I worked there for about a year and a half. I was called in to work on my days off a lot and the owner laid me off 10 days before Christmas last year.
bad,I love the people I work with but Dillard's management is terrible.  They never back up their employees or follow any procedures. It is hard to try to enforce return policies when your managers don't back you up. The pay is decent but the managers are always nagging about something. The schedules don't get posted until a day before you need them so it is terrible trying to plan for anything in advance.
bad,my coworkers were enjoyable. the best part of the job was meeting people and the discount on clothing. Great place to work
bad,"Dillard's has the potential to be a really good company and a comfortable place for its employees. Problem is, is that Dillard's cares about one thing and one thing only SALES...screw the customer and the employee for that matter as long as Dillard's makes a dollar. Honestly, as I walked into those doors everyday I was miserable. Everyday was a constant battle with other associates to get a sale of $7 to try and reach an unobtainable goal that 90% of the time exceeded $1500 (on a Tuesday afternoon!). It's a really uncomfortable environment to work in not only for the employees but for the customer. I distinctly recall customers leaving because they were being harassed by associates. Aside from that Dillard's also hounds you about credit applications which by the time I left determined whether or not you got a weekend off...The ONLY upsides to working for Dillard's is the INITIAL PAY (notice I said initial), the discount, which considering how expensive everything in Dillard's is is really helpful; and lastly you get an hour lunch."
bad,"Everything you do during the day all boils down to personal sales goals. It doesn't make how hard you work or how good you are at what you do it you aren't making your sales, your aren't working to your potential."
bad,"A typical day would consist of helping customers with their need and wants in any way that is possible, merchandising new and current product, markdowns. My manager was wonderful, she was very organized and recognized her employees for their hard work. co-workers were fun to work with but not much of a team environment."
bad,I would never work for this company again the starting pay is good but that only last for so long your pay is determined on how much you sale you have to generate sales to keep ypur job they give you these crazy quotas examples 700 a day and you would only see two customers your whole shift and what ever amount you dont reach they attach it along to the next day added to your new one. you can lose your job in six months.
bad,"pay ok, management ok, benefits ok, long hours, standing and walking a lot"
bad,"The store manager did whatever he wanted; he fired people just because “they’re not Dillard’s material”. Having to open credit apps left some associates panicking because of the credit class on Sunday, the credit class was were the talked up credit apps. Associates that didn’t open a credit for the week had to attend, even if you’re not scheduled to work that Sunday. Getting customers to open credit apps, seemed almost like you were manipulating them. “If you open a credit app today, I’ll take 10% off each item”; that’s how some associates got theirs. Some associates even committed credit fraud to get one for the week. This place stressed me out, I was would go to work wondering if it the day was my last day. I was pretty good with opening credit apps the right way, but it was still stressful. People, who didn’t deserve a promotion were, and those who did deserve it didn’t get it. This company was unfair to  good number of people. Don’t work here. Yeah the pay is nice, but it’s not worth it in the end."
bad,"Working at Dillard's can be great for some and they pay their associates better than any other retailer I know. However as a manager, they expect you to have very little work/life balance."
bad,"When it was good it was good, but brick and mortar retail sales are declining company wide and Dillard's is the last of the fashion retail dinosaurs. Raises for the past 2 years have been insulting, senior employees have all quit and their not filling the job openings at all, yet still expecting the same level of productivity, management is remote and impossible to communicate with."
bad,Great place to work in college to get tips and learn the roles of customer service. Not a career and no clear career path. Managers and employees fostered great environment to work
bad,"I only worked for Dillard’s so long because the pay is so good, but there is a reason for that. Dillard’s strives on their sales, of course. They do not care about their employees at all. They will only keep you if you are making them money. Obviously we all do, as we are sales associates, but the more you sold, the more you can get away with. One girl caused arguments almost weekly with coworkers and wouldn’t get in trouble. She even put her hands on another coworker and wasn’t fired. The girl who she touched actually quit because of this and they didn’t care. I also quit after having multiple breakdowns from how ruthless they were. I once got told why I wasn’t on the floor selling when I couldn’t stop crying in the bathroom. On myAnother female tried to fight me while at work and was not fired and that is what led me to finally quit. They are horrible. The pay is not worth it. I went back to a minimum wage job after this for my own sanity. Everything about Dillard’s is awesome except their management and values."
bad,If you want a job that pays for doing nothing just stand around and talk to coworkers this is the job for you! Was literally bored out of my mind. Dillard’s is only busy when they have sales (depending on department) or during the holidays .The makeup ladies who been working at the store In Palmdale are just so nosey and dramatic they are like teenagers in high school.Everyone also fights for sales too they’ll get at your face about it
bad,"Dillard's can be a great place to work if you are honestly solely focused on sales, come into work and think about only your sales goals, whereas your management in the store cares about your well being and care about their employees upper management only cares about how much money you are making them. If you cannot keep up with sales this is not the job for you."
bad,"The manager was very strict in the interview. I just wanted to add if you don’t have a gpa of 4.0 he will make you feel as if you aren’t smart enough to work there. He also added if you don’t make enough sales in three months, they will let you go."
bad,"With over 20 years of retail experience and 15 years of upper management experience and two Bachelors degrees, I was somewhat stunned to be offered a sales clerk position and $12 an hour. But the store manager was friendly and promised me a $3 an hour raise as soon as my first 30 days were over. He also promised me a promotion. As you can guess, neither happened. "
bad,Expect the same with most department stores. Management goes back and forth between slack on totally overwhelming. Very inconsistent. Pay is good if you don't mind giving up all holidays and weekends.
bad,Given unrealistic sales goals.  Hire people at a high rate and fire them within six months for not reaching sales.  Horrible working environment with associates fighting for sales.
bad,"I was a manager and stepped down. I can tell you first hand that in my store there was a lot of shady nonsense happening, and I frequently sat in on meetings that seemed like they were designed to make us feel unsafe in our jobs. I very much enjoyed being an associate, and if you have the sales chops there's decent money to be made here. If you're thinking you want to promote upward ... just don't."
bad,"This job is super easy for a sales specialist, but they do not really promote for within and also they do not point out people who are doing well at their job."
bad,Friendly people outside of work are turned into cutthroat pushy sales people by an uncomfortable sales/hour system that breeds unhealthy competition. Managers are nice as long as you get credit card applications.
bad,"It was indeed a learning and competitive experience. I exploited a unique and semi-stress full work culture due to the motivated and positive staff on board. I spent my day calculating my quota to ensure a successful day, and learning the various meanings and concepts of woman's  foot wear."
bad,"an average day is very slow. very little customers in store so hard to make sales when you are selling kids shoes. Dillards is more of an rich older custtomers,"
bad,"Fast paced, busy work environment with a fashion forward company. Lots to learn an do everyday. Opportunity for advancement at each and every level."
bad,"This job caused so much stress that I had to quit because of panic attacks and anxiety. We made a base amount and then sales over a certain amount would qualify for commission. We had other employees out to steal clientele and would also hide fitting room keys (whoever let the customer in the fitting room ""claimed"" their purchases). When I brought it up to management they ignored me. After leaving the company I found out the cheating employee was promoted for his foul behavior."
bad,This job was very competitive in sales. I worked with 3 girls in my department. They would see customers and just jump like they were fishes catching bait. It wasn't bad but there was a lot of drama.
bad,If you need family health insurance. This company is very expensive. They pay ok but not enough to compensate for the added expense of the health insurance.
bad,"Before applying to Dillard's, I went online and read the reviews of what working for this company would be like. 90% of them were negative. Despite this, I decided to still give it a try and continued on with the employment process. Throughout my time there, a short lapse of 6 months, I began noticing the absence of professionalism there was among the managers. If you did not bring them food, they would pick on you throughout the day."
bad,Was initially excited about the opportunity but the excitement quickly dissipated. Working at Dillard's was a toxic workplace where co-workers are pitted against each other to compete for sales at the cost of the overall customer's store experience.
bad,"They expect you to make a sales quota and if you don't you get fired the quota is ridiculous , every one is out for blood because your always afraid of losing your job. I personally do not like or enjoy working in this kind of environment ."
bad,"Dillard's is a very difficult company to work for."
bad,"Easy work flow. Learned more about sales, co workers were fun to work with and learned from one another. Hardest part was the sales. Enjoyable part was meeting new customers and helping them with their needs."
bad,"I worked at the St. John's Town Center Dillard's. The only thing I liked about working there was the people I personally worked with in my department. When you start working at Dillard's, you're brainwashed into taking the job because of the pay. Depending on what department you get placed in, determines the success you will have working there. Typically the departments who are successful are shoes, fragrances, cosmetics, mens, kids, petites, home, accessories, handbags, some ladies departments. There were a lot of misunderstandings in my department, and I was expected to reach my unattainable SPH. If you don't make your quota, expect a pay cut. If you get a pay cut after 11.75, you WILL be terminated. Working in my department sucked because my department was hard to make sales in. You're expected to open up credits each month btw. In terms of management, there were numerous times I emailed my management about certain situations in my department, all went UNHEARD, and was not fixed. I felt as if we employers had no voice, and the managers only cared about those who made their sales. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the people who I worked with in my department. It was because of them I stayed, but they all left too, so that says something. I don't see how the full-time employees stand that place. Glad I left!"
bad,"I personally wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you are very confident about your abilities to sell stuff. It's a dog eat dog world in there. You have quotas you have to make or you get a pay cut, no matter the hours you have for that day or week. Turn over rate is very high."
bad,"When you come on for your shift, you would have to put up the new stock of clothing that had came in the morning. The fun part of it was all the new designs and rearranging the store from season, sales and brands. The employees were the best. We made it fun and when everyone had made their quota and someone did not we would help them to get to that point. The manager in the beginning was great and helped us out as much as she could. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after customers that would destroy the dressing room or even the floor."
bad,Horrible place to work if you have or start a family. You get a dollar pay cut if you don't meet your yearly sells goal and possibly terminated. The trick to meeting this goal is that all things you sell that is returned subtracts your sell goals in which puts you further in the hole. Management was not fair with many things. I felt and was treated like an animal working for my owner....
bad,In order to keep your job here you may have to steal sells from other associates and stalk customers. it's not worth your sanity. management is good in some depts but others are horrible. I've learned nothing from this job that any other retail company teaches you.
bad,Management played favorites. Coaching was terrible and supervisors keeping you up to date on personal progress was terrible. Associates we're great. Unrealistic sales goals to reach and Management was not very good at helping employees succeed in sales.
bad,"managers are unorganized, job security is very low, they are diverse and have good pay but too stressing."
bad,Management has been quick to let people go for various reasons.
bad,"Customer service ,special orders.Worked well with others."
bad,"Executive management is wonderful to work for; however, no training guidelines for managment"
bad,The work is definitely easy but you will be expected to do a lot without information from your managers so you’ll get in trouble in the end. Managers are terrible. Managers definitely have favorites and it’ll always be the ones who do the least so work hard and get no recognition and be ready to get disrespected a lot by managers.
bad,The store is not very busy anymore because so many people are shopping online.  A lot of the time is just spent organizing and cleaning the department.  Shipment will come in and you have to put that out and relocate older pieces to a different part of the department. Assist customers to the dressing rooms. Put out the proper marketing for the current sales event and do markdowns as instructed.
bad,"This by far has been one of the worst jobs I have ever been at. Management is awful, and my coworkers are rude. "
bad,"I enjoy helping customers find the right clothing and jewelry that fit their style and personality. I have learned to strive to meet goals with a smile and my best foot forward. I've realized that once an employee advances at Dillard's, there is not much room to move forward, though. I would like to find a new company with more opportunities."
bad,There were to many things going on it wasn't a good fit. The management was not how I expected it to be. Maybe at a different location the environment would be different.
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. Lack of management, very low salary in comparison the hours and the work you put on. If you are thinking how you’ll balance your personal life with the work it’s not the ideal place to work. JUST DON’T APPLY."
bad,Management doesn’t care about its employees. Customers who shop at the particular Dillard’s I was in are extremely rude. Don’t work here if you want a job that works with you and where there’s actually growth within the company
bad,"Although I learned so much about myself and my skills as a professional, the hostile work environment and company culture was what truly shifted my overall satisfaction. Standards were simply all over the place, even though company preaches about consistency. The most enjoyable part was being able to help individuals grow in their careers and watching them succeed."
bad,Great place to work if you need quick money until you can find a decent paying job with benefits. They pay is not to bad so it will hold you over until you can move on
bad,Great group of guys to work with in the maintenance department. freedom to do things the way you need to but recent changes are changing the future possibly. its looking like everything may start getting contracted out.
bad,Dillard's hires you and the interview they tell you that in three months you may or may not have a job. They are always on you for sales performance but offer nothing to help.
bad,"Dillards will do one very good thing for you: it will train you for every situation imaginable. "
bad,"Good hours and pay schedule can be flexible other then that I wouldn't recommend this to be a prolonged opportunity, your job is constantly in jeopardy and the management  horrible."
bad,Working here was the a clear cut dead end job. It was clear from the beginning that room for advancement was slim to none. I highly recommend to stay far away from working here.
bad,"Just don't do it. The pay is not worth having to constantly deal with the drama from having to steal sales from people. You have to care more about your sales then the customer in front of you, and you always have to push credit cards and if management doesn't like you, you're a goner no matter how great you are at your job. People have been fired from my old store just because they didn't want to sleep with the boss. People were fired for standing up for themselves. People were fired for doing the right thing. It's just not worth it."
bad,"Your pay is based upon how much you ring up in an hour making for extremely competitive work environment"
bad,Pays better than your adverse retailer but pay is based on sales per hr so environment becomes hostile frequently. Management turnover is extremely high so there is constant rule and policy changes.
bad,"Overall I loved working for the company, but at times I felt like I was being over worked and treated unfairly. The full-time employees were treated better than part-time associates and didn't have to perform the same work duties as other associates. I gained tons of pointers and useful tips at being a sales associates. I worked directly with clients and built life long friendships with some in which I found to be the best part of working in sales and the commission of course."
bad,"The job is commission based so no matter how much you sell that day, if the customer changes there mind and returns it, ths return will count against your sales for that day."
bad,managers were terrible. lack of experience treating the employees.. the prices were way to high and the team work was good. but the managers were bad.  the most enjoyable time was inventory and changing the stuff around and fixing the fixtures
bad,"I worked loss prevention for Dillard's and did enjoy some of the job and the co-workers.  I however, did not enjoy some of the management and the way that things were handled with job duties. I did enjoy my position and the excitement it came with, I didn't like some of the policies they had with loss prevention which resulted in a lot of money lost and more thefts getting away."
bad,This job is very competitive. They always want you to meet their assigned sales per hour. If you are not a strong sales person then I do not recommend this job.
bad,Its an okay place of employment. There is a lot of drama there. But it paid the bills. So its okay. The starting pay is good at 9.00 US DOLLARS an hour!
bad,Poor and demeaning management. The staff was great and trustworthy but the store manager was very unfair and unprofessional. Must meet daily sales goal in order to be paid more every three months.
bad,"Very routine work, a lot of superficial feelings between managers, coworkers are very nice and have became friends, a lot of micromanagement, I feel over-qualified for my job, and culture comes off as tense/difficult to get comfortable with."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Dillards, although I had to quit due to the ""whoever has worked here the longest"" policy. I utilized this position part time as I was a full-time student and mom. I worked whenever I was asked to, holidays included, never calling off work for any reason. On my son's 1st birthday, I asked for the weekend off to go back home to celebrate with family. And I was denied. Took that as my time to leave because I always put my child first."
bad,"Working for this company has made me bitter towards the retail world. Managers are always changing, associates quit as fast as they get hired. Quota demands are too high."
bad,My favorite part of working there was dressing the mannequins and making my floor look presentable. At first all seemed greats and wonderful the people were nice and then once your probation its like going to war. You have to meet price quotas that seem ridiculous but i guess it really depends on where your store is located.
bad,Typical days on the sales floor were unpredictable every day.  Management was pretty stressful and did not work with schedules.
bad,"Dillard can be a good place to work at if you are a great sales person or you are single. You have to meet your daily quota and it's all about numbers. It's a great place to meet new people. Most times, it gets very competitive because everyone has a quota to fill. It can become very overwhelming and exhausting to deal with customer's issue , coworker's conflicts and meeting your sale's demand. The job schedule is various and you do not get a set time schedule or days. It's very difficult to get a request approve for day offs  due to the many employees. You will highly miss out on weekends cookout, birthdays, and even holidays besides Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas day."
bad,There is no doubt that the customers give me the most enjoyment as I continue to work at Dillards. I work with some of the greatest people as co-workers.
bad,"A lot of standing, making yourself available for all customers. Learned good money handling skills and customer service skills. Management was decent but did not really care for their employees, just sales."
bad,"If it were not for the customers, I would dislike the job. I would of maybe chosen a different department to work in, because I would of done better in another department."
bad,Shoe Sales Specialist. Enjoyed all of my customers and working with the public on a daily basis. I am accustomed to the sales field.
bad,"My main duty was to be knowledgeable on our new and upcoming clothing items, assist customers with purchases and questions they may have and most importantly make the customers feel welcome to a personable experience so they will want to return."
bad,"My typical day would consume of makeup applications and cosmetics sales. I learned lots of makeup artist tips. I was not too fond of Management. Not very personable, rude at times. My co-workers were a diverse bunch. In sales environment, they were a bit ""sales hungry"" but they were are cool otherwise. The hardest part of the job was being told by your manager to sell more, but it was often slow. Most enjoyable part of the job was performing makeup applications."
bad,"The requirements of the employees that work at Dillards are unrealistic, unfair and stressful. At the time I was employed, lack of communication between the departments of management were non-existent."
bad,I learned how to sell credit cards. I did not care for management. I enjoyed being able to troubleshoot costumer makeup needs and teaching makeup applications to clients.
bad,"A typical day starts with opening up your department, clearing wrap stands and in general just get your area ready for the day. You do have a quota to keep and management will fire anyone who is not meeting their quota. I feel like there is miscommunication throughout the levels of management which is taken out on sales associates. The pay is good if you can keep up your quota. They do hire good employees most of the time. There is always a project or something to do."
bad,"high expectations to meet sales quotas, build and retain clients, and solicit credit. very strict policies and not enough support"
bad,"Uncoordinated management, out-of-date facilities and technology. Merchandise is out-of-style and outdated, clientele is generally unpleasant."
bad,this is the same as previous. It was a great job but I would like to do something in my field of study. I learned so much and met wonderful people.
bad,"Dillard's provides employees with many opportunities. It is a very competitive work environment. I learned a lot about perfume, how it's made, how long it takes, and high-end brands. I also learned how to apply makeup on people professionally. I learned a lot about brands like Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, and many other. Management was good but very indirect. My co-workers were wonderful, smart, hard-working and glamorous women. The hardest part of the job was coping with the stress of making your numbers. The best part of the job was the great people that I met and the professionals that taught me so much in meetings."
bad,Responsible for daily cash count at beginning of each from prior day sales.  Provided sales personnel with change from vault as needed during day.  Returned / exchanged merchandise as needed.
bad,People are great to work with.  The company not so much.  High sales goals are given to each employee. Causes tension between employees and customers.  Forces employees to battle with each other.
bad,"its okay, the goals are crazy on dead days. you still have to make the goal even if there's no one in the store"
bad,This job payed well however they give you sales quotas that increase as you keep meeting them.  Eventually you get to the point where you cannot meet those goals anymore but they maintain you at that level until they fire you of not meeting them.  Upon asking they will not lower your sales goals at all so they will not assist you in becoming a better sales associate.
bad,"Everyday includes greeting and assisting customers with women's apparel and directing them to any other part of the store they would like. Dillard's managers trained me on markdowns, how to properly merchandise apparel and how to order apparel to be sent to customers homes. The hardest part about working at Dillard's is trying to meet a high sales goal every work day. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers and having them leave with a smile on their faces."
bad,"horrible company to work for, termination for not achieving sales goal with little to no coaching"
bad,Management was awful and overly aggressive. Very stressful place to work.
bad,"At Dillard's, Inc. I learned the value of customer service and most enjoyed interacting with customers and fellow associates."
bad,"A typical day at dillards is stocking merchandise, giving good customer service. I've learn how to connect better with customers so I am able to help them with their needs. The hardest part of working at dillards is trying to meet customers needs and wants. The most enjoyable part of Dillards is meeting customers and putting smiles on their faces while building a trustworthy relationship."
bad,a typical day entails mainly playing a waiting game for customers to approach your department. With working in the men's denim department there arent as many customers as you would like there to be in order to keep you busy
bad,"Policies and procedures make it hard to make sales goals, which results in pay cut"
bad,They have a horrbile turn-over rate.  The only people that make it in this company are cut-throat people
bad,"Again I really love the work here, much more responsibility then one might think. I maintain all heating and air equipment, life and fire safety, electrical lighting in many voltages. Although there is much responsibility it is far less than I am accustomed to in my previous position as facilities operations manager with local Department of Corrections. "
bad,Excellent pay. Hard to maintain your sales per hour unless your in a high volume store.
bad,"Most enjoyable part is helping clients."
bad,"Clean"
bad,Hard to get credit applications.
bad,Loved working here until I was accused of something I didn't do and was fired. The person who did it kept her job and I was sent away.
bad,"i learned how to gift wrap really well. I basically answered phones, helped customers with their credit card accounts and gave change to sales associates. Management came off as ""too good to talk to you."" If you aren't a girly girl, I suggest you look somewhere else to work."
bad,The managment and pay scale is very down grading to one. If sales arnt made you receive a pay cut. Not the best way to motivate a person.
bad,"very enjoyable place to work,nice co workers and managers,very laid back.the hardest part of the job was not having the merchandise in stock that the customer needed."
bad,"inflexible working hours, low pay, customer assistance.Must enjoy helping people"
bad,Designing apparel for Dillard's private label. Family company that grows every year. Micro managing from top to bottom.
bad,Sales goals makes for an overly competitive workplace which results in poor customer service
bad,"They work their managers to death! I worked around 60 hours a week for a base of 35k. Nothing more, nothing less. I think it averaged out to like 6 dollars an hour."
bad,"Retail is a difficult job. It is very stressful and not the ideal job for some people. People can be very rude and disrespectful, customers and employees. I left to due to being extremely unhappy and stressed out."
bad,Standing for 7 to eight hours on your feet with no customers. Unfair working conditions and late working hours. It lacks fairness in workplace and storewide. Quota not made for lack of business.
bad,"The workplace culture is ok. Personally, I enjoyed my job to a point. There is some favoritism, but that's beside the point; you find that mostly all over."
bad,"If you like standing around not doing much for hours on end, then this is a good job for you. I loved my manager, but despised the job and the environment."
bad,The store has it's ups and downs. Management really has no idea whats going on and will promise you something then go back on their word a month or two later. I did  however love the atmosphere and the people at my counter were amazing!
bad,"Retail life is rough. Long work shifts, working during holidays, and no weekends off is enough to encourage anyone to look for another job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount"
bad,"It was a good experience working at Dillard's. I learned about merchandising, selling and worked with nice customers for the most part."
bad,If like to be in a literal shark tank than this is the job for you. With that being said Dillard’s is what you make of it. If you can do crazy work hours and very high quotas with no customers then this is for you.
bad,When your hired your treated like gold. Given alot of information on the company and merchandise. But if you do anything that makes the store manager angry she will do anything to get rid of you. Even if it's making up lies.
bad,"The work it self is easy an fun. you get to help customers find their perfect outfit, walk around your assigned area and make sure everything is in place, and change the mannequins in your area. The bad part is the management. I was lucky to have a great floor manager he was helpful and supportive, but the general store manger, was everything but that."
bad,My co-workers were amazing and they made it more fun to learn and do work duties. The most enjoyable part of my job was handling the register and interacting with great customers and helping them out always.
bad,It was a different type of retail compared to what I had done in the past. I got to work with some really unique and good people. It jus was not what  I was doing and loving at the time. Management was poor and I disagree with how they run the store day to day.My day consist of straightening merchandise and attending to guest.
bad,this company has a quota and your pay drops or rises depending on your sales no matter how long you work and the location might not make the money so there goes your money
bad,"The environment at Dillards is very stressful. They have a quota system that is very outdated. The upper management (District and higher), are behind times in management styles. The seasoned associates whom are very professional, and skilled, are quickly replaced by newbies who have no idea of what is going on. The Area Managers are awesome (mine especially), and will do a lot for you, even their decisions are overridden by the bad decisions of the District and Regional Managers."
bad,"They start you out with a pay structure that is more than the national average, however, if you do not make your sales goal they can start taking it away."
bad,"Busy, and fast paced"
bad,"Sell merchandise to customers, inventory & pricing of merchandise,"
bad,"In my experience, Dillard's has been the worst job I've had. Here I was bullied by other associates, and when I had gone to management about it minimal was done. There is no HR to reach out to either which would have been extremely helpful if caught up in similar situations."
bad,"This company is a good company, has great benefits, has great department manager, you also have a good advancement in you career field, it is a good experience ."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Dillard's. My department manager was great, however, the store manager seemed to be a non-existent entity. He was not around much. When he was out on the sales floor walking around, he did not introduce himself to anyone and did not seem very personable."
bad,"I love my co-workers, we all got along. I learned how important customer service was, and that was the mos enjoyable part of my job. I love to help people and love working with the public."
good,"So basically this is a strictly part time there's no way to get full time, you need to make a quota and if you dont meet those number they can let you go."
good,"Low chance of raises, poor management staff, over worked employees, expected to do multiple employees jobs in addition to your own, but you get a 25% discount on all merchandise and salon services."
good,Toxic and cancerous employee-to-employee atmosphere. Management turns a blind eye to it. Lack of support from management. Big box greed. Was misled into what my job responsibilities would be.
good,I did something new everyday. It was fun and exciting to demo the drywall and learn how to properly lay a floor. Labor intense
good,"Unload and load merchandise, clearn, customer service. i learn some management skill and also some warehouze. Head management wasnt thankful. co-workers i love them. I really like the customers and merchandise"
good,It's good employment for part time or a college student that isn't taking a full credit course.    It may be difficult when shifts change and meeting the sales quota.
good,Dillards company has set up SPH (Sales Per Hour) to be unrealistic. The company thinks more sales associates on the sales floor more sales to be made.
good,Dillard’s is a OK job. I’ve been here for some time now. I think it’s a great job if you want to get yelled at by customer daily......................
good,If you didnt have  Merchandice to stock and no customers to attend to it made the day go slowly. Was always told to clean something.i enjoyed being able to make things look neat and working with the public.
good,"I dont have much to say about Dillards. They are doinig what they can to keep up with JC Penny, Macys and Nordstrom but doing a poor job in the process."
good,I enjoyed the pay that I made with this company and the customers that I got to meet. But having any situations happened in your personal life that makes you take time away from your job you get punished for.  This company refused to work with me on my medical issues and ended up writing me up for not being able to call before my shift due to being in the emergency room.
good,"They swindle you into changing your availability. And even if they don't, they will just automatically schedule you whatever they want anyways. There is absolutely no communication between floor and assistant managers when it comes to scheduling! NONE! Its very hard to meet their very high quotas and then they just fir you for it. Its not easy to work here."
good,"Count the cash drawer, assist to customers needs, set up merchandise, empty pallets and set up displays. Assist with returns and gift card sales,  Managers get very motivated . Every department could do promotions any way they preferred and very fun. The hardest part  was working  on unloading the shipments."
good,All personnel in the management positions should not be in the position. Personnel needs more training and guidance and better leadership skills and attitudes.
good,"If you are willing to be just a statistic that is only seen as a number to make the company money then you will love it here."
good,Management only cares about numbers they want you to sell more and more meeting your sales goal is almost impossible. If you don't make your numbers you get fired.
good,"Customer service oriented and coaching for associates. Hardest part of the job is trying to exceed high goals and long, restless days. Most enjoyable part of the job is the connection with clients and associates."
good,Managed the Origins makeup counter in a high-end department store with customer service focused recommendations and sales.
good,"Company does not respect that employee was dedicated, dependable and reliable. They base everything on sales goals"
good,"Liked getting the 2 depts I was assigned organized, then moved to another area & that was okay as well. Stayed mostly in Men's Dept. I liked helping customers to personally shop with them when they needed help, my ASM was nice & most of the full timer's that worked there were considerate and hardworking."
good,"Enjoyed the work, management was good, then alright, then not so good. When management changes, a lot sometimes changes."
good,"They do not care about their employees and managers are terrible. Employees hate each other because of ""quotas"" and it causes too much friction on the sales floor"
good,"A typical day at Dillard's is having to put up stock and shipment. In the mornings, head to customer service, get all markdowns/returns/online orders and complete before 11am. Usually short staffed but have to accomplish all markdowns, be able to sell unreasonable high quotas daily, push on sales and make sure you make your daily goal. Doesn't sound like much, until you have to work the whole department which includes the whole floor you are on with marking down every little item because of being so short staffed. Overall, I learned how to stand my ground and be competitive in sales. Management didn't really make a difference because when new hires show up, you are in charge of everything they will learn. Schedules were never updated or priority and you would get ""marked/tardy"" for school schedules when having been told what school schedules are a month ahead. The workplace culture seems like upper management doesn't like consider your needs, your life is revolved around Dillard's and it must happen that way. I have put this job before anything, even school and that was not right. The hardest part of the job is having employees not help in stock or any other because they want to meet sales goal, even that it's always short staffed and weak management, people do not want to do the labor. The most enjoyable is being able to dress up and help customers feel great! Having the smile on people's faces when they finally buy something nice for themselves and they feel happy about it. Overall, with the unbelievable sales goal, people are often fired by 3 months. The most people stay"
good,"Work Life balance not good.  Tons of visits by corporate which were geared to what was wrong but not what was right. Very negative visits and many conversations about who was weak in their position, but not about what we could do to get them to the next level."
good,The management pays no attention to the “new hires” or the ones that bring in little to no sales. They only focus on the people that have been there for years reguardless if they bring in money or not.
good,"The managers were absolutely awful.  They had no skills, no idea what they were doing and they were rude. Sales and employment was low because of the poor management."
good,"One thing I loved the most is that you are guaranteed an hour lunch and two 15 min breaks, you get to interact with people from different walks of life, to assist them with their beauty needs."
good,"Dillard's is a very hard job, even harder to keep your pay. You are constantly fussing with your fellow co-workers, for sales. Nothing fun about it. Poor management, does not treat everyone fair. I wish I can get the year and half back of my life I've waste there."
good,"Dillards offers a great discount to employees, excellent hourly pay for sales associates, but as a salaried manager it was the lowest paying salary position of my 30yr retail management history.  As an hourly associate they are inflexible when it comes to scheduling, you have to maintain sales goals to maintain your pay.  If you are willing to really sell you can make a decent hourly pay, but you have to be careful you are not assigned tasking duties that keep you busy while other associates make all the sales."
good,Numbers and sales are most important and it gives a competitive work environment although they push for team effort. Individuals are responsible for their sales.
good,"Terrible place to work. Management was terrible. The Palmdale store manager Sarah was one of the worst people Ive ever had the dissatisfaction of working withing. Management does not care about employees. Everyone is replaceable, just looking for a warm body to make the sales."
good,"When i was told that I was being let go my manager gave me the ultimatum of either giving him my ""two weeks"".  However when I gave him my two weeks notice he wouldn't let me work it.  He said he had already promised my scheduled hours to the new associate he had hired.  I was only labeled as a part time associate but I was working close to 35 hours a week with no benefits and very few breaks to no breaks.  Other than my manager and the whole hours situation - I enjoyed working for Dillards as a company."
good,"good pay "
good,My experience with this company was not the best. Management treated associates poorly and expected too much but were not willing to help or support in any way. It made for a tense work environment.
good,"Getting to met customer and helping with they choices"
good,I enjoyed working at dealing it was a wonderful job that worked around my college classes. I learned how to better speak with different types of people
good,horrible management. no place for advancement. never have a set schedule. most enjoyable are the customers. management is unrealistic. have to make your quota. focused on credit apps. you also have to cold call customers sto come in and you have to push on credit applications.
good,"I assisted customers in finding items in the store and online.  I cleaned fitting rooms and returned unwanted merchandise to the rack.  I completely inventory and created displays.  Additionally, I operated cash registers and cleaned my working area."
good,"A typical day in Customer Service department at DIllards involved a variety of tasks, which made the job interesting and enjoyable. First thing in the morning and then sparingly throughout the day, employees come up to get change...exchanging their large bills for smaller bills and coin. Throughout the day customers are referred from the sales floor to our department to resolve issues that need the approval of upper management. As customers at home or in other stores order items, we receive the orders, verify and document the customers mailing and billing info and preps it to go to the dock for shipping. In this position, I've learned to sharpen my multi-tasking and organizational skills, both especially useful when the day holds a variety of tasks, all with different expectations for completion and different processes. I've learned the art of prioritizing my duties correctly. My co workers were so helpful in my training! I enjoy working with them and learned so many things as they are also able to now learn from me.  The hardest part of the job is probably the standing on my feet for 8 hours.  The most enjoyable is interacting with the wonderful Dillard's customers. As we resolve issues and implement positive change, its nice to chat with the customers, hear what they came out for and direct them to exclusive sales events and markdowns as well as new arrivals and featured promotions."
good,"Great store but the management was horrible. I would not recommend working for this store in Collierville,TN."
good,"Overseeing employees daily tasks, ensuring sales goals were meet. Everyone got to know each other quickly. Slow traffic or slow seasons made reaching goals difficult. "
good,Good place to work if you can deal with public and enjoy the many satisfied shoppers that love the total experience of good customer service. It is an enjoyable company.
good,"Meh. The ideal employee here keeps their head down, numbers up, and mouth shut. Commission is a lie. You will most likely only see a commission in November and December."
good,"Overall, enjoyed working with the people in my area. Some managers were amazing, others... not so much. A lot of people just wanted to sell, and nothing else. People come and go. HAD to make quota and get credit apps, even on slow days. Would release schedules weekly, sometimes constantly changing."
good,The knowledge and experience gained was beneficial for future jobs but is not a reliable job for income nor any availablility for job advancement. Reaching your quota is pragmatically impossible based on the ratio of customers whom actually shop there when there isn’t clearance. Working for commission sounds nice until achieving sales becomes so frugal that it tears apart partnerships within the company.
good,Hard to work with people that don't want to help you grow. Management sucks and they do not care about the employees whatsoever. Very rude and demeaning managers.
good,It's an ok place to work.  Managers are not fit to be managers.  Everybody wants to be a smart . It use to be  fun working here.  They want you to push credit cards
good,"For a mall job the pay starts you in lower double digits an hour. You must learn your dept fast in order to maintain your sales quota. Ur pay is set but can go up or down depending on if you hit your goal. This can be done but you have to be a very engaging sales person to compete with other employees that have an already established a customer base. Veteran employees have higher quotas so they tend to be a tad ""cut-throat"" in obtaining sales. Benefits are there but are minimal. Hours are long, but if retail customer service is your niche it's a good place to go."
good,"working at Dillards is fine and not hard, its the management that is really hard to work with. They are bias and if for some reason you're a target they never leave you alone and are really disrespectful"
good,Dillard’s has far too much drama. They’re not flexible with hours and make workers do far more than they should. You get promoted based on your sales and it’s only .50 vents pay raise which isn’t anything.
good,The best thing about Dillard's were the discounts. The way is only based on Sales to keep your pay rate you have to maintain a certain quota. That meant you always had one person to do freight and merchandising and they would be on the loosing end of the quota scale. Breeds an air of contempt and not one of cooperation.
good,"Good pay, poor management. Absolutely no work life balance at all. I wanted to move up and right before I had to relocate they said they wanted to move me up. My store manager was not a good leader."
good,"Customer service "
good,"The area sales managers team is great and very supportive and all the associates and support team members are great to work with. However, retail hours do not allow for a work life balance and after a certain level opportunity for growth are limited."
good,"Great place for a part time job while you're in school or trying to save money. Not a place to grow a career and management varies store to store, you may get lucky but you may not."
good,"Competitive  and fast  paced  place to work. Co workers were great to work with. Worked with a great product. Did inventory control, cashier and provided customer service."
good,"The company is good to work if you're PT and that comes along with a cost.  There is no such thing as a weekend off and integrity.  Half of the management team there is more concerned about their looks versus servicing the customers.  No real training, majority of the training comes as a result of hands on expierence.    Sales goals are unrealistic."
good,"I worked there for a long time and it was awesome until new store management arrived. He changed everything about that store and for the worse. It used to be fun with a store manager that actually cared about the employees. He retired and we got a new Store Manager that didn’t care about anyone. Loyalty to Dillard’s meant nothing to him, he wants his “own people” in the store, and you can take that any way you want to. A lot of good, loyal people soon left including myself."
good,"A typical day as a Dillard's full-time sales associate was almost impossible, given that you are really socially awkward and/or not good at sales. For a full-timer, you're expected to sell about $1200/day even when there's no traffic. They supply ways to make customers into your own clients/clientele, but it is hard to build customer relationships when 1. you don't have customers and 2. they don't want to be bothered at all. I've learned that when everyone has an impossible quota to meet, it brings the ugly out of people. It made a very toxic work environment where everyone is angry and everyone for ""stealing their sales"". I'm not competitive and I definitely couldn't be bothered with all the drama, but I endured 16 months of coworkers complaining about other coworkers. Can't we all get along? At Dillard's? Nope. Management was also very inconsistent. I was taught not only to sell, but to clean up, to do markdowns, to rearrange merchandise accordingly, etc. However, everyone else hired after me were taught only to sell, which caused them to ask me a lot of questions about things they should have known from the beginning and they took my time away from my own work. The way I was instructed to do things within my job by a manager, only set me up for failure at the end. Dealing with people in general was the hardest part of the job, whether it be customers, coworkers, or managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding a way to put up new merchandise. I guess I'm just a very industrial worker."
good,Its hard to get sells because the trained their people to be sell sharks. If your not white it'll be hard to get sells because the customers are racist along with management.
good,"Cant really advance here i was there for a year and never got the chance to advance, you are required to work from open to close and it doesnt have any benefits as for as medical or anything else like that."
good,"it was a challenging environment to work within. unrealistic goals, no team to cheer for. often felt like a number without training to help me succeed"
good,"If you are looking for a job and have help at home, this job is for you. Other wise apply else where. If you do not have sales experience or not motivated everyday to engage with customers, it will be very hard to make sales goals."
good,Sometimes you would be responsible for working your department alone without relief. If you ask dept. manager a question she would take you to the store managers office. She would state that she did not think you wanted to work there. That was not the question at all.
good,Dillard's sets you up to fail at the job so they have a good excuse to fire you. They give you unrealistic expectations and the environment is very confrontational. I will never work there again
good,I had this job while I was in college. It pays well why you are still in school. It can be a little mundane and doesn't require much analytical thought. I would work here again for extra money and the discounts are great.
good,"Enjoyed working with peers. Working retail has its highs and lows, especially around the holidays.  My drawback was needing to work six days per week."
good,"don't agree with the daily quota, they will let anyone go if you don't meet your daily quota. not a job for older people for sure."
good,"I was so excited when I first started in the Luggage Department in the Corporate Home Buying Office.  I worked in Arlington, Texas where I received great benefits and prospered in a great working environment.  I did learn much about merchandising and marketing.  However, I was laid off after six months due to the Dillard's President and Board decision to move the Home Department to Little Rock, Arkansas. "
good,"retail technique was good, training was good, but the customer service care was terrible and needed much improvement. over stress of sales goal"
good,"Holidays and long hours and driver credit cards, Not family orientated. Management does not talk to associates like people. Sales goals are more important than your health."
good,"Management was not so great. The turnover rate was absurd, the goals and expectations were unrealistic. Management never helped in anything, & couldnt be depended on for nothing. There was no room for advancement in that company. The environment is very cut throat. Its like predator & prey. Overall it was ok, Cosmetics is fun if you know how to sell."
good,Dillard's has a goal system that is unfair to employees. If they do not reach a sales goal their pay is decreased. This continues until they are terminated. This creates a culture of back stabbing to meet goal and to keep employment. Customers feel overly smothered and makes for an overall difficult shopping experience for all.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees and how some of us could connect. The management at was ok could have been a little more organized for my taste but other wise fine. The hardest thing about the job was to stay motivated because I did not take much from the job such as learning new skills or bettering myself with experience. The job had very basic selling experience and the training was inadequate.
good,this job taught me to take ownership of something that was mine. i so i couldperform at my best and provide the best help possible. learned that dept and all the merchandise in
good,"Stocked shelves, helped customers with clothing choices, assisted customers in the dressing rooms. rang up purchases for customers. Most of the clientel were older women"
good,Assist managers to guarantee that daily client and corporate satisfaction objectives are monitored and fulfilled.Ensure that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment and maintaining solid product knowledge. Successfully demonstrates ability to work in a high volume fast paced retail environment
good,Typical work day was displaying new merchandise. Marking down items that went on sale. Management was ok. Co-workers were the best. We always found something to laugh about at work in the mist of drama. The hardest part was working when I was pregnant. I was sick to my stomach for the first 5 months. The most enjoyable part was the friends I made.
good,I would’ve like to learn more about customer service to improve my knowledge as well as help customers in specific situations. I feel there was not much support and personal growth in the position of customer service.
good,"Typical work day for me when I was employed at Dillard's was ok."
good,"Was unable to advance because my floor manager didn't want to ""lose me"" - this was after they told me I was being promoted to new position - moving from sales floor to accounting."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Dillard’s. The management was a bit problematic even through an outside perspective, but as a whole I really loved working for Dillard’s. My co-workers were amazing, the customers always put me in the best mood, I was always learning. I really enjoyed my time."
good,"This would be a great company to work for if the pay scale was different. First of all, each sales associate has a personal daily sales goal they ""must"" reach or it gets tacked onto the next day's goal making it even harder to reach. If you are lucky enough to make around 80% of your sales goal or higher you get a decent raise. However, lookout, because after you get that raise your sales goals increase making harder than ever to reach it unless you hound your clients to come in and buy buy buy. If you don't meet that daily sales goal you get a drop in pay... yes they take your raise away. It is like a bait and switch pay scale. Then on top of that horrible stress, you have associates from other departments watching your department like a hawk to see if they can steal a sale from you to make their own daily goals. It pits co-worker against a co-worker."
good,Dillard's has poor management with high standards for their sales associates. I personally truly enjoyed my job but with high sales goals and poor management the store was a disaster.
good,"Fire you when you don't make unrealistic sales goal. It is flexible with hours and they give decent hours, even for part timers, however if you slip for a month or two and cannot make the extremely high sales goals, you will get cut with no warning."
good,Expected you to work long hours from home every day and also come to work. Management is too involved in personal relationships with employees and stirs up drama. Management is also very rude.
good,Cundo hay personas que no aman lo que hacen desmotivan a los de su alrededor
good,"If you don't mind cut throat hustle, this is for you. Don't ever call out if you're sick, family emergency, death or personal, the company will make you feel terrible. They don't care how clean and neat your work space is, only how much you sell. Raises are based solely on sales and nothing else."
good,The pay is great but it's not worth being so unhappy. if you know anyone who personally works there they'll likely tell you themselves. if there was a new management team it would make a world of difference
good,"This is not a good place to work.  Customers are always stealing or complaining about you unfairly.  The managers usually try to put things on their employees just to have a reason to terminate you.  You are expected to sell 1000. dollars of merchandise daily even if customers don't come into the store due to weather constraints, or order online.  You don't always have control over your making your selling goals.  Also, employees are told that they have to get customers to apply for  Dillards's credit cards and even if the customer says No, they don't want to apply, management still expects you to get customers to apply for credit cards.  Many of my customers were on business trips when they came into store to purchase gifts.  Having a credit card was unnecessary when they lived out of the country and did not know when they would return again."
good,"Senior management at the Baton Rouge, LA Dillard's location will promise new managers salaries and bonuses that never really come to fruition."
good,"Extremely longs days at work all while being underappreciated by a corporate owner company. "
good,"So to start off, I liked the people that I worked with (most of them). They were often younger folks and there were a few older people there. My biggest problem with this place was the managers. They seemed more interested in promoting items that weren't strong sells to begin with, rather than finding ways to help their employees excel in the workplace. To top it off, a lot of the people there can be pretty cut-throat and try to steal your sales if you let them. I think the best example of how inefficient the managers were is that they would have morning meetings where they would get everyone to chant that we had the ""best customer care anywhere!"" which was total bogus. Instead of creating an environment where that was true, they just said it and hoped that it would come true."
good,"This is a great first job. You learn how to work in a fast pace- cut throat environment. "
good,El trabajo de atender a clientes y mantener tu area decente es facil. Hay momentos en los que es dificil ya que es un trabajo donde hay competencia entre empleados ya que todos deven cumplir con sus ventas.
good,"Great hours, great pay. Beautiful clothes. Very friendly store manager."
good,"Fun to work with people who are friendly. Can be fast paced during weekends and holiday seasons but overall the days seem to be pretty slow paced. Nice discount, decent pay, but not the best area/business managers in all the departments."
good,"A typical day was fast paced and busy."
good,Great place to work for entry level retail. Only benefits is really the discounts that you can receive on the products that they carry. Flexible hours and great people to work with.
good,"Dillards is a good place to work, the start pay is fair and the hours are flexible. The job itself is fairly easy and Dillard's offers positions that are commission based.  Though Dillard's the company is a good place to work, management in the stores are poor."
good,You have to be strong and willing to deal with two face co-workers and management. They like to talk and gossip about anything to anyone who listens. Sometimes felt embarrassed that these we're the kind of people to work with especially when it came from management. I chose to leave because it was not a healthy place to work. Oh and every body knows and talks about the GM for the store being a pervert.
good,This was a good part time starting job but it is very stressful and competitive to keep up with. There is bullying and favoritism shown and mangers don't work well with you.
good,"your aren't a person except when they need something from you, willingness to listen is very low from management team. A lot of promises when hired but not fulfilled."
good,"quotas are unreachable unless you are badgering customers via phone, text and email. co workers are not team mates they are competitors. And if a coworker is a bully, but makes more sales than you, they are justified. you and your feelings mean nothing, your job is to make sales or face their wrath."
good,Work isn't hard but your pay is depending on your sales. so every 6n months on review you can gain or lose your pay per hour and high pressure on selling credit cards.
good,"The customer are mostly amazing. Management gives you false hope and dreams. The pay is great, while the more you get paid the more you have to sell. The selling goal are extremely too high."
good,"The General Store Manager was not very good at management, they reduce your salary even though sales or slow and you miss goals. They do not value their employees as they let one woman go after working there for 33 years. When the higher ups come through they put on a dog and pony show then return to a sloppy sandwich once they are gone. Anyone they view as competent they will not promote you to fulltime, they only promote people who they feel are not good enough to challenge them for their job. Motivation level and management stinks."
good,good pay since paid weekly very high employee turnover and poor management who do not value employees. Lots of workplace bullies due to high sales quotas but slow customer volume.
good,very quiet workplace with very little customers. location is not very good considering there are not a lot of shopping customers on the weekday. only way you can make your quota is through saturday.
good,Working here is nice. You get to meet a lot of people working here and have a sense that your really helping your customers there in the shoe department. Management is always vey quick to help when needed. co workers are usually a lot of fun and are very easy to communicate with and work together where we can. Hardest part of the job is when your customer really wants something you don't have in stock or cant fit their individual foot type. Most fun is helping customers to find a shoe to go with a certain outfit.
good,"DOR is sales and direct customer service. "
good,"typical day, come into store,make sure your section is neat and presentable. Management were not that approachable.  Felt the management treated people differently."
good,its a good place to learn retail duties and planning . Visual merchandising and competitive selling. build up clientele and relationships.
good,Working at Dillard's for a year was a complete eye opener. I understand there is stress anywhere you go. the thing with Dillard's is that they do not understand that times are difficult with the oil being so low.
good,"I work in the Kiva Department."
good,"Cosmetics is a fast paced area of the department store. Days can be typically slow, weekends are busier. Sales quotas can be too high for the flow of traffic into the store. A lot of cold calling."
good,"Management is not the best. They don't always work with school scheduling or even other things such as family emergencies . Overall the pay is good, the scheduling of hours is not that great. It was an okay place to work overall but being in the medical field is my passion."
good,"Easy to get a job there"
good,"A typical day at Dillard's started with a morning meeting, with everyone from each department. We would go back to our respected areas to begin greeting and helping guests out. We would all check our emails to see what our days consisted of. We would check our daily goals and see what percentile we were in for the week. I cant lie and say this company is bad or doesn't work with their employees. I did meet so very great people here, the only thing is their management is awful. Their is a lot of favoritism being played there. The management would talk about other co-workers and put their personal business out there. Their organizational skills were completely off. Employees let their personal lives interfere with their work lives. The hardest part of my job was not being able to satisfy a guest (not having what they were looking for, not the right size, etc.)."
good,Dillards is an great place to work. It's easy to move up and succeed. They do not mind working around your schedule. The managers work with you to become better at your job.
good,"I love what I do, just wish the expectations and job flexability were more realistic.  The people I work with are hardworking and very goal oriented."
good,"The Upper Management is very rude and disrespectful. You will get screamed at (yes screamed at) in public, in front of staff, customers, and any passerbys. They set outrageous sales goals, threaten your job daily, if they do not like the numbers that you are producing. If  a staff member does not show for work for any reason you are held accountable and punished publicly."
good,"You have to be prepared that if you do not make your quota, your pay will be deducted or you will be terminated.  People are very uptight and management is poor.  This is the perfect company for someone who has no family.  They do not work well with schedules or family activities."
good,"My typical work day is not the type of job, I applied for with this company. Management seems to have a disconnect from employees."
good,"I was told that I would work 28 hours per week and would have a review at the end of January.  There was a chance that you could become permanent.  In January the hours were cut to 20 hours and there would no longer be anyone except part-time.  We were given a ""Quota"" to sell each day.  If there were no customers you had no way of reaching it, so you had no way of ever getting a raise."
good,"I tried tell management about an employee stealing merchandise and they don't care. they are all about signing people up for the Dillard's card, if you do meet qualification they will fire you. its good pay but not for everything you have to do and extensive training if you happen to be specializing in anything., NOT WORTH THE HASSLE and Time"
good,"My typical day would begin with checking emails (which I did at least three times a day). I after that I would go through various programs checking sales goals for the day, what the final numbers for the previous day was, check for markdowns in any departments and then usually look at a few job applicants. By this time the store would be opening. We all met downstairs for a morning meeting where any announcements about sales, markdowns, new employees, etc. would be made. Then myself and any other managers on duty would unlock the doors and greet waiting customers. After this I would do a floor walk of my departments and give daily sales goals and to do lists to my sales people. As the day went on I would assist with sales floor projects, unhappy customers, and employee issues. I learned how to successfully delegate assignments to employees and make sure they were completed in a timely manner as well as multitask very efficiently. This was very handy when running customers service. I also learned many computer programs and integrated new company programs into my daily duties. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. Most of the time there was so much to do, none of the managers left on time, or we were coming in early for closing shifts. This was very difficult with an infant son. The best part of the job was when I would approach a very unhappy customer and would  handle whatever issue they may be having. When they would leave with a smile on their face it was the best. Some would even hug me. The only other downside was the lack of support from the upper management."
good,fast past sales business.  If your sales were down you have have to find a way to get them up.
good,I have had many great experiences with Dillards.  A few challenges along the way and great personal reward in achieving my goals.
good,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. The management is awful this local Dillard's(There are a couple exceptions). I do admit that my immediate manager was the best manger I have ever had. She made her area associates want to strive for their best, just for her to be praised. Praises were scarce. The corporation as a whole is okay. They do have so outrageous expectations for some of the stores but, that is why they pay very well for retail."
good,I did really well in that department of cosmetics and wish I could Make more money since I am older now doing that.  I loved it You got to play with makeup and do makeovers all day.  I was really good at what I did though and was the top seller of my counter month after month
good,I didnt enjoy working at dilards. It was always a battlefield on the work floor over sales.
good,there was always a stress factor to be there along with the SPH and managers at that time they were out to be sharks to keep there job always something
good,Had a great work experence but the management was not on same page about things going on in the store.
good,"A typical day in dillards included organizing, cleaning, speaking with customers about future purchases, and meeting a daily sales quota. I learned to stay on top of my work and make sure to call previous customers and tell them about new products so that meeting the sales quota becomes easier. This was probably the worst management I have ever worked for. The coworkers were very overdramatic and did not know how to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people. The hardest part of my job was the long work hours leaving hardly any time for a home life. "
good,"Great people to work with and enjoyable customers. However, since the employees have to make a certain dollar amount per hour there is a high turnover rate."
good,"management was a huge joke, short breaks, pay wasnt enough for how many hours and projects had to be done, strict on everything, the good parts were the discount and first dibs on sale items and free makeup smaples"
good,I don't really care for the management staff at Dillard's. The managers treat you like your a number and not a person. A typical day at work consists of reaching sales goals and selling. The hardest part of the job is selling the required goal when the store is dead. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get to work with my friends.
good,Great place to have fun and learn about selling and cross selling to customers. Upper management came around a little to make changes to the floor which had to be completed I guess more of a critique. My co-workers were great and thats what would get you through most days they are the bread and butter of the business. I would say the hardest part of the job was being torn in different directions which would in turn put my agenda of work off. I enjoyed working with people helping employees and most of alll helping the customers
good,I liked working at Dillard's but it get frustrating
good,"Employee salaries are tied to sales per hour. Can be tough making your goal when customer flow is low. The economy being on the downside is a huge problem. If you don't make your SPH...your salary is lowered and you loose store discount.....end cause is hostile co workers....when they dont make SPH. Work hours are not consistant, time off is impossible to get if the schedule has been made....be prepared to miss family events...weddings,funerals,kids sports games, and holiday time with family. Very conpetitive enviorment/stressful."
good,Working for Dillard's gave me a lot of experience on how products are displayed and how important building clientele is. There always changing and moving top selling products around which is always up to the sales associate to set up. They also have a base pay even though you still have sales goals that can get you demoted or fired if you don't keep them up to a certain level.
good,"Dillard's has a competitive pay scale, however to maintain the hourly rate one must have a certain amount of sales or that salary will be cut. In some areas the weekly is not a fair representation and it's hard to ask for days off."
good,"If you like working in a clique, this is the place for you. Once you're not a favorite they will start a paper trail to get you out the door regardless of performance."
good,This company pays its employees well but its not for nothing. The management can be cruel to its workers and often forget that you are a human being. There's very little room for advancement and communication is poor.
good,"This job allows me to utilized most of my skills which I have acquired over the past years in regards to Retail, Merchandising, Human Resources, Coaching and Business Analysis. The hardest part of the job is work-life balance. as we are required to work 6 days a week for the entire year. The management of sales staff requires deep levels of coaching so that the associate thrives and develops a strong career either in sales or pursuit of a management track. The most enjoyable part of the job is the building of a management team as we take on many challenges as a unit and thrive in our environment using our creativity, customer service and goal setting skills to take us to the next level of success & productivity."
good,"I enjoyed working with coworkers,  meeting  and greeting  clients.  I didn't  like that the  company has a bad turn over  problem and they often do pay cuts."
good,No work life balance.  Working weekends was mandatory.  Only positive is the amazing discount they offered.  Customers were good.  Executive management team consistantly micromanaged all employees.
good,"Worked here for two years. "
good,"I worked for Dillard's.many years. You make your sales or receive a pay cut. 10% comes off of your hourly pay. You get a pay raise then you sell more per hour. I saw a few employees have to sell $220.00 per hour. No commission. Only ladies shoes are on commission. Poor ladies shoes."
good,"You have a quota, mine was two thousand i had to make a day and where this dillards was located you never met your goal & that leads to getting fired."
good,"Dillards likes to pit associates against each other thinking it will result in better customer service. It results in the customers feeling like a piece of meat thrown into a piranha pool. You are required to request days off 2 months in advance and you are almost guaranteed not to have your requested days. It is almost impossible to schedule doctor appointments, etc.-plus management reserves the right to change your schedule at any moment at their discretion. This is not about emergencies, it is about management not taking into account holidays and sales days that they know about up to a year in advance. They seem to purposely make the job more difficult than it has to be. Pay and benefits are pretty good but it is almost impossible to maintain your pay level in such a competitive atmosphere. Also, there is a mountain of stock maintenance, markdowns, and general busy work that must be done in addition to customer service. Smart associates ignore this work and spend their time chasing down customers. In addition, even if you show every day at your scheduled time and do a stellar job on maintaining sales floor conditions, none of this helps when review time comes around. I was there more than 20 years and really enjoyed the customers and the work, but in the end, this is soul crushing work."
good,I would not recommend this job to people with children. This job does give you a set schedule as well as you are not able to plan your life around your schedule due to your schedule being fed to you week to week. I have had to cancel many appointment for myself and well as my children. As a sales associate you are given a daily quota and there are times where there are no customers/ slow days that you are unable to meet these goal and they are at liberty to fire you for not meeting these goals. Management is not the best at training you when you excel to a hire position and they expect you to know things that you have not been trained on. I don't agree with how they run this company.
good,Micromanagement. That all I have. Want to learn more but was not able to. So I went and learn on my own at a Taylor shop. After I the Taylor class I had taken I was able to do my job.
good,"Get out while you can, they will eat your soul.  The management has a high school mentality,  all are a bunch of bullies.  SPH is out dated is unreasonable."
good,"Pretty boring place to work.  You were given sales goals which were rarely followed up on.  The training was non-existent both on sales techniques and product knowledge.  Also,"
good,The Dillards in St. George Utah is the only place to shop for high end luxury goods in the area. The management is more focused on selling and keeping the numbers good. Some times employees get left behind in the fact that management is cold and will not respond to certain demands of work life balance.
good,"The work was fine. However, there are many people there that will not treat you right or fairly. The goals that come from corporate put too much pressure on everyone and then everyone started treating each other poorly."
good,"Dillards offers good salary for their sales positions... but the departmental culture is cut-throat due to unreachable sales goals, unless there is a sale. If you do not make your goals your salary will be cut.Traffic is erratic at best. Managers will need you to work on Merchandising projects and take you away from getting your sales. Extremely micro-managed, yet very little communication. You're caught between a rock and a hard place daily. So sad..."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at Dillard's. The standard the company sets of selling enough merchandise in commission to earn my monthly wage killed my opportunities of continued employment with this organization. I fell behind in the commission I should have been earning so I was terminated. To be fair, I was warned in writing several times about being behind in production of my commission standard. The problem with that standard is, I could not complete enough sales to overcome my commission deficit."
good,the hardest part of the job is making the sales because the are too high and if you don't make it you will get a pay cut. I learned a lot of visual merchandise.
good,"Management needs work and people need to be held accountable of their actions. Sales associates need to work together and be rated on how effective they do their whole job, not just selling."
good,this job is so backward. from the management to the people working there. everything is just in shambles. we cant even go over 30 hours a wek at this location
good,"Make sure store presentable before store opens."
good,"Dillards is a good company, they pay well and try to give as much training as necessary for the position.  Issues with company culture arose, and the competitive nature can push people to the edge."
good,"Working with the associates at Dillards' was great, but you get no opportunity to move up. You can work there for years without any type of raise. It is done purposely through competitive cut-throat quotas. The company is very, very, very traditional. If you are a particular person the company is not suited for you."
good,"The cosmetics manager was petty and showed obvious favoritism towards certain cosmetics counters obvious dislike towards certain people for no particular reason. She heard a management philosophy she expressed to all of us that read, ""coach them up or coach them out."" The site manager was the same, but showed verbal aggressiveness and fostered a hostile work environment. She also had a bad corporate visit and decided to fire and replace everyone with any kind of experience right before the holidays."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment. There are chances to advance in the company, but no guarantees. The pay is good- it is based on quotas and performance standards that must be met."
good,"Dillards is a alright place to work. It has its ups and downs, which I'm sure every company does. The Dillards management could use some work. Half the time they are very unprofessional."
good,Started off without a manager and then it went down hill from there. Having to make numbers every day when it’s dead was hard. Slightly impossible when you work in a dead area for clothing
good,"I enjoyed working there when i was first hired, the managers then cared about us.  The ones there now don't care about anyone but themselves.  I hope that they get it together they have a high turnover rate of people leaving there company."
good,"Provide varieties of services, from helping customers pick out items of their needs to processing transactions by cash, check, or gift card. Most enjoyable part of job would be interacting with customers."
good,"Everyone must meet a daily quota and if you don't you are out the door.  People will do anything they have to in order make their daily quota.  Including lie, steal customers and I even had my department manager at tell me at the end of every month I could not ring sales under my associate number because she needed to make her bonus.  This job literally made me sick and very stressed out.  After 5 years I had to leave."
good,"A typical workday includes being a personal shopper, ensure the department is clean and well kept and working with others to meet department quotas. management depends on the store"
good,"It is very hard to become full time, the sales goals are rediclous, the people were nice to work with. and the sales were awsome. All in all it was a nice place to work."
good,Dillard's pays well but is not an organized company. Advancement opportunity is available but scarce. Dillard's requires you to start as part time and earn full time.
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to make people buy stuff just to make my quota. I don’t think that’s fair we can’t force people to buy something
good,"Everyday was a competition of who got the most sales."
good,"Working at Dillard's you need  to understand that the company only cares about sales. You're expected to sell and meet your target sales quota despite store traffic or season. If you do not meet your target sales quota you are at risk of receiving a pay cut or getting fired no matter how long you have been with the company or how great of an employee you are. Dillard's is a company concerned with numbers and numbers only. A typical day of work would be competing for sales with your coworkers and soliciting credit to customers for the company's gain. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining your sales quota on top of maintaining the workplace (hand-ringing markdowns, putting out stock, organization etc.). The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you'll create with your coworkers. Dillard's has an amazing staff that does their best in every situation."
good,Management Wasnt chosen very wisely. Posssibly could've payed more attention to their workers. training was very minimal for new workers. Managers rarely came to talk to workers.
good,"As far as the job and the requirements on doing a job was fun, but with the way you are paid, you have to take sales from other employees to keep your rate of pay or to get a raise. so your pay can go up and down. if you are working a slow department and during a slow time you will loose most of your pay.  If you do not make the sales quota then your job is terminated regardless of your performance."
good,Selling apparel to walk in customers can become boring during slack hours. Perform display recovery and stocking during slack time. Management have merchandising backgrounds with minimal organizational skills.
good,The department itself is beautiful but management and the enviroment of the store as a whole is not very welcoming. Management seemed to encourage shark like behavior from the associates.
good,I liked the pay and I tried my best to keep the job even though there were other competitive co-workers in the same department as me  however I got terminated by not making enough sales.
good,this job is his pressure sales. the people are work with are amazing and i work with a great team. its hard to balance and family and work life being a  single mom. its typical retail if yo lie that sort of environment.  i have been doing it to long its time for a change. i don't haven compliments just need a career change.
good,Unachievable sales goals set for associates.  Raises are solely based on Sales Increases despite not having the control of inventory levels or the associates that are hired to work in your department.
good,"Working for Dillard's lets you look at fashion up close and you must like people."
good,"Sometimes management will remain consistent, but sometimes a sweater is suddenly a long sleeve top. The floor arrangement is in a constant state of flux. People will ask you where things are and you may not know where it is, because there was a floor move yet again. "
good,"A typical day at work might have included marking merchandise down for sale,marking and measuring customers for clothing,assisting customers with selections of clothing,maintaining department standards."
good,Very stagnant environment. Not much room for advancement unless you are rubbing elbow with the right people. The pay is minimum. Too many sales to see the benefit of commission. I enjoyed going to work mostly for my customers and to get my bills paid.
good,There was a lot of broken promises when I worked there. Depending on your department its stressful to keep up with your sales quota. People are very competitive over numbers.
good,"You do way too much and deal with way too many rude customers to be treated the way you do here and it’s a lot of walking, being on your feet all day (you can’t sit) for little pay"
good,Providing great customer service. Products are high quality. Store manager is not supportive and a bully. Workplace culture is very competitive and quota driven. Quotas are unreasonable. You are only valued if you meet quotas.  The hardest part of the day is being on your feet for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part is helping customers select merchandise.
good,"Working in the Cosmetics department at Dillard's is probably the worst. There are hardly ever any customers and associates need to meet their daily quota before their review or they're fired, but you can't meet your numbers if there's no one there to buy. Recruiting new clients works probably 2 times out of 20."
good,"managers were not helpful , they were not there to help better there associates nor did they care. women were fighting for sales and having nasty attitudes."
good,I worked there in sales.  Takes a lot of flexibility to work in sales.  This would be a great job for a college student or someone just getting out there.
good,First time I worked in sales but did not like the compensation program. If sales weren't there you would lose money. So on a slow day the work environment was very hostile.
good,I personally do not care for it due to the environment. It is always stressful. They tell you to do one thing but expect something totally different. People are not treated the same.
good,A typical day is pretty boring unless an event or counter is in gift. A lot of people use Sephora or Ulta instead. You have to deal with management getting on you all the time. Not worth the mental and emotional stress
good,My daily task is to get the counter ready for the day and get goals done daily to ensure our daily goals are made.Manage my employee to ensure she has product knowledge and knows her goal for the day.
good,"Walk into work and immediately start your day with competitiveness, meet monthly quotas, and depending on the department it can be cut-throat. Best part"
good,The pay compensation is great. However what the trade off for this is horrible management and a stressful and unrealistic sales goal. When you have a question or answer for helping grow the business they look at you like your stupid. So if you are looking for a place that you don't even want to communicate with your managers and be looked down upon but make decent money this is the place for you.
good,Sometimes employees with 25 years with the company are terminated because they are short of sales goals. Often not fault of employees. Many laid off when Westgate store closed.
good,Learned a lot about dealing with people.  There was the unfair sales quota for each day to meet.  I enjoyed answering the switch board. I enjoyed merchandising the clothes.  I did not get enough hours there so I did not stay
good,a typical day at dillards would be clocking in and taking care of customers and customer problems. I've learned to build strong relationships with my customers to build trust with them. I have also became a certified fitter. the management is not that great they don't seem to care about their employees much at all.
good,"Dillards is like most typical large chain stores, a sales person is just that, they aren't very personal and generally as long as you meet goals that's all that matters. They often seemed short staffed on managers, or the managers were over worked. Associates were expected to deal with things until someone came along to help a situation."
good,It was an okay job. Upper management was very rude. If you asked for a day off they wouldn't let you have the day off or if requested more hours. Overall experience was okay.
good,The company gave me the opportunity to overcome my fear of being shy and now I can provide customer service to every person that comes in the store with a workplace that has a very calm environment.
good,"The work environment between staff was horrible, The (SPH) Sales Per Hour was so high of a goal professionalism and care for the customer was lost."
good,"As a Visual Manager at Dillard’s my primary responsibility was to make sure the store’s presentation was being properly maintained I frequently monitored the completion of the monthly display directives each department was assigned. As a liaison between the store"
good,It was impossible to reach inflated sales goals due to the store having part timers with no stock duties or areas to take care of.Full timers had areas to maintain and put out stock for whereas part timers did not.
good,"Dillard's was an ok place to work. You can be micromanaged at times, but usually are allowed a high degree of autonomy. The work is tedious, and job satisfaction is not very high."
good,Working with Sales Staff and management often presented challenges due to the competitive nature of the business.  The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time when client interaction was very low.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to assist client shoppers find the items they were looking for and enhance their overall shopping experience.
good,lots of calling customer and makeovers. Its lots of work but if you put the time in it will pay off. There are training you get to attend that provide you with lots of makeup skills.You get to participate in fun evens the store has year around. Despite it being retail i will say i have made wonderful friends while working there as well as become acquainted this lost of wonderful people.
good,they expect a lot out of you. more than you are paid to do. the people are awesome. you learn a lot and grow. hardest thing is dealing with management. I love helping customers.
good,Upper management is difficult to work for and the pay is not competitive with other companies when it comes to salaried associates.  Benefits are not great and incentives are not good and very few.
good,"Dilards was a nice company to work for, however, hours and days off arent as honoured. They have good beenfits, and gratis awards avaliable."
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers with their shopping needs, measurements, and keeping the store presentable. This job has taught me a lot about customer service and how to prevent conflict in the work place. I cannot speak for all Dillard's locations, but for mine, management left a lot to be desired. Co-workers are great and are the reason why many people continue to work there. The hardest part of the job is learning how to deal with unhappy customers in a professional way. Also, making your sales per hour is not always an easy task. The most enjoyable part of this job is definitely the co-workers, they make going to work a good experience."
good,"I enjoyed working with my customers that came into my department. Majority of the time my clients leave the store very satisfied, my customers use to come back and asked for me to help them instead of another associate in the department."
good,"Sales performance based so it is hard if someone cannot make sales. Each day if someone comes in before 5 pm, they have to scan all the merchandise that is going to get marked down. Putting new merchandise out while changing mannequins while responding to customers questions and answering phones. This job is all about developing clientele and keeping sales."
good,"What I learned from retail in general is it taught me to be compassionate towards others, always apologize when a mistake is made, attention to detail(displays,walls),know when to figure out stuff on your own and to ask for help,make the most out of your time, and just smile."
good,"Work with drugged up employees, management has NO communication skills, job duties are easy, nothing will ever change in your job, reviews are meaningless and never expect a raise."
good,a typical day of work means that you have to clean up your department and try to sell people your products. The overall management staff is not understanding at all when it comes to your schedule or requested time off. The hardest part of the job is to keep your sales quota up. The worst part is that you are forced to go against your co-workers. They do not want you to look out for one another but just to make the company money.
good,Working for Dillard's was a great learning experience. I have obtained many important work skills and management skills. Although being salary usually called for long work hours being in such a exciting work environment made time fly. There was a large part of my job that was challenging and called for a great deal of innovative an exciting ways of capturing buyers. All together there was an even scale of both managing of the company and interacting with both associate's an customers.
good,If you love quotas and Sales this is the company to work for. They start you out at a great pay rate but watch out!!!  If you don't make your sales goal quarterly or monthly they will decrease your pay and give you only 2 more chances or you are gone.
good,Took care of customers needs and built a clientele of return customers.  Displayed new merchandise for better sales. Met the desired Quota for the day and made No.1 in sales many times.
good,I enjoyed working with co-workers. Being in retail sales your pay is based on your sales. You must make monthly quotas to obtain pay increase.
good,"The management was awful, they could never decide how much per minute we should get paid per product packaged. When there wasn't a big sale work is slow and at times no work to be done except to clean floors tile time to go home."
good,I was very lucky to have worked under a wonderful store manager that taught me a lot about the business.  He made it worth it.
good,I was working here while in college and playing college golf on a scholarship and I gave my manager my days I needed off to play in tourmaments for my scholarship and I was given off 1 out of 8 days I needed off to play.
good,Company could perform better with mature management.  Working hours are better than other retail establishments.
good,Great discounts but terrible management. Managers were not always nice but the environment was clean and safe.
good,"all day busy, but the bad part is make sales goals with the present economy."
good,Dillard's is an okay place to work. The pay is good and I get along with my co-workers. The main problem we all have is the quota system that Dillard's has and the fact that they want us to '5 star sell' and we don't get full credit outside of our own departments. My store is also poorly managed.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillards. However, no matter how much effort you put into your work, if you do not meet your sales quota, you will be terminated, no if ands or buts about it."
good,Job was very interesting.  Each day was different.  Co-workers were great!
good,"I love my co-workers, dillards is a great work place for students who are seeking part time only job."
good,"A typical day at work is receiving and putting away new merchandise. Organizing, colorizing, and sizing merchandise on the shelves. Executing the customer's request in a friendly fashion. Selling Dillard's Credit Applications and clothes. You're always doing something that is making the floor look better. Whether it would be putting away clothes, changing mannequins, folding clothes, looking for customers to sell to, or even dusting! They always say there is always something to do at Dillard's!"
good,"A typical day at work is like night and day. Some days its busy, other days there's nothing to do. And with being back in Customer Service and most of the time being by yourself, there's no leaving. Co-workers are GREAT. I have a wonderful relationship with who I work with. Management isn't much help. I feel like there is a lot of favoritism. In the past 5 months we have lost 5 managers. So I see that as a problem."
good,Everyday is different because general defining of position.
good,"Open the register, use excellent customer service, merchandise new and old product, fight for your sales."
good,"A Typical day at Dillard's as a sales representative  is like most retail settings. I had to give great customer service to every customer, maintain my department's appearance and use selling techniques to boost sales. I learned effective selling technique's by taking selling classes and seminars. My manager was really not that involved and made it hard to communicate with her daily. My co-workers were all sales driven people and polite to everyone. The hardest part of my job was communication with my manager. She would only address associates with problems and complaints and never had anything positive to say. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers."
good,"Co-workers and management were wonderful, but corporate did not foster a positive working relationship and job security and recognition are non-existent.  Co-workers and  customers were the only positive part of the job."
good,"work environment is great pay is ok, hours are low. Management staff should communicate to staff more often."
good,"In a typical work day, I was expected to sell a certain dollar amount an hour while maintaining the cleanliness of the sales floor and customer service. I learned merchandise information in numerous areas such as women's clothing, accessories, and fragrances. However, it was hard to meet my sales quota being moved around so much. For the most part, management was alright. Do not expect them to help if your numbers start falling though. They do not seem to care about their employees. Most co-workers are very aggressive with sales. Very few are friendly. Hours are never constant and there is hardly any job stability."
good,Management wasn't the best! Alot of bumps in the road to claiming up the ladder. Wasnt the best work environment for myself.
good,"hardest part of the job is trying to work the system. "
good,Learned discipline and working well with others in a competitive sales environment.
good,"it is a routine work day nothing exciting and new, learned a lot of new cosmetics products, they have a very poor management system, I loved my co-workers, the hardest part is standing all day with just a lunch break, the most enjoyable part is getting to know the customers and making sure that they are happy with the service.    "
good,The best part of the job were relatioships with co-workers.  The worst part of the job was the schedule.
good,Receive assignments and contact store to investigate the claim and determine if follow-up contact is needed with the customer. I have learned to balance work and home and to keep that separated. The co-workers were an incentive for working for Dillard's.
good,"I enjoyed working in customer service very much. The people were fun and friendly and the occassional angry customer was taken care of by an area sales manager for the most part. Had they left me in customer service, I would probably still be there today. I learned how to multi-task and how to wrap a gorgeous present! I was given a lot of responsibility both at the McCain location and even more at the Park Plaza location a few years earlier. I was responsible for a lot of money and handled it with ease."
good,I loved helping customers and the people I worked with. The expectations they wanted are crazy how can anyone make money when the store has no customers. The management was alway harassing me I felt like i was always being watched and yet I had customers come back just because i was a great help!
good,"Though this is true, I found the people pleasant to work with."
good,"Good pay, but hard company to work for. No regard to family life."
good,"I work hard keeping up my area and constantly changing walls and mannequins to display the newest products. I have learned how to better talk to people but still have trouble making my sales. The hardest part of the job is keeping up your sales esp. if you work for a slow store. What makes it even harder to keep your sales up is the fact that returns count against you and so do the perks like the 10% off shopping passes that the customer earns. For Dillard's sales is the most important thing and if you don't keep them up you will get your hours cut, then your pay, and then you are terminated."
good,"I worked 50-55 hours a week, several nights and weekends. As a manager we have to make sure that the store gets opened and closed daily. I manageged 17 associates. I made monthly schedules. I was responsible for price changes, inventory control, merchandising, training, coaching, customer service and every aspect with day to day business."
good,"Very cut throat enviroment no one seems to get along always having issues, we never see the asst. manager when needed or if we do they tell us it's ok and walk off"
good,"A typical day would consist of ring up customers at the point-of -sale register, mark downs, recovery, having the proper knowledge of the sales item, while fostering a positive work environment."
good,bad managment no one really had good direction. the hardest part of this job was trying to help everyone get organized anday on the right parth to keeping my work in order
good,Associate and management do not get along when it comes to been productive. The hardest part is to keep your productive up when there's no work and the Associate percentage goes down which is a bearing on their pay for the week. The most enjojable part is woring four days off three.
good,"Contradictory management styles. Discontent among the personnel, but relationships are good."
good,work that pays the bill
good,Ok for retail. But if you don't make your SPH(sales per hour) you will lose money. When it's time for your review and your SPH is down so is your money. As much as $1.00 less. It does not matter that there are very few customers in the store. Sale Sale Sale!!!!!!!!
good,The managers there need to learn a few thing!!! I enjoy working with the customer!!
good,I enjoyed my co-workers. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them.
good,"Application and interview process went smoothly and training was reasonable time frame. Dillards offers good pay for retail, based on monthly sales quotas."
good,"Life doesn't always work around the premade schedule done a month and a half in advance and changed numerous times, sometimes with no warning. The demand for new credit applications and the threats that follow are unrealistic."
good,If you are a manager Dillard's expects you to give up your home life for your job. You are threatened with termination every month if your department does not make it sales or credit card goals. The store manager has between four and six meetings daily with department managers making it difficult to get anything completed during the day.
good,Until i was being harassed by another employee . i reported it. They did nothing to the male employee who was harassing me stop.  Several times . asked to change. Schedule theyDid not.
good,"Distribution of tasks is unpredictable, but everyone will have a sales goal except for department managers, so tasks can sometime take precedent with them. BUT YOU HAVE TO SELL!"
good,"enjoyed working at Dillards; however, was a bit stressful because had a quota had to meet to get raises.  Enjoyed the visual merchandising much more than the selling aspect."
good,"I began working at Dillard's during college, it was great at the beginning with getting a reasonable amount of hours within each week. After the past holiday season, I have been downgraded to less than 20 hours a week and barely any communication with my manager to figure out how I can change this and get more hours. Also with getting so low of hours, I have a smaller chance to get a raise and my discount taken away"
good,"La empresa exige demasiado al empleado, sin otorgarle los incentivos necesarios para que el empleado trabaje sin tanta presión, es injusto lo que se le pide de resultados constantemente."
good,The location I worked at was fairly slow. Except during sales when everything was chaotic. Short staff and it’s hard to get things done because they only want you to focus on sales. And then got mad when things weren’t clean and organized. The job is competitive. I’ve heard of people being fired because the sales goals weren’t meant but I never saw it happen. Corporate was a pain. Getting days off was a pain. The only decent thing was the pay but there’s hardly a chance to move up. And the discount but they get you with that as well. You have to get a credit card or a prepaid card.
good,Work/Life is very unbalanced in retail. Schedule changed each week and never had set days off.  If you are good at selling you can make money but certain months are worse than others.
good,This was a interesting place to work. They had sales goals that were very hard to maintain. Very fast paced job. I enjoyed the many incentives offered by the company
good,Dillards although gave me the opportunity to attend school twice a week didn't live up to many standards. There is opportunity to grow in the company when your numbers are met. Management is all over the place and associates are constantly uneducated on technical knowledge. The schooling on Dillards Point Of Sale system was vague and constantly questioned.
good,Everything depends on which location you work at. From store managers. Ops managers to department managers. Each location is ran differently even though you would thinks as far as customer goes it should be the same at each store. There are department managers that should not be in their positions. Same with store managers. Can be fun but you do have to watch your back when it comes to management. Never thought I would have to and I was wrong. Learned the hard way.
good,"Overall I loved my job. My day started out checking my computer for messages and doing my office job. Then I gave team members a break. Took my break and worked rest of day on the sales floor. I learned how to do scheduling, loss control, inventory, stocking , rotation and inventory. I enjoyed working with the public and team members. The hardest part was upper management not wanting me to do what corporate would come through and advise me to do with set up on my floor."
good,We are sales associates that are given daily quotas and sales goals. We are evaluated on opening credit cards for consumers as well as getting the consumer to use their store brand credit cards.
good,Daily sales goals set by corporate. Eventually you would get a paycut if you did not make your goals. Nice merchandise and employee discounts. Good starting payrate but difficult to keep because of impossible sales goals
good,Very good hours. Managers didn't really know how to work with your personal life schedule. But good pay. Amazing co-workers. Helped a lot with teaching you a few tricks while working with the company.
good,"The pay is better than most basic retail jobs. But the management at The Sooner Mall Dillard's is just god awful. If you don't make your sales, they will fire you."
good,"Ridiculous hours, changing shifts without notice, and expectations that are impossible to hit? No thanks. I had days where I was scheduled to work open to close, sometimes 2 or 3 days in a row. I went out of town on my days off only to come back and clock in to be told I wasn't actually scheduled to work that day because my schedule had been changed without my notification. You're only able to check your schedule while you're at work, they don't email or call when they change it around, and you're penalized because of it. If you don't open enough credit cards with customers, you have to come in for extra training and it ruins your numbers even."
good,"I was put in the men's suit section and I didn't receive any training on that area.  Because we received commission on our sales, other employees would take your customers.  I was only part-time, so I didn't need to make the sales.  The full-time employees were not so nice."
good,Sales quotas are hard to meet and management is going downhill but if you can sell well than it’s a pretty good job. Sales associates are very cut throat to get sales and will push you out of the way.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and helping customers. The pay was really good but there is a sales quota that you have to make everyday. The sales quota determine if you get a raise or a pay cut.
good,"Like any sales job, people are cut-throat. You'll always be on the look out for new customers and always be watching out for coworkers will steal your customers."
good,There was no room for advancement. We never got raises. There was alot of work for not enough pay. It was a very fast paced job. You had to do the work of 3 people.
good,"I have to say, i was a  a team player associate at Dillards through thick and thin.  I was in the cosy hairs because i new the task and that the store was failing due to the location.  I outlasted upper management and was not bitter.  The location moved, and i still had a loyal base for customers.  I can honestly say, I was respected by the individual whom shopped with me.  They where treated like family and not steered towards a direction that did not fit their needs.     I  always gave i lave a level of service with my clients that was totally genuine.  It would be what I would want to receive."
good,"Its a wonderful place to work in the first few months, but the intense sales first mentality is not for everyone so there is an extremely high turnover rate since not everyone makes sales"
good,It can be a fun job but in the one area that is commission based it can be extremely stressful and the manager and certain staff members make it a hard place to stay positive.
good,A great place to work. A lot of fun. It is a very busy pace. If you stay with customers you can do well. If you talk to other associates all the time you will not.
good,as a sales associate I spent all day walking around engaging with customers for prospective sales.  My co workers could be very petty in their competition for customers.
good,The pay structure was set up that if you didn't make a certain amount of sales per hour you would loose hourly pay.  The goals were unrealistic and created a negative work environment.
good,"I worked part time. They kept cutting employee's hours. They are very understaffed now. Most employees were fun to work with, cosmetics can be very rewarding. Christmas hiring is now."
good,Enjoyed working with the customers.  Harder to work with the counter manager because of the sales per hour required and her aggressive moves to get to the customer first.
good,"just gonna say this. The Company okay , but it could improve on the pay. The Management could do a little better. There needs to more Teamwork. The company failing in the area of no real true leadership."
good,"I did not work on the sales floor, but ran the  regional alterations dept. originally servicing 10 locations.  I had a very  independent role and enjoyed my responsibilities and position very much."
good,"It was a decent place to work, good job at the time when I moved to Tennessee. Nice people to talk and work with. Sometimes people from different depts. would unload their troubles to me, and I felt like a licensed Psychiatrist."
good,Had a great Dept. Manager. I learned more about China and Crystal than I ever thought possible. We helped each other with duties like sales and restocking. Enjoyed being able to use our creativity. Hardest part was being told the store was closing.
good,"clean and check work area maintain goals and quotas. suggestive selling.management was poor and unfair. culture depended on staff, some were highly cut throat some staff were fair the culture was very diverse .management tended to have particular favorites. hardest part was when management sent some staff in back to stock for hours and expect to also maintain hourly quota.the most enjoyable was customers"
good,...then a sales rush brings lots of people and it is up to the sales persons to try and catch as many as they can. There is none to little help between coworkers because the management creates an atmosphere of cut-throat selling. Those who do not sell enough to meet their impossibly high quota is fired. There is a lot of employee turnover.
good,It was some typical days to where it was hard but sometimes it was good days and I have learned that the customer is always right and what do whatever it takes to make the customer happy especially when it comes to their merchandise.
good,Working for Dillards is very stressful. They have what is called sph ( sales per hour) the quota has to be met or you either take a pay cut or you are terminated. The work environment is not friendly because of the sph. But the pay is much better than other department stores.
good,The management is awful. No room for advancement and sales goals are set to high for anybody to achieve. Special treatment is shown to favorite employees.
good,"Love the discount and pay but very competitive workplace, very cut throat at times and can get very stressful. Expect no outside life if you're full time!"
good,You are given a sales goal for your review period. If you meet this goal you get a raise based on how much you exceeded the goal. However if you don't meet the goal they lower your pay.
good,Counter drawers straighten racks clean dressing rooms help customers ring sale  do markdowns  price changing and changing  signs merchandising colorizing.
good,Not very productive and there seems to be a lot of negativity from co-workers. We are busy during the daytime but after noon we are very slow and boring.
good,"Depending the area/dept you see basically the same customers."
good,"typically management or company does not care about employees . sph breaks moral of most associates, and the high focus of sales makes it hard for other  task that are demanded"
good,Management does not communicate and I have no job advancement opportunities. I feel as if the company only focuses on the sales and loses sight of their employees.  I know sales are important but they are losing the morale of their employees in the way they are treated. I disagree with that.
good,A typical day at work is coming on to the sales floor and immediately trying to meet your daily quota for the day. When you are first hired they do not do a very good job at explaining the pay/commission.
good,"Overall this is an okay place to work. You get nice pay but it's sales based. The managers aren't the nicest but some of them are. Working with the customers and merchandise is also good. However, the atmosphere is really competitive."
good,Its a great place to shop but to work well is a whole other subject. Sales Associates will steal customers and therefore your sales reflect. If customers return items it goes against you.
good,At first job was fun and all but then management did not really acted like they cared about you. All they care about is themselves and the company. Dont think i woul dgo back.
good,I find Dillards not so enjoyable to work as every employee has a sales target or quota everyday. Your obliged to sale more and get a credit application each in every customers you encounter. This will be the basis of your salary increase after 3 months and if you don't reach your target before your review they will ask you to voluntary resign which is unfair to those who really did there best for the company. I've learned a lot when it comes to customer service even though the management are not really as helpful but i enjoyed meeting different people making new friends.
good,This would be a good company to work for if they weren't always firing and hiring or didn't have sales goals in the first place. Nobody in my department has been there longer than a year.
good,"Dillards was a very boring job . It has good pay for starting off but its very boring and repetitive work. I hated doing the dressing rooms , to clean them and then do it again."
good,"putting out shipment, opening and closing register, straightening, cleaning, doing displays, assisting customers w/ clothing choices. learned about retail. management at the time they were not involved a lot of shady things going on w/ merchandise. this job was not very hard pretty chill."
good,You must be confident in yourself to succeed. I have learned that you can not allow the issues of life to interrupt your time at work. The customer is the most important person in any situation.
good,Dillard's was not the greatest place to work at. Every day I had the stress of meeting a sales goal because that would depend on wether or not I would still have a job there.
good,"The job its self is great. Customers are usually very friendly and easy to work with. there  is a lot of frequent customers. the management, ay this location, was not the best. sometimes very unprofessional and had favorites and were sometimes rude to their employees."
good,"Most of the time it isn't bad other than some rude customers. You get started at a high pay rate, but the higher the rate the more you have to sell. If you don't sell enough you get a pay cut, or get fired."
good,"Very disorganized, management is rude to sales representatives, pay is minimal. This company does not follow doctors orders while pregnant."
good,I did like working at Dillard's; However the quotas set upon new sales associates are nearly impossible to reach. It takes time to build a relationship with customers so that they keep coming back to shop with you. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about the new products available and bringing my knowledge to the sales floor to share with my customers.
good,"It's a nice place to work if you have no other option. The management staff is okay, but as far as getting a raise is out the question. The employees there is friendly and they all will help you in anyway they can. there's a nice friendly environment and we all seem like family.."
good,"Dillard's is a stable business which is concerned with high sales goals. Hardest part of the job was the slow traffic, and waiting hours for customers. Management was very nice. Some coworkers were very refreshing and keep the store positive. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with what customers we had."
good,"This was a part time job just for awhile. Lovely people but not my thing. Met interesting customers as they were traveling in the US."
good,"Potential to be fun work enviroment, ruined by managers who only care about numbers. Learned a lot of skills that could benefit me with other careers. Hardest part of job was dealing with management."
good,"Pay is great, chances to make more money and prizes but the job security is not there .I have learned to sell to customers. The management is poor. The hardest part about this job is that you have to make your quota daily even in slow months. The most enjoyable part about this job is that you meet all different type of people and get to dress up during events."
good,"Based on commission and just helping customer with their footwear or clothes."
good,"Great learning experience.... There was a lot of travel involved. Which included, travelling to three cities in one day at times. Travelling on the company plane was nice. Travelling commercial was a challenge at times."
good,Hard having a sales quota to reach. Not fun working on the weekends. Enjoyable meeting people & making new friends. Nice to be able to see items as they go on sale.
good,"if I opened for the day I would have to go in and count out the money for the register I would be using that day. I would go through and make sure everything was set up nice and neat on the floor, if there was returns left at the station I would take them and put them away. I started in the children's department an had moved over to the home department, was learning the merchandise that was in the home dept. so when customers would come in I could tell them about the products we had. The hardest part of my job would have ben in the home dept. wen merchandise comes in an is to go on to the floor like the dishes they came in boxes, an were heavy, lifting an moving them were a bit rough, an the sales goals we had to meet those were the hardest part of the job. the enjoyable parts were customers, I think it was just meeting all different types of people."
good,"Clock in, open cash registers, make sure fitting rooms are clean and free of garments. Once the store is open concentration is focused completely on the customers. During slow times of the day we restocked and arranged products for display."
good,"The money was good, management was not. I was at work more than I was at home. You get your schedule a month in advanced, paid every week. I would go back part time, not full time."
good,My typical day at work is very slow. The hardest part of the job is staying busy and keeping up with sales because business is very slow. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the pay.
good,"Management doesnt really help out as much as they should."
good,"the compensation and employees are great, however; the environment created by Dillard's protocol  is outdated and pits team members against each other, instead of creating a progressive work environment. I think that if each department worked towards a daily goal as a united front, a lot more would get done and it would solve numerous petty issues that Dillard's creates."
good,"Outdated measures of job performance. Pay is based on sales per hour made only within your department and returns are deducted from your sale totals regardless of reason for return with no time limit.  If you do not make a raise goal, you do not get more money and can even be given a pay cut. This promotes a stab in the back atmosphere as fellow employees will ring your sales under their own sign in and steal them from you in order to make their day. If you work under 25 hours a week you lose all benefits."
good,Work environment is good for the most part.  You will work day or night.  Weekdays and weekends so definitely plan on losing time with family and friends.
good,"A typical day at Dillard's as a sales associate consists of assisting all customers and selling to meet a daily sales quota. I've learned how to deal with difficult customers and equally enjoyable ones. How to develop a relationship with customers. Management is decent. My co-workers are easy to work with. There isn't a hard part about my job, the most challenging thing is meeting sales quota with the hours that I work. Most enjoyable part of my job is assisting customers and building a lasting shopping relationship with some customers."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's is all about making your quota; that's really all they care about. When you make your numbers, you can be promoted to other areas of the store. I was promoted from women's fragrance to one of the cosmetic counters. Some managers are very helpful while others only care about if you're making money. Customer's are very friendly, for the most part, and enjoy learning about new merchandise. The hardest part of the job is competing with more upscale department stores in the mall. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers, customers, and the discounts you get."
good,"I worked at Dillard's for two years, and I can now say I'm a happier person since I've left. Advancing in the company is easy, but you must have tough skin. Morning rallies should be motivating not degrading as to how poor employees performed the previous shift. I've spoken to my fellow co-workers that also left and we always have the same thing in common that we are sooo happy to be away from that place it turned us into unhappy individuals. If you want to see your co workers get slapped and hit numerously while arguing over sales this is the place to be."
good,working at dillards I worked with a lot of teens and helping them get clothes for prom or a new school year. I learned the difference in brands and how to tell what to say to help customers with their choices. The hard part about the job was trying to sell their credit cards. I loved hanging with my coworkers and customers daily.
good,"Very slow with little to no traffic - even during holidays. SPH creates a cut throat negative commission atmosphere which is not a good atmosphere for customers."
good,No job security. Poor management. Cut my pay did not get along with some of my coworkers
good,"you come in in the morning do housekeeping for two hours, then unload trucks, process  merchandise, take to the sales floors, check restrooms. Everyone works well as a team."
good,"Great job, I just didn't like that they have a quota to meet in order to keep your job"
good,"Management only likes butt kissers."
good,"Overall, the culture at Dillards is okay. I really like the people in my department (Mens Department) which makes it fun and we also work well together. The main things I have learned is how to communicate better with customers and build trust, which creates stronger relationships. This has helped me achieve my quota every month and network to future clients."
good,"I miss Gayfers so much .. It was a great store, and we had so much fun there. I celebrate the opportunity that I got to enjoy the privilege of being there!"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of either 9 or 10 hour shift helping customers with direct product requests, demonstrating new products, skin care consultations, and makeovers. I learned to increase sales by pairing or recommending multiple products to achieve the results the customer was wanting to achieve. "
good,It's easy work and the pay was competitive for the type of industry.  They are not supportive if you have to go to school at all.
good,"Working with customers helping them find just the right outfit they were looking for.  The hardest part of this job was putting out stock on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing my customers after 24 years and knew just what they were looking for. The co-workers  in my department worked well "
good,"Selling, cashier, markdowns, sizing watches, taking incoming calls.I learned how to approach customers and how to sell and item or many items. I had a wonderful Manger she was the best then she transferred to Florida. The new Manger was great as well. I made lot of friends there that I still speak to this day. The most hardest about the job was working really long hours when other employees would call in. I like seeing all my repeat customers and telling them the new latest watch or handbags that just came in. I and also liked having lunch with many of my coworkers."
good,"long hours "
good,"I worked on commission in Ladies shoes.  It was competitive but enjoyable."
good,"•Ensure that customer receives outstanding customer service by providing a friendly environment. "
good,"work for a company where there is no formal training. Everything that you learn is from previous challenges you have faced or from other managers. Make the best of what is given to you as I have for almost 7 years. If you want to advance more than likely you will end up in Little Rock, Arkansas."
good,Basic skills needed to sell. Not any updated equipment or no classes as promised. No open door policy in management as earlier stated in interview but I had no problems with anyone so I did my job until after the holidays. Fantastic discounts. 
good,"The store manager would cuss at us in the morning meetings, they are so concerned on getting the next credit app. They don't care whether the customer is happy or unhappy, as long as they are making business!"
good,Fun to work in if you are just getting a job. Good experience to gain for future jobs
good,"Dillard's is a okay place to work, most people there are friendly and helpful. The management there needs a lot of work. Lack of comcation, and do not care about the employees"
good,"A typical work day as a manager consists of reviewing schedule, planning floor moves, customer service, store supervision, daily and weekly associate sales reviews, setting sales goals, merchandising and team work with associates and managers."
good,"My immediate manager was a joy to work for. He was hard working and appreciative of all we did. I enjoyed the crew, they were my second family."
good,would not pick this as long term job. advancement and pay depends 100% on if you make your quota or not. I can be the only one working in my department all day ring up every customer and not even make half of my quota
good,Advised customers on men's clothing fashions and coordination. Measured and marked suits for custom alterations.
good,"Management has the most turn-over rate, you never really know who is managing you. Then when they quit, they replace the spot with employees who can't dress and are not qualified. There are long hours, and hard to get pay raises. They promise you the world in training but once you are out on the floor you realize that they lied. It is a terrible company to work for. If you do not make the crazy high sales quotas then they will cut your pay by a $1.00. Even the employees at the store before you get out of training will tell you how much they hate the job and that they cannot wait to leave. The good manager are taken advantage of and will go weeks without days off and are picked on. It is terrible there."
good,Things need to be better.No drama Co-worker.The job was not hard.
good,Greeting customers helping with their purchases achieving sph.
good,"A typical day at dillards is slow, until the weekend. There are no chances for management. Co-workers are find, but not that helpful. the only enjoyable thing about the job is the look on a customer face when you have given them great customer service, and there happy when there leaving the store.."
good,"I have gained a huge amount of customer service experience working at Dillard's and my co-workers are amazing; however, I am at the point in my career path where I want to enhance my exceptional organization and great customer service skills."
good,"Displayed clothing according to each designer's floor plan; learned about correct signage on clothing racks; placed sale prices on items that were on sale; assisted customers with questions about sizes and colors; Hardest part of job was maintaining that daily sales goal. Newer sales associates had to compete with sales associates that had established clientele. I liked the Christmas season best of all , because the store is festive, people are happy and I like to wrap gifts."
good,"cleaned sales floor, unloaded trucks, did customer carryouts."
good,Great diverse culture among employees. Very young and high turn over. Limited employee retention so advancement is quick if you are competitive and show up.
good,"Poor non-inclusive management stream. They operate in a bubble."
good,you have to make a sales quota on a day to day bass and you have co works try to steal you'er sell so its pretty hard on you and you have to deal with some with customer trying to steal from
good,"This job is basically you can save money just don’t stay long. The only thing that I didn’t like is that the company does not hire within, their employees."
good,"Either open (9A-6P sometimes 7P) or close shifts(11A or 12p - 9P) wouldn’t recommend for someone that’s a single parent without help. Also if you close you can’t leave at the time your schedule says you leave when they decide to release you. Competitive atmosphere due to daily sales especially during sales. The pay is good for starting off and it’s weekly, you do have reviews every year which determines your raise or being let go."
good,As long as you don't mind stepping on people's toes to get sales then you will be ok. If you're not making your quota you will be let go. You are lucky if you get one of the managers that helps you get the work done in their departments so that you don't have to do it all alone while trying to get all of your sales too. Some of the other employees do not help to get the work done and just sell.
good,You can make good money at dillards if you land a commission based job (9% of sales) although you will rarely have days off and work long shifts. Not unusual to work 6 days a week and other employees can become very competitive.
good,"They want you to sale, but you cant when there isnt people to sell too."
good,"I worked here for about 16 months, 10 months as a part time dock employee and then the rest as a full time sales associate. The dock work was a bit labor intensive but overall not that difficult. However, when I expressed interest in going to the sales floor, I was met with much adversity. I was not respected by the upper management and felt like my skills and eagerness to assist customers was undervalued. The upper management only cares about meeting sales goals and if you are not doing that, it doesn't matter who the employee is or how long they have been with the company, they will let them go."
good,"Don’t really work with you if you have children, or have appointments they will not excuse it at all. Always pushing credit applications. Management is dirt"
good,Upper management was passive aggressive and very all over the place. Was told I was not just a holiday hire but hours were cut by more than half after only 3 months being there. Other coworkers were friendly and pay was good but there are no raises and the hours were not livable.
good,Upper management is not around as much as needed to help the store and when they do arrive they let you go if they see something they don’t like .  If they do like what they see they will stop and complement you in person
good,I worked as a sales associate and cashier at Dillard's in the junior's department i help customer's with finding new fashion's prom dresses and causal wear. I also ran the register.
good,"The pay is below for area "
good,"As a Business Manager, I was responsible for a team, however, when I needed back-up from upper management, I was always told that we could not afford to ""lose people."" Thus, Sales Associates get away with being late, constant call-offs, and even no call-no shows."
good,"The typical day at Dillard's starts off my clocking in then counting the registers. Following this, the remainder of the day will be strictly devoted to generating sales and getting customers to apply for credit cards. If these goals are not met the company will proceed with termination."
good,management was very shady and not the best. They offer to give you better advancements but it does not ever happen. they switch people off and on positions in the store so much. They pick favorites and the managers can never say anything to you face-to-face (meaning the store and assets store). They go through the managers below. Co-workers are very nice to work with and make it fun. Management is just very poor.
good,The departments managers are nice well most of them. But the store manager wasn’t understanding and not polite. It’s a good temporary job. Can get stressful cause you have to make your quota a day and definitely not a teamwork job.
good,The job itself for almost everyone you talk to will tell you they don't enjoy it management is horrible the mood of the store is even worse the pay was great starting  out but Never got a raise in the years I worked there.
good,"Job security, Terrible Management, Contradicting rules, A lot of Favoritism, great discount, good incentives sometimes from brands not dillards, their schedule system sucks and you probably never get weekends off but its retail kind of expected"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty average you may see a couple of suspicious people and have to watch them but overall its just watching people shop. The problems arise when someone does take according to my manager the security guard is not allowed to stop the, so they must wait for a manager to get there. However most of the time the person is long gone before anyone is able to stop them."
good,I enjoyed my area (Handbags and Accessories) they job it self wasn't bad it's the people that you work with don't know how to work as a team! Team works make the Dreams work! My job was never to hard. The manger and Store manger make it hard for people that want to work
good,"I worked for Dillard’s 2 1/2yrs. I enjoyed it for the most part. After one month of being there I got my own section in the men’s dept working in denim and urban wear. Had complete automony to show off my merchandising skills. Working in Charlotte I was able to garner relationships with professional athletes to bring in business. My goal was become the stores merchandiser. I dressed all the men’s floor windows and I accomplished high sales for the floor.  The drawbacks are the idea of maintaining a sales goal per day when Dillard’s rarely have sales. Their biggest sale is New Years.  Before that, people would use Dillard’s parking lot to get to the other big box stores. And so if the goals aren’t met they deduct your pay. The other is the practice of getting other associates to give a coworker their sale if you want to be promoted. It’s an all day thing. And if that sales goal is met, you get the promotion."
good,"pay is good, management is questionable. I did not hate it but definitely never felt secure in the workplace. Would recommend for anyone looking for part-time work and just for extra money."
good,not a great job but the pay is good. 30 min lunches i dont have anything else to say but they require this review to be longer sooo here we are still typing
good,A very cut throat store were all employees only look out for themselves and their sales goals they don't work to help everyone meet their sales goals they only care about their own numbers
good,"Dillard's corporately sounds like a great place to work but when you take it to the store level the do not practice what they preach. When I moved to the store level I was shocked how employees were treated."
good,"My day pretty much starts off with me being the only one to clean up the whole store, unload trucks, and deliver heavy packages. It was quite difficult to work there because I was the only one who really put in any work at all. The management wasn't too great. They were terrible at scheduling and keeping their employees in check. The hardest part of this job, was being quick to unload the truck as well as process the packages and deliver them as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to help out customers."
good,"I worked at Dillard's for 5 years as a shoes sales associate. There were many part time workers and fewer full time employees. The full time employees did not get the most desirable work hours. The work was not evenly distributed among the sales associates full or part time. Overall, there was very little support for employees.  However, I was well compensated with the relationships that I developed with my customers. The sales, in turn, were high because of this. I'm truly grateful for the work experience."
good,At the time the culture was very competitive and getting credit applications was what management was pushing. That was hard to do. You had quotas and they were very high!!!!
good,"You can be the most hard working person but if you don’t make numbers, you are out. "
good,"I liked working there but I quit for health issues. After I left they marked me as unrehirmable because I didn't meet sales, which effected trying to get new job. Never once told me my pay was being effected nor told me I would be nonrehirable."
good,"Fun place to work. Sales goals are unattainable most of the time. They also need to do a better job of promoting their managers. Seems like a lot of them don""t know what they are doing half the time."
good,"I answered phones, helped customers with exchanges, paying their bill and did a lot of gift wrap, especially since it was holiday season. I did not get to involved with management since I worked mostly evenings and they were gone by then.  The hardest part of the job was working in an environment where people weren't that happy to be there.  I wasn't there long and it was a long time ago so maybe things have improved. I enjoyed serving customers and wrapping gifts."
good,days are busy there is always something to do or work on .en joy speaking with account manager. Hardest part of job is not being valued. workplace culture is very business driven make the day use your client registry. Pre selling all the time for special events in store.
good,"Place is OK. Support pay isn't that great, dont get raises. Management needs work. Have to make quota if you work on the sales floor. Has a good discount. Healthcare insurance sucks. Dental and vision are ok. They have 401k which matches 3%. Difficult to be promoted."
good,"It is a good ""temp"" position until you can transition into another position. Heavy emphasis on getting a credit applicstion a week. The full time rotating schecules can be challenging."
good,"If that's what you want "
good,"Love working with my coworkers , The people at the job wasn’t going to my coworkers ,Company did not appreciate the workers that’s been there 10+ years always seem to be overlooked always gone in a different direction then the good people that work there"
good,Managers act like they are very stressed but great part time job. You can move to different positions until you find what your good at. Holidays are crazy busy and you can usually get extra hours.
good,"If i was asked should YOU work for this company, I would say no. The pay is decent but I'm not sure if it's worth the mental constipation.  The management is horrible."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for. Management was friendly and seen regularly. Other employees were friendly, but competitive due to hourly goals."
good,"I would not work full time here again. It is more of a summer job or temp job, especially during the holidays. It is very fast paced and competitive. The people are great to work with."
good,"Sales competitive among sales staff"
good,"Working at Dillard's from day to day varied from stressful to slow to exciting. I learned a lot about making sales, but the competitive atmosphere between coworkers to reach their goals often caused strain between the employees. Every day there is something new going on that you're expected to tell customers about, and to try and sell to the customers, and some days there are 5+ events that you're supposed to invite every customer to. It can be really overwhelming. The managers tend to ignore you if you do well, but if you aren't doing well it can be a nightmare. The customers made it worth the while though, they're fantastic. They are so sweet and they really care about the people helping them. I'll never forget my regular customers at the store, and I look forward to seeing them outside of work."
good,"Hardest part of the job was to reach a certain sales goal when competing with the entire store and having such high standard daily sales, especially when customers would rarely go into the store..."
good,"If you're a competitive person you may like working at Dillard's. If you are a sales associate, you must maintain a sales quota. The sales quotas are very high and unrealistic for the customer flow. Clothing stores like Dillard's aren't as busy as they used to be and management puts immense pressure on the associates to meet unrealistic sales goals. In turn, associates become very deceiving and hostile towards one another. A typical day at work involves associates swarming the few customers that enter the store so they can meet their goal. Many associates who have been with Dillard's for a long time have learned to break and bend the rules in order to maintain their sales. Management will not discipline these individuals as long as they are bringing in a lot of money."
good,"My coworkers were decent however others can be cutthroat when it comes to sales and making their sales goals. Expect to work six days straight averaging 42-50 hours a week if there's a holiday Easter, Thanksgiving, Jul 4th,Christmas, Labor Day, etc Although your schedule is set expect to stay 30 minutes after closing. Managers were disorganized"
good,"Managers don't tend to care about their employees. Opening credit cards and achieving sales quotas is the focus. If you do achieve your quota, they raise it. If you do not, they cut your pay."
good,"On your feet all day! No benifits,not that good maybe for people that like retail or want normal part time jobs.I would not do it again ,retail is not worth it,only the fiscounts might be good."
good,"great job for advancement and young thriving salesmen. It is very competitive, but as long as sales are made you will be paid accordingly. Don't expect commission unless you have been their for a while."
good,"Dillard's is very particular about getting task done fast and accurate."
good,"face paced, highly competitive sales; particularly during Holidays"
good,A typical work day involved selling merchandise and learning new sales tactics. Management was helpful. Work Culture was fair. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals.
good,"Excelled myself in 3years from sales associate to floor manager was later wrongfully discharged and had to open lawsuit cause employees are not protected by this company, that is micromanaged by individual store managers and not HR. The unemployment office was furious about my discharge and awarded my full compensation . I would have rather kept my job on a non-managerial level instead of being transferred to a management position just to be made a mockery of my age and race. Becareful your protected by HR."
good,Its pretty relaxed once you get the hang of things but it is stressful and competitive. I am a counter manager there but even being a counter manager you don't get paid more. Some people are really great to work with. I think the overall management could be better.
good,It's an alright place to work. They just never did give me enough hours to work. I've always been willing to work more time than I ever got the opportunity to do.
good,ok place to work if you are in school or in need os a secound job....good thing about the job is if you wanted to work in a nother deprent you could go over and learn
good,"While I enjoyed my job at Dillards, the expectation of sales was set too high.  I believe that these goals would be easy to achieve if the customer base was there.  However, Dillards does no advertising except to current clientele through email.  The amount of foot traffic in Crossroads Mall is very low making it difficult to increase customer base.  I do however believe that another Dillards in a larger city would have afforded a more contusive  environment for sales"
good,"I got to work with women's wear and learn a lot of different brands and sell to many different occasions. Such as juniors for prom, dresses for weddings to funerals, everyday wear for petite to plus sizes and then I got to work occasionally in the designer departments too."
good,"I truly believe that Dillard's is a great clothing department store, but I was unable to use my vast set of skills to better the company. I really enjoy taking on responsibility and i felt that this company was not challenging enough."
good,Working at Dillards was ok but you're constantly stressed about making your sales quota which is unnecessarily high . Ifs like you're doomed from the start. I also worked on the dock and I enjoyed it the hours were great and it was laid back and easy. Then I got moved to the floor that's when I started to not like working there so much. Too much drama. You have other associates stealing your customers it's just too much
good,"Overall a good environment, friendly staff and a cohesive daily operations system. Room for advancement is decent, given you are willing to be flexible with your hours as this is retail. Competitive but doable for the younger or mature without dependent children."
good,"being a sales associate in Dillards is all about one thing. Quotas. Those who meet their quotas stay, those who do not are cast aside. Dillard's often over hires for seasonal help and keeps them on forcing you to compete for your own job on a yearly basis."
good,A typical day at work is slow unless it is a weekend. The job is quota based so it is extremely competitive and with so few customers it becomes cutthroat.
good,They told me in my interview I was not a seasonal employee and then I became one. Management gives you busy work just and they do not help you make your numbers.
good,"Dillards was not a great place to work, expectations were not made clear, management was unavailable/unapproachable. Did not offer benefits or sick or vacation time."
good,"Most days are fairly easy, with time to complete putting up the new freight and then selling to customers every day. Training is next to nothing, and the competitive nature of the job means many of your coworkers will not help. This is a job that is declining very quickly, as many people simply do not shop at malls anymore. Making your days to get commission is quite stressful as there are not many customers and too many salesmen and saleswomen."
good,"Dillard's is a great place to shop but not the best place to work. The location I worked at seemed very nice and fairly busy at times. Most people start off at $12 an hour there and it seems very nice at first. Once you start working there you realize all the hard work that comes with such a good pay. Most of the work I did was manageable and I got through it easily but we weren't getting much business in my department. Dillard's is all about sales and making your quota and if your not you can kiss your job goodbye really soon. They are a very cut-throat business and only keep people who are gonna make them money, despite of any other positive things they can bring to the company. I would recommend Dillards only to people who can sell someone a dead fish lol. They are crazy competitive there and your fellow employees will try to steal your sales."
good,"Dillard's is all about sales and credit applications. If you do not like being pressured to sale more and hassle customers to buy multiple items and sign up for a credit card, then run the other way. I had my job threatened several time because my numbers were not to ""standards"" during times that we did not really have the customer base to be able to achieve those numbers to begin with."
good,"The quotas are ridiculous, mine was usually $2100 a day in the Juniors Dept. "
good,Difficult to manage the productivity numbers they want.  More and more people are shopping on line and find it easy to purchase this way.  This type of retail is challenging.
good,"Promoted till last store, then the store manager said I was not management type.  Before that I was promoted every 6 months to a year with glowing reviews and raises every year."
good,"Not a bad place to work at if you don't mind competing against coworkers. Starts off paying good but they give you unreal sales goals to prevent from having to give you a raise. For example: Working a 5 hour shift in an area where items range from $5 - $100 max, and having a sales goal of $1200. Now you are allowed to sell handbags and watches as well but good luck trying to while the full time specialist our present."
good,made some good friends. But the demands are just to impossible. Goals keep getting hire and hire. Would work great if the store was in a city. Not a community.
good,I liked working with the people around me some of the managers can be tough to work with though. Job is based upon making numbersand most of the time it is very very slow other than sale days and weekends
good,It is a nice place to work.  The pay is decent overall.  You have to work hard at getting sales and even may cut others off on the sale.  Get to dress up and keep up with the last trends.  But even as an employee you still may not be able to afford their stuff cause the discounts are not really that good.
good,"my working days at Dillards was good"
good,Dillards itself isn't a terrible place to work but it all depends on management. Management has killed my desire to stay in retail. Customers don't help but when management refuses to back up their employees it makes it very difficult to keep face infront of others.
good,The job has great pay and great benefits the work environment can get very stressful. Also it's very easy to move up and grow with the company if interested.
good,"The management is horrible, the people in the business have attitudes every day.  Also they try and make you sell shoes to a customer that doesn't even want to buy shoes."
good,"Only allows employees up to 28 hours of work each week"
good,"Very hard to get anything done with management. Hours were always there, even when you didn't want them to be. Sales per hour mandate was ridiculous and counter productive"
good,"Quota's for pay. If can't make it, fired. If can make it raises are fabulous. Reviews based on sales. Period. Attendance, Loyalty, Customer Service, Knowledge don't mean a thing. If you're a shark for sales, you'll do great"
good,Pretty laid back. A lot of management changing and employees leaving due to lack of structure of management. A typical work day would include returns and cash counting and changing
good,"They pay well, so it makes up for the fact that there's no job security. So your constantly reminded that they can let you go whenever they feel like."
good,"long hours, have a standard of sales you have to meet or you will get behind on sales quota.  overstaffed so too many people working in department"
good,"Customer service, Visual and Case displays was the main things that occurred on a daily bases. There management was unprofessional, made unethical statement which were in appropriate, and does not the real meaning of teamwork or communication. Their management team on corresponded to top volume departments. I enjoyed all my co-workers in which I worked with and enjoyed everything I did including my customers I meet and still communicate with since I no longer work there."
good,"Typical day store traffic pretty slow, managers always near to help coworkers did daily duties, the hardest part would be dealing with the slow traffic and most enjoyable would be the client relatinships I was able to make at this job."
good,"Dillard's, Inc. is a great place to work if you only want a large paycheck. I have learned alot while working at Dillards. However, one of the most important things I have learned has been who I am and what I am willing to accept in my professional career, in terms of ethical decisions. I have learned I am not a person who wants to work for a company who only promotes those who are willing to relocate, not promoting based on merit or ability. This is problematic because the company is promoting those who are not qualified to lead others; Ultimately, Dillard's places store managers in their position primarily because on an individual's mobility status, not on ability. I do not recommend this company for those who have high moral and ethical standards. I have worked for this company for almost 10 years and I have been a manager with the company for over 9 years. I have seen many store managers come and go, some qualified and others only in the position because of their mobility status. Those who are not qualified for their position are office managers and have zero knowledge of merchandising, customer service, and managerial skills. It can change a store's dynamics. I have seen a store which was the best in a district by measures of sales increases, express credit applications, and best overall attitude from associates, take a drastic fall because of store and assistant store manager treatment of the sales associates. Treatment of employees is not valued by Dillard's. They may pay well, however, the treatment of their employees is a disgrace."
good,"I work not enough hours, they have too many people on the floor at one time. Not enough business comes thru. I am looking for something more long term and better for my family."
good,"It was a hard role to play, but at the end of the day, can lead to personal advancements. Lots of ""Politics"" to be played. Great co-workers, but can be difficult to make it up the ladder, as the corporate agenda changes often."
good,"It is a hard, competitive area to work at.  Once I learned the ""culture"", it became easier for me.  I loved meeting new associates and customers.  I learned a lot about make-up, scents, and fashion.  That was fun."
good,"A typical day at Dillards is customer service, restocking, and maintaining cleaniness throughout the department.  I've learned from this job that you must have a thick skin because sometimes you end up with the rudest customers demanding certain items.  It would have been a better work environment if the manager herself would be hands on with everyone too instead coupe in the office.  Most enjoyable part of this job is when a customer leaves satisfied with their items."
good,"Customer interactions are very good, rarely a conflict. Store is older and run down. Management is very condescending and sales goals are too high.... unattainable"
good,Assisted customers with merchandise. Learned how to sell effectively. Could never have a saturday off. co-workers were nice and the environment was a team oriented place.
good,"Dillard's is a very efficient place to work at. The idea is to sell merchandise and credit cards to almost every customer that walks in. A typical day at work is just merchandising, handling the register, interacting with customers, and keeping the floor organized and clean. I learned a lot about the business and retail industries here. Management is quite strict, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. They're very tip-top shape. Co-workers are great people who are fun to work with and talk to. You meet a lot of great people here. The hardest part of the job is when there are crazy sales with an overflow of customers, receiving new merchandise (and a lot of it), and dealing with sour customers (but thats easy to get over). The most enjoyable part is having great customers who relate to you and really appreciate the time you give them, working with co-workers who become great friends, and getting good pay"
good,"Fun place to work ,there is a lot of variety and creativity you get to take on with the daily tasks and projects. You do have a sales goal to reach to stay employed and you must be vigorous in doing so. Ask your manager questions regarding sales practices, instead of co workers to avoid misleading information. It is a shark fest            among st employees."
good,"While being an employee at Dillard's, I learned a lot about customer service and how to manage a positive in every atmosphere. During a typical work day, the employee has to have a goal in mind that they are working to accomplish. If there is not goal set, your day will not be as productive as wished. You have to learn how to maintain in front of other associates, when they are having a bad day and implement a positive day. The greatest excitement that I received from working at Dillard's, is seeing the customers come into the store, get what they want, and be further convinced to purchase whatever new product was on the shelf. Seeing the customers happy, whether they are purchasing or involved in a consultation, made me the happiest."
good,"Given the demographics of the area, and taking into consideration of that, selling suits for my job is not what I would call easy. However, with the prior being said, I have made excellent sales and made daily sales goals. I have learned that customer service in such a field is paramount. As a salesman, you need to identify what the customer needs and would like to buy, as well as link to items that they may want to look for in a later season."
good,My day consist of unloading trucks. Keeping the restrooms and dressing rooms clean for the customers. Also made sure the stock was put on the sales floor.
good,"A typical work day consists of making sure my area is in perfect order to start the day making sure we have all f the supplies and signage need for that day, checking my schedules daily to ensure I have the proper coverage for the day. I have learned that in management you are not only responsible for your own actions but the actions of your team, so by doing that is to make sure they are trained  properly and just making sure it's a pleasant working environment. You have to be neutral when it comes to the team and display good leadership. I have an awesome team I have had to train them to work together and not against each other. The hardest part is losing associates when they're promoted to other areas, . I am a certified bra fitter and the best part and most enjoyable part of my job is giving those ladies a life changing experience. When the women come in with doubt of not being able to wear a bra or jut getting through the day being comfortable you have to be willing to show them I care and I'm here to help you and you and deliver by first getting them in there, and they can actually see the difference is a moment you don't want to forget they leave out with tears, hugs , thank you. I have had some call the store or request to see my Manager to express their experience, the write letters. Just knowing I have had a positive impact on someone's life is and they leave happy is enough for me."
good,"enjoyed helping people with their beauty needs and making new clients enjoy the experience in the cosmetics department."
good,I will not review this company. I feel that it is not something I'm comfortable with. Like all retail you need to sell people things and meet a quota.
good,"A typical day includes researching problems with orders, contacting vendors and compiling orders. It is an opportunity to work for a good retail company."
good,Sales Associates are a huge part of building displays and working with customers. If you are a natural salesperson or people lover you'll enjoy this job. There is room for creativity in dressing mannequins and displaying merchandise. There is a lot of pressure to make your sales and it's very competitive. You will also have a hard time getting time off on evenings and especially weekends or holidays.
good,at one time the company had a great team and working together as 1 company.  Now the company is on too many paths at once and not productive.
good,"I was a Make-up counter manager, i would manage my counter team. conduct meetings on new products, inform customer on new products, also i would ring up customers and order and stock products, that also included product ordering and data entry. and cold calls "
good,I learned to work very independently. I worked in commission sales. Most of my required duties were clerically based. Work hours were flexible.
good,"I counted money in cash register, answered phone calls, greeted customers and made sure they were helped if needed, made sure clothes were folded nicely or hung correctly, cleaned out dressing rooms.   "
good,"at Dillards... your success is depended on clientel and sales...in which i would thought other wise... With little training, Ive learned a lot from a salesman point of view(thrown out to the wolves)  and it rewards at the end but thru it all I tend to ask myself if all this stress is really worth it....The management team seem to not have a care in the would as far as some situation but their own.. As far as co-workers  you""ll go from friends to enemies within a weeks time beacuse your competeing for sales.... The hardest part I had to come to realized with this company is that its not about customer service and appreciation from the sales associates.... its was  about money, money, money...who had the most sales...But the only thing I can say about that I love about the job was helping others make stressful decision at the last minute and to see customers come back to look for you to help them weather the sale was big or small but how he/she was treated in the process not pressured..."
good,"Dillard's is a great entry level company to gain experience.  They promote creativity, competition and sales growth in a positive way.  Unfortunately, there are a limited amount of career advancement opportunities.  The size of the company restricts upper management advancement, corporate headquarters is in Little Rock, Arkansas."
good,"great place to work."
good,My work day consist of promoting several different prestige cosmetic and skin care lines-one-on-one with clients; up-sale products; provide excellent customer service. I verified all transactions and balancing cash wrap; prepare bank deposits. Educate employees on standard procedure and exclusive cosmetics and skin care lines. Making plans for  in store and out of store events to promote product lines.
good,"Dillard's pays well for the job, but unfortunately the expectations were a bit ridiculous. I liked the people I worked with which made it much better. I love working with customers so that was enjoyable; however, being in a competitive environment made it hard at some points to give the best customer service possible. The management at the store I was with was very inconsistent because the company used it as a training site for managers."
good,"Given an hourly pay, you are also given an SPH (sales per hour) which is expected to be made. If your SPH is not met within review time they will either terminate you or cut your pay. The SPH goals are unrealistic to where employees constantly fight with one another over sales to make their quota for the day. Working for Dillard's I learned a lot of customer service traits I never obtained before and how to sell. Although, the hardest part of the job would be the environment of the workplace, it is like High School. You WILL work with women in their 50's who fight like children with you and management will do nothing about it, absolutely nothing. They also say that they like to promote from within instead of hiring others but that is a lie, they will not promote from within unless you go to the head of the managers in your store but even that is iffy. Dillard's, Inc., also doesn't believe in advertising so the store is always slow compared to Nordstrom and Macy's, their cliental is unstable. If you can handle a high SPH within a slow store and dodge the old greedy women, I say go for it."
good,"Help customers find the right look in clothing for them. I've learned how to merchandise and work on computer ordering special items. All co-workers are hard workers, just have to be careful not to let your customer walk away without cashing out with you. Hardest part of the job is getting customers to want to sign up for a rewards card. The most enjoyable is making the customers happy."
good,"low pay, management does not communicate, long hours, holiday hours, lack of advancement, treated poorly , and overall lack of happy associates around the work place."
good,"A typical Day is answering the phones, and sometimes getting up from your desk to email or copy something.  I have learned how to handle people especially in high stress situations since I deal with frustrated people on the phone all day.  The management is not coordinated well.  There are about 5 supervisors and none of them give the same answer too anything you ask them.  They make it had for employees to decide what to do based on their differences.  The co-workers are great, they just gossip a lot which isn't the best job atmosphere.  The hardest part of the job is solving extreme customer service jobs when a order gets extremely hard to fix.  The most enjoyable would be that if we aren't busy I have time to work on my homework in between phone calls."
good,the bulk of the day was trying to meet quotas of sales. which meant grabbing customers for sales before a co-worker would take them from you.
good,"Walk each floor, clean up from night before. Check with store manager to see what area they need done first. I did the windows, dress forms, floor moves, signing. I opened new Dillards stores, then closed them. Great people to work with. I learned to be flexable and think outside the box. Hardest part was being away opening stores up to 2 months. Working on something different every day was the most enjoyable to me."
good,job is ok for someone whole love people and has good pay good benefits
good,"I enjoyed my customers, as most of them were kind and friendly."
good,I was a sales associate in Home Goods department.  Sales and Customer Service. Please see resume.
good,"good place to start, management is poor, nothing hard about the job you just have to work for success, co workers friendly, learned great interpersonal skills, typical day at work can be exciting if you engage with customers"
good,"Maintaining an SPH is difficult, especially when business is down for the entire store, but is rewarding when you complete the big sales."
good,The amount of pay received for the time spent at work was not worth it to be away from my family.
good,"Being the store manager was overall a good experience. The everyday task were good but sometimes challenging but being a man who values a hard work ethic I was always able to overcome. I was responsible for schedules, deposits, all paperwork, hiring and firing if needed, display, and overall sales."
good,"I set and achieved personal sales goals while supporting the goals of the team. I helped to manage schedules, events and promotions. I was to communicate business opportunities that included line performance, stock levels and team motivation with senior management. I built and maintained strong vendor relationships to maximize business profits. On a daily basis, I provided customers with professional customer support while being honest, engaging and confident in product knowledge. I performed maintenance tasks including stock work, re-merchandising, display and merchandise transfers."
good,"pay is on a draw scale as in they give you a hourly quota that you have to maintain, if you don't they cut your pay."
good,The management at Dillards was unprofessional and there was no job security.
good,"1 hour lunch"
good,"This was not a bad job, but management had their favorites and if you weren't one they were not that friendly even if you went above and beyond what was expected of you."
good,It depends on the area that you work in if you are in a high volume sales area you will not Shreveport about your sales per hour
good,"All jobs are wonderfully energetic, and I have enjoyed them all"
good,"management terrible, would let you go in a instant, raises based on goals and credits"
good,They need to train there manager better in the areas they supervis. You can never do better then the managers or the employees.
good,The company as a whole was some what fare the co-worker and management was very nice.
good,Dillard's was a good experience. I learned about retail and taking care of a store.
good,"On a typical day I meet many new people and know that I send away many happy customers. I have learned how to work with many types of customers and their skin care needs. It is all about pleasing the customer. My counter manager is wonderful, however, there is an air of negativity and limited positive reinforcement in the general store atmosphere. My co-workers and I have a very stable relationship based on being fair and equitable. We enjoy working together. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the sales goals when there are no customers in the store. I enjoy going to work every day because I meet many new interesting people and I feel that we are friends by time they leave my counter."
good,Help customers with purchases of store merchandice. Placement of visual merchandiceing.
good,Got along well with co-workers.  My area managers were great.  I didn't like the amount we were expected to sell.  We did not have enough customers.
good,customer service and meeting people was a great  way to learn how to handle different problems.
good,"My typical day at work would be stocking, price checking, making sure signs are current and up to date,"
good,"Most days at Dillards' consisted of rushed pricing, zoning, and merchandising, followed by waiting to see if the traffic though my department would allow me to match in volume the other men's department sales.  I learned that I still have a lot to learn about closing the sale, as opposed to merely providing excellent customer service. I also learned that not all management approaches are universally effective in the same way."
good,"Dillard's is quota/commission based.  Each day, you are required to make a certain amount of money; roughly $1000.00/day or more depending on your pay and the department you work in. If business is slow, or if there's hardly any customers in the store, you are STILL required to sell this amount. If you don't, your pay will get cut, or you will get fired. Returns count against you as well. You also have to compete with other sales associates for customers. "
good,"The work wasn't that difficult, however the pressure to keep quotas up and get sales was very cut-throat.  It wasn't a friendly environment; other associates would do what they could to get ahead. "
good,I answer phones and gift wrap. I enjoy my co-workers and the I will plead the fifth when commenting on the management. 
good,"A typical day could go either way. It could be slow and on those days I took care of stock, helped out other department, set up for new inventory. On busy days I Loved because I could help four or five people at a time. I learned time management. Co-works made it a fun place to work. The hardest part was meeting a daily quota. The best part was helping customers.  "
good,"Dillard's is your typical department store. If your looking at a place to work that pays decent then I would give it a shot. However, they are very sales driven. If you fall below your sales per hour goal then at review time your pay gets docked. Then if you fall below a certain amount then you get canned. I would look at this job as a stepping stone for some and a career move for other. If retail is not your life's calling and your just looking for a job to make ends meet for a while then Dillard's would be ok. I would still keep looking though while you worked there."
good,"greeted customers with a smile. I had a large customers base that only wanted to order through me. I learned that we should work as a team. My co-workers all enjoyed when i was on at work, we worked very smoothly. Hardest part of work was the over 50lbs of weight on merchandise that needed to be put on shelves. Meeting new out of towner looking for the one special gift that i showed them and they leave satisfied with there purchase."
good,"On any given day the rules can change. I like the volume and that there is always something to do. I can move from department to department with no problems. I work well in a team atmosphere or on my own. My immediate supervisor leds her team very well, I enjoy her daily meetings."
good,A typical day at work means doing your best to satisfy our customers and help them find what they need! I work long shifts about 38.5 hours a week. I love the people I work with but my managers can be a little rough on us sometimes and hard. The things I enjoy most about this job is the people I work with and the pay.
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow employees.I learned a lot about how to take care of carpet and upholstery. I was never late for work. I did not take lunch breaks
good,"Changes in Management, and a lack of leadership focus made for a tough environment. However, we were always able to bring excitement and energy to what and how we did things."
good,"When we were buzy this job was fun, but in the summer months when everyone who can, flees the city, it was painful. I could only dust and wipe and reorganize and call customers so many times. Maybe I am a bit too type A for that job! but I like to be busy and productive. I got very sick of wearing lipstick all the time."
good,Only good for a while. Not good if you need balance in your life.
good,If you're a dock associate: It may actually be a stable long-term job. But depends on who your manager is; I got stuck with a crazy manager who made life tough. It's a physical job that will be good for your health.
good,employees were very nice. Management was very unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all types of customers helping them to find the right fragrances to suite there needs.
good,"i would go in, print out all mark downs and give to managers. Look and make sure everyone clocked in and out the previous day. Print out all store reports. Work on new employee files(if any). open up customer service drawer and get bags ready for each register."
good,"I provides clients with shoe expertise in order to find correct trend, fit, and comfort for their taste."
good,The Dillards that I worked at wanted me to make up fake information for credit applications. As a result of not doing this my pay was cut.
good,hours are good and so was the pay but managment was way too strict and its hard to move up and maintain sales goal do to low customers in stores and too many associates
good,"Usually very busy days as far as new shipment and cleanliness of dept. I learned alot about retail, customers etc. Management was okay. My co-workers were all very fun to work with. The part of the job was selling, we had a lot of slow days!! The most enjoyable part was helping customers, building relationships with them and knowing what they like and dont like."
good,"Counter manager sales, daily calling of customers to get sales, walk ailses to get customer to counter. I learned alot from my experience at Dillards, however the rules to the game at this store changed daily. The harest part about this job ws the way they kept dihonest sales associates hired. the most enjoyable part was elebrating the sale with the customer knowing I had done a great service."
good,"Na, na, na ,na ,na great place to be at. Great deals on clothes. Fun environment."
good,Not a bad place to work. You get what you put into the job all while dealing with the same pros and cons of any workplace.
good,Retail would have been great before the internet. Unfortunately working on commission there are not a lot of sales in the store and returns are extremely high
good,"The work is okay , it’s honestly not a very welcoming environment but can be a good way to help build confidence in sales . it can be a pushy environment as well"
good,"It was a very toxic work environment in my opinion. The way sales were set up to where you had to reach a specific goal or else your pay would decrease and also there wasn't a team aspect in working there. It paid my bills at the time but I didn't like working there because of disorganized management, they acted like you didn't have a life outside of the work place and like I said due to how sales were set up employees were hostile with one another and even customers at times."
good,It is what it is. You know what you’re getting into. Retail is kind of a sad job but the people were always really nice and tried to make you feel welcome
good,"Just about everyone you meet there will be nice off the floor but once they’re working, they will try and steal your customers. Some of those associates are retirees and don’t actually need the job and yet they’ll act as if they’re life depends on it. There are some nice managers however some are so two faced you’ll feel like you can speak with them but you’ll regret it later."
good,Very sales driven environment. Tough going in a World where you are competing against the internet. Generally a nice place. Competition for limited customers make for lots of sharks.
good,"if you don’t make your quota you have roughly less than a year to finnese them out of a weekly check until they decide let you go. They usually tell you to start looking for a job before they decide to actually do so tho so you’re not completely assed out, which is respectable. 10/10 would recommend if you need easy money very quickly. Attire is business casual but also fashion orriented. Co workers are usually nice with the expected work drama/gossip here and there."
good,Everything will only go well if you over achieve what is expected. When their expectations are not met they’ll target you. A fellow co-worker was making his quota but did get fired at his review for “not meeting the requirements.”
good,Really can not say much. Bcz thier CEO level needs be chnge to how more treat better for employees. System per hour sales called SPH is loose many of good associate.
good,Dillards sets unrealistic sales goals. There is a tremendous amount of work for which you get no credit.   You’re not allowed to advertise however they do expect you to get people in the store to sell to .
good,Full time hours are 36-39 hours a week part time hours are 19-25 hours a week. This company is a good company to work for if you are hired for full time
good,Pay was great but by it being a sales job it brought on stress by competing with others and if the quota wasnt made within a time period deficit I meant to say you got sent home which made the job harder because of foot traffic being slow
good,"I loved the fast paced environment working at Dillard’s and helping all the customers. However, I did not like that all the work we had to do while trying to make our sales and still being put down by management wasn’t very pleasant."
good,Dillards is a Sales position and your able to secure your job base on how well you can sell. I have been at Dillard’s almost a year; some days are better than others like you might sale really good and go above your sales goal and other days you barely have one sale. I work in the Men shoes and kids shoes department and we are supposed to sell out of our department only but you have many ofthe older coworkers that been there 5-20 years they don’t go by that rule and when business slow they will come in your section selling. I still get done like that after being here 10 months and it doesn’t do any good to tell management bc the people don’t listen and will still come over there selling your merchandise. As a shoe associate I only get credit for selling shoes and if I sell clothes it only counts against me
good,Fairly average place to work. Had its ups and downs. Quality of work life is very much dependent the store manager. Pay is influenced by your ability to meet sales goals.
good,"It’s fun getting to meet new people, and it’s very competitive when it comes to sales. Also make sure you meet your SPH when it your yearly review cause of its not met you will be either let go or forced to resign."
good,"Dillard's was of the philosophy that if you have more sales associates working you will sell more.But, if you don't make your sales goals for 3 months, you will not be there much longer. That was the way it worked many years ago, I don't know how it works now."
good,"Dillards is a good place to work at with a nice pay rate, but can be stressful for certain departments because pay is based off of commission and has unrealistic goals. They have high turn over rates however."
good,"Working here was fun at times, pay is good. Hard to get full time. Hours were eh, management sucked. Employee discount could honestly be better. 25% off doesn’t do much because they’re stuff is a bit pricey."
good,I dont think that this is a good environment for people to work in. It is very catty and they expect you to do more for the company than the company is doing for itself.
good,My experience at Dillards was horrid.  I had one of the worst and unsupportive managers I have ever had.  I know this is not true as a whole of the company and there are plenty of amazing people and managers within the company. But my particular location was horrible.  The manager was more interested in how he was perceived than what he needed to do to support his staff.
good,"Overall, my experience working at Dillard's has been interesting. Because you have to make a quota, people tend to be overly protective of their sales. It's not really their fault because they are trying to keep up their numbers, just like I was."
good,The company has a good product for the customer. But there is no job security or loyalty from this company no matter how hard you work. There is no consistency.
good,"Opportunities for all workers to advance their careers. Through dedication, hard work, great attendance, and overall good work ethic anyone can advance with this company."
good,"I had a very good supervisor, best manager I've ever had in fact. He was very caring and willing to work with employees regarding scheduling and such. Every store is different but mine was not a particularly tight-run ship. Several things about the company are very antiquated, most of all probably being the scheduling. Schedules were not very flexible at all, and there's no way to check them online, you have to go into the actual store to view it even though it's online, in the store. Employee messaging apps for finding coverage are not allowed. Schedules are also done by the month and were usually not released until said month, so usually on the first of each month I would have to call the store before opening to ask someone if I was supposed to work that day. If you can live with all that it's a pretty good job. Pays very well, comparatively to other department stores and some departments also earn commission. In larger cities and areas, some sales associates earning commission can make close to or well over 6 figures. Also, dress code was a little bit of a double standard in that male employees are required to wear at least a collared shirt and dress pants to work every day (most wear a shirt and tie, some even have to wear suits), meanwhile a girl friend of mine regularly got away with wearing black leggings and an oversized men's sweater to work. Most women in the cosmetics department wore black leggings or jeans and a black blouse to work, with tennis shoes every day. A nitpicky complaint, but a little annoying when you have to dress up in formal wear every day, while"
good,I didn't like the stressful and competitive atmosphere in there. I worked for two years there but every thing depends on how much you sell and how many credit cards you open every day. Still is a good point to start with.
good,"You have a quota here, and to keep your job you have to maintain. If you sell enough 1 year to get a raise, and not enough the next year, they might take your raise away. Only nice thing is the discount and hours."
good,Dillard's was a seasonal part time job. It was quick paced and active. It was a great work environment. I enjoyed working there during the holiday season.
good,The management I have is decent. If you are part-time your schedule is pretty flexible. I feel that SPH goals are unrealistic and pits associates against each other.
good,"Store with a low traffic.  Not a lot customers.  The hardest part of the job its a low traffic.  I loved everything with my clients, makeup, skincare, perfume, etc...I enjoy so much.  Work with different culture and I loved that so much."
good,Most days are quiet with unrealistic goals to hit unless you have a specified department and customers who see you. Sales are nice and bring customers in the door but not always guaranteed.
good,"Clocking in and checking out your area is how you would naturally start off a day. Upon seeing racks of untagged merchandise, grabbing a scanner and insticntively printing sales ticket after ticket, tagging it to the clothes. Sending racks upon racks of merchandise down to the corresponding sections and neatly displaying the colorful array of shirts, short, pants, skirts, and dresses."
good,"I enjoy the work and the people I work with.  Very high turnover in some departments.  You are told that you can work as much or as little as you want when you are hired in, but then you have no say in your work schedule."
good,overall the job is laid back but the store manager can be better  and we could get paid more. They do work with your life schedule and a very family orientated
good,I wish I would have had more hands on training since I did not have a strong background in sales management when I began working for the company. I was on the fast track with this company. I came in part-time because I was already employed full-time with another company. Within a year and a half I went from part-time to full-time to Area Sales Manager.
good,"No pay upgrade in customer service. Also no fulltime with benefits in Customer Service. During peak shopping season, they should hire more employees or authorize overtime."
good,"Like any job, there are things that happen that (sometimes) can't be controlled. Almost every day there is some situation that occurs where someone says ""it's not my problem"", and while that is true on occasion, nearly every time it really IS that person's problem to fix and the solution is often quite simple. People just do not seem to care at all and it causes quite a bit of stress for someone that does actually care."
good,"Everyone works with Dillard's  knows that working with this company it might give to the employee very strong experience in customer service and how to be a great sells associate as well but, at the same time it is very stressful environment to be with. And even the schedule was so crazy."
good,"Dock processing was always busy , janitorial service were always demanded. Friendly people, worked together sometimes. Good atmosphere, sometimes stressful."
good,"At least at the Dillard's I worked at, there is very poor management. They will change your schedule without notice, give promises of training that are not fulfilled, and just in general there is no professionalism whatsoever. Do not recommend for someone with little experience in a sales-based job."
good,Very time consuming and demanding making it hard to balance an at home life and work life. Good for people who aren't very family oriented and are career driven. Lots of opportunities for advancement if dedicated.
good,Dillard's was my first outside job beside working for my family and Dillard's gave me a lot of opportunities to learn every day. From person to person and from department to department. I just believe that throughout the whole entire time working at Dillard's I wish they work on their managing skills. I see some people had too much power and they take that in advantage to make others feel like they don't belong their. Every day I would clock in to work and see humans but no humanity. Please have humanity in your work too because we are humans and we are like one another.
good,"It's typically slow-paced on most days, which means there isn't always something to do so there may be times where you'll find yourself bored. "
good,"Its been 14 years since I worked for Dillard's so its hard for me to review for current management, culture etc. It was a good place for me to work. The management worked with my scheduling requests and I was compensated fairly."
good,It was ok I really don't have anything good  or bad to say about this company .Indeed is just fishing for bad news it over all was a good company .This is a waste of my time filling out this dumb survey
good,"Department manager is great store manager and above not so great. Pays well but they will give a paycut if you don't sell enough, they do not acknowledge a job well done unless your selling to their standards you can work and work and work but if you don't sell enoigh they don't care about you. The manager at this location let's top sales associates get away with whatever they want including threats to other associates. If the store manager was different I might care more for the job. But then again I feel like that's how the company wants it to be here so I don't know."
good,Didn't have many customers hard to get your sales per hour (sph). But i did like that they sent to a class to learn more about their products. I also like that they had a wedding registry and you get an extra $25 for every one you get but it takes away from getting customer to earn you sph.
good,"Dillard's overall is a good company. Some of the business practices and overall business cultures is very archaic. Old buildings, old technology, older style of fashions mixed with newer style fashions and trends here and there. It is very trend driven. Company culture is produce and make sales and open credit, everything else goes down the list. Aesthetics of the store are major focal points, yet interiors and fixtures do not last. However with less staff on hand in the current years, it becomes increasingly difficult to accomplish all tasks in a work week. With no merchandising staff, sales associates and managers are doing the work of 4 people; selling, selling credit, merchandising, recovery of store standards, etc. On the up side, Dillard's continues to be a top producer in retail sales, and holds strong in the marketplace. The hardest part of the job is again the continuing amount of tasks yet less people to do them, and the turnover is a constant factor. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with clientele, and providing a great experience for the customers. What I have learned from working at Dillard's is the retail experience should be an enjoyable one, creativity embraced, and an environment of growth; not a culture of do it this way because we said so, well you need should have done more, or react now. Retail is a continuing evolving environment, which lends itself to be a volatile environment. It has shown me who I want to become in life, and who I do not want to become. I have enjoyed working for Dillard's and still enjoy working for Dillard's,"
good,"Working several years for Dillard's was great while I was in college because the hours are flexible and the pay is decent for retail. "
good,"I had the opportunity to learn conflict resolution skills and management skills. I enjoyed the process of ;earning retail, however, it is a very competitive field to be in. Meeting daily sales quotas are important and managing people in retail can be very difficult."
good,Dillard's is a good place to work only if you can stand on your feet majority of the work day be able to bend and possibly lift boxes filled with product. A typical day at work would be coming in putting up your stock and helping the customers that comes in. The hardest part about the job would be meeting the sph goal (sales per hour) on a really slow day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping certain customers with what they needed helping them make decisions when they're indecisive.
good,Paid good money lack of advancement great customers and customer service some management issues new store manager eager and willing to make a change that is greatly needed but a high shrink store
good,"Must like to work retail hours, nights, weekends and holidays. Have customer service skills. Slow paced job most of the time but during holidays was busier."
good,"My experience in the camera room was fine. The camera operator who trained me was excellent, the reason I give lower reviews is because I was locked with no opportunity for advancement."
good,"Some good people started this store in a new mall in Littleton, Co and worked very hard but were mistreated by management. Since this was a new store most of upper management were in experienced and at times it showed."
good,"Open registers, assist customer with their purchase decisions clean fitting rooms. I learned many detail customer service procedures, setting up displays using space, colors, trends and styles. Computer application were sometimes very detailed when searching for merchandise for a customer in the store and on the phone to shipped or pick up. Very competitive atmosphere specially  when you have so many associates and not enough customer this was bad, but I loved the Merchandizing."
good,"Wonderful place to work, but the recession has set the company back. Loved the work culture. You will be successful with this company when you build your cliental."
good,I learned how to daily balance registers and cash drawer. A typical day at work depends on each customer that approach. It could be pleasant and other times you just have to be patience.
good,"I enjoyed the overall sales culture, merchandising and assisting customers.  However, the company did not provided the merchandise the customers in my specific area were looking for so sales were not what they could have been."
good,Everything about that job would have been perfect if the management was not so poor. It seriously is just that bad. They have had a pretty bad turnover rate and the sales expectations are too high.
good,Lots of experience in customer service as well as great interaction with co-workers. Dillard's offers full time employees benefits such as health and retirement.
good,Loved the people I worked with. Management was awful. Never helped always yelled. Only interested in store productivity not about the people who worked there.
good,"There was no employee loyalty from managers, employees were constantly being replaced and many times end up training their replacements without knowing."
good,"Retail is a fickle industry now and it can be cut throat if you don't make your sales quota. Dillard's corporate wise has gone down hill, micromanaging and firing good people."
good,"Dillard's Clearance Center is mainly a part time facility. The pay rate does not exceed $10 an hour. The hours are between 20-25, unless special sales like black friday are in play. Other than that, the staff and managers are very friendly and understanding."
good,"The job itself was fun and I enjoyed it. However, lower management often pitted employees against each other. I watched a coworker get punched in the face by another coworker over an $18 makeup sale. Upper management is great, but the department managers seem really not put together and dramatic."
good,I found it to be a stressful job it was a lot of he did she did going in the store management didn't really do anything about it and the store turned in to a discount store for the product they couldn't sale in other store made it hard to make sale goals.
good,"The management is always pressuring associates on sales expectations, credit applications, and extended work hours."
good,"I enjoyed the other employees who were friendly. However, a few you had to watch and make sure you received the sale. Customers were wonderful and fun. The 20% discount was exceptional because you could use it on sale items. I worked in the Lingerie Department and we did custom fitting for bras. Training was held in Oklahoma City about once a quarter.  Customers were nice, patient and fun. Christmas was stressful but everyone was understanding.  Management had a quota so I had to compete with her as well. I still shop at Dillard's."
good,"Working for Dillard's was much different from other retail stores i had the pleasure to work for. "
good,"It was fine working there. The big bosses come around pretty often (maybe proximity to corporate?) and management acts pretty crazy those days so that sucks. My store was fine with tattoos until they came around, and I was told one day I'd have to buy a shirt or go on break to hide my full sleeve. You also have to work some weird hours during holidays. I had to work 35-38 hours each week as part-time customer service from November to mid January, including all day Black Friday, Christmas Eve, and the day after Christmas. There's not any real room for advancement unless you want to go out to the floor, where there's plenty of room to move around."
good,"I am not agree with current store manager's style of management. Constant lying to associate, like offer something for extra job and never pay back.Almost impossible to get raise because of unreachable goals."
good,"As a retail job it of course revolves around sales.  Meeting sales goals set to individuals.  Depending on where you are stationed and the days, and time of days you work really does play a part in meeting those goals.  In the end, the people, both the co workers and the customers were overall great but those daily sales goal ended up being too difficult to meet."
good,Good place to rebuild employment resume if laid off. But pay too low for College educated professionals. If you have student loans or stay on your own it will be tough working just this job to survive.
good,"High pressure and unachievable goals. For managers and associates. Managers were handle responsible for employment attendance. As my Store Manager said to me ""Your head is on the chopping Block"". Because the associates who were in college. Did not always show up for work."
good,I enjoyed greeting and offering assistance to the customers. My co-workers were friendly and helpful also. There was always work to do but not to where I was overwhelmed.
good,"It pays well compared to most other mall jobs, but honestly, this isn't a place for great compensation or career growth. If you are younger and in school, it is a fine place to work for a couple years max. The management doesn't actually want to see you succeed, they try to treat it like some grade A sales environment but fall short in understanding there market and employees."
good,"I was fired because of my sales not been high enough. I loved the customer, but the manager is bipolar never happy. I Was always busy cleaning ,vacuuming, put freight away and didn't matter still got fired"
good,"Amazing fun enviroment to work and meet new friendly faces.On the downside of things, Dillards is a high demand ask of labor for small pay with low job security."
good,"i handle'd every shoe transaction that was in my department, while maintaining and making sure everything stayed clean. i was in charge of of the whole children's shoe department. displays, and the stock room. my manager rarely came down. the surrounding co workers were great, and fair. the hardest part was getting in touch with my manager. she didn't even know what went on."
good,"Coworkers make it a great environment to work in. Some areas of work have high goals to sell. Time off is good and breaks are wonderful, you can take hour long breaks or 30 minute breaks."
good,Competitive work environment will long hours. Sales quota and some bad management. It is ok but will take a lot out of your time. You will not have a life working here.
good,This job is indeed the survivor of the fittest you have to compete against  other sales associate and sometimes they take your sales definitely no job security
good,"Good place to work and good co-workers if in the right department. Management could be better. room for promotions but they take time. Cons: Working weekends and holidays, no time for family to friends."
good,"Great place to work for. Developed and learned many things from management. Difficult to maintain goals during slow times, but had great achievement at peak times."
good,"During the slow season if you don't make your quota (because its slow) you'll get your pay decreased to $11 no matter what you were originally being paid, then you have 3 months to get your sales back up and if you don't they fire you. Management was great but the way the company is ran as a whole needs to be improved."
good,"While working at Dillard's I learned how important communication is. Communication is vital in being able to maintain your work.  Management was nice overall, but I believe they could have communicated better, and been more organized. Overall the workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job was wishing that there was more people in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do makeovers on customers."
good,"Working at Dillard's rewarded me with the opportunity to develop clientele relationships, due to its location. As Counter Manager for Chanel, I learned valuable leadership skills."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting a selling quota, selling company credit cards, dressing room loss prevention, merchandising, and cleaning. The environment is very tense to work and build relations with coworkers. They are viewed as competition since your pay is based on your sales.  It creates stress on the customers, workers, and management when selling is as high a priority as the customers need/wants."
good,Typical day at work is Sales. Always sales. Learned a lot about retail. Management is average. Work place culture is ok depending which department you are working in. Hardest part of the job is the sales goals that is always hanging over your head. Got to know a lot of good and nice people. Shopping.
good,I like the job and the company. Hard to move up in the warehouse setting. The job is demanding and requires high motivation as most departments are production based pay.
good,A lot of standing on your feet and competing with co-workers for sales.  I did learn a lot about fashion and dressing nice.  If you were in certain managers good graces then they would help you by giving you good locations to work at.  The hardest part of the job is making your sales quota.
good,"Honestly, after the first hour or two, i've already got all my stocking and merchandising done, After that, I just kind of stand around all day. not because im lazy, but because there are no customers to sell too"
good,"You get a paycut if you are not reaching standard selling goal every 3 months, work 10 hour days with no OT, no breaks in between, always low on staff"
good,"Overly demanding work environment, especially around the holidays. Can take as long as 10 years to receive a title promotion. Poor management leadership. Employees are under appreciated. ""Old school"" business mentality. Low company morale."
good,"Senior management is a grab bag, depends on who you are working for.  There is great freedom in store to be entrepreneurial, but management can be quick to move on talent.  Tends to be more reactive than proactive in fashion trends and team development.  Bad work/life balance, but very competitive salary."
good,I have been working for Dillard for 23year and still doing the same thing and I'm tried. They will not let u move up in the company at all and that is a shame .no  bonus no nothing they give u nothing at all
good,You go in start helping customers with what they need or answering their questions. Good workplace you get to dress nice and stay neat the entire shift.
good,"Easy job, any one could do it. They give you ridiculous sales goals though and its pretty hard to make them. Lots of people are constantly let go because of their sales not reaching the really high standards that they set."
good,The managers were a lot more focused on just money and not on the quality of customer service provided to their customers. Co-workers were pinned against each other to make sales and jobs were threatened if you couldn't produce although there weren't many customers to sale to. Management spread rumors about associates instead of squashing the drama. The hardest part about the job was having to compete with others in an environment that wasn't lucrative. The most enjoyable part was getting to serve customers and helping them find the right shoe to fit the occasion they needed them for. I also enjoyed house keeping a lot. The stock room could get a bit messy and I liked to take the time to straighten it to make it easier to find shoes.
good,"management turnover was huge, manager at the time - she enjoyed firing and intimidating people (she is no longer with company), overall the atmosphere is typical for retail work, the owner's are NOT friendly to workers on visits, they ignore employees (some have been there 20+ years).  Always had to work a flexible schedule due to so many people coming and going.  Have to meet quota each month or you are let go."
good,"Dillard's as a whole isn't a bad company to work for. They pay well and the benefits are decent. As long as you gain product knowledge and aren't afraid to approach people, you will do fine as an employee."
good,"Not the best job in the world, but definitely not a bad start for somebody who does not have any sales-quota experience. Only problem I had was that you could not work more than 26/28 hours if you were part-time. Base pay is very good for an entry level retail-sales job."
good,"My typical day at work was working from 9-6. I work 28 hours a week. Managers were very nice and kind. During the week it was super slow, sometimes there wasn't customers.The most stress full and hard about this job, was that they required to get credit apps( rewards card) That's how they call them. Every time I would ask customers if they want to apply for one, the answer was no. The big managers were very strict about it. That would stress me out a lot."
good,Dillard's was a good place to work. The only times it got stressful were during the holidays and large sales events. The pay was good but the way their pay scale works really needs to be modified. I was laid off because I transferred to a smaller store and could not possibly make the sales goals they had set.
good,The work at Dillard's in itself is not very difficult. However the management staff is unappreciative and places unreasonably high goal on their employees. Causing them to overstress at there jobs making for an unhappy work environment.
good,"It was a good company, they really do care about family matters, but things have changed due to the new store manager, not really a happy place anymore."
good,"After clocking in, check the board to see what department to clean,"
good,My job is nice sometimes but i need other job and i really have a quality of life. The costumers so nice because i love people. But the people working with me have a lot drama about commission. I just looking some job close to my house and have a good energy.
good,"Loved my position at the counter however, working at Dillard's made me dislike going to work everyday. The sales goals were a bit unreal and they forced you to get people to apply for a credit card."
good,"The management is lacking, no promotion opportunities, incredibly dull (often) unrealistic sales goals. There really is not that much to say about this place."
good,"poor employee relations , no benefits. "
good,"You usually start work at 7am.(6am on holidays)"
good,Our pay scale was based on a sales per hour quota. This was sometimes hard to meet while working certain hours or certain days. My typical day at work involved greeting customers and assisting those customers to the best of my ability. Working at a large department store was a great learning experience.
good,"Typical day at work - Count and open registers, stock and organize department, price and ticket items, answer customer inquiries, cashier (check out customers), resolve any customer issues, count and close registers. "
good,"customers are awesome, and always had great stories for why they are shipping. The management was not the best. I did not receive training. Bullying took place when I could not do certain things I was not trained on."
good,A very slow store to work at. Not many customers come in to shop enough to make numbers and sales. Co-workers are for the most part nice. Management is ok. Not everyone works as a team and aren't always on the same page. The hardest part of the job is to make your sales.  The most enjoyable is meeting nice customers and making their experience shopping with you a good one.
good,"Dillard's is a good company to work for overall."
good,"competition of sales among the employees. This is all.Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"Dillard's was a nice place to work, easy to get sales, although the toughest part of the job was getting yours hours cut because management over staffed."
good,"Working for Dillard's Direct was an interesting experience.  The job itself, while not difficult, was made more difficult by the lack of fulfillment the job provided.  A promotion included the addition of duties, while still having to perform the duties of the entry level position (at least in my personal experience), with no pay increase.  This made my experience unpleasant, as I wasn't able to succeed in my newly assigned promotion.  Without being able to do the elevated duties properly, all work suffered.  Simply a case of being spread too thin.  The staff and management were wonderful people.  The job just simply felt like a stepping stone, or temporary job, for someone searching for something meaningful."
good,"Dillard's is an interesting place to work. There are many advantages to working in an established retail environment, such as an established customer base."
good,"You sell merch to customers, and you earn your keep based on your sales, regarding if business is slow or fast."
good,"It was a fast paced environment but the requirements set by management was very hard to achieve with all the other employees working at the same time. For the total sales goal for the day, split up between employees, it was not nearly possible to achieve the personal goals for the designated areas."
good,"typical day requires opening registers, making sure area is clean, make monthly sales, and work retail hours, remember retail is about the details."
good,This company is an average place to work. You get an hour for lunch. Most everyone who works there is nice. Some days you will be scheduled a 11am to 9:15pm shift or 12am to 9:15pm once or twice a week which makes for a very long day. You never have a set schedule. The managers do work well with you when you need off or needing different days off for school or personal reasons.
good,Its alright. Extremely dedicated to customer service. No matter what it takes. Since its at the mall all they care about are the sales. Even if its completely dead they still expect you to make your quota
good,"The atmosphere would be a lot better, if associated didn't have to compete for sales. Once you earn your pay you should never loose it   ."
good,"while Dillards pays really well they have a standard quota for every sales associate and if you are unable to meet the quota, no matter what the reasons, even if it is out of your control you will get fired."
good,"Be prepared to work, salary is tricky but good. Kind of like car salesman atmosphere. No room for advancement. Fun at times"
good,"The employees were amazing and have a lot of potential to do bigger and greater things, however due to the structure very difficult to advance. Although coaching/training was talked about, senior management did not coach up their managers and aid is achieving a higher level success."
good,"Fun and exciting working with customers, learning and sharing new trends, and products. Promotions and gratis times were especially fun for both customers and beauty advisors. Training sessions were very rewarding, in addition to cosmetic trends advisors learned the skin care and health side of the business."
good,"My job can be interesting. Its nice working with customers and assisting them. What i do at work is keep the store clean, so customers can find what they need. Set up our promotions. I do wish we had a type of security."
good,"Days vary by events and visits. Corporate visits often and these visits cause a lot of stress. Upper management is picky and strict. "
good,"Not a huge fan of Dillard's, Management doesnt really work with you as much , and they are all about numbers, they do pay very well which is why alot of people stay there as long as they do."
good,"I was an assistant manager, I dealt with employees and customers on a daily basis. The company demanded a lot of hours especially during the holidays. Hardest part was pleasing the customers who were in there to get free merchandise"
good,"Everyday my job is different, why i say that is because i meet new people each day. You engage with customers and give them great customer service so they can come back to see you. I'm In Clinique so this consist of selling and doing make up. I enjoy what i do and appreciate my coworkers because we help each other with our sales.  The hardest part of my job will be when the business is slow and there's hardly customer's in and we have to make our quota. But besides that with a positive attitude you can make it."
good,When you work at Dillard's you have to sell so much per hour - but they have no customers coming in.  You get minuses your sales goal if someone returns something and there is a lot of turn over.
good,"the job is challenging and stressful ..but can be rewarding when you can see positive results daily, monthly,yearly. "
good,"People seemed nice at first, but they really are shady! dock manager would talk about the his employees behind their back. When addressing the manager of the overall store, she seem to NEVER have time, regardless of what, and was rude to some of the retail associates on the floor."
good,I wish to have a steady work place i was at an outlet store that kept having budget cuts the store had an overall awful enviornment
good,"A typical day at Dillard's includes me working in customer service area for a whole day or to transfer to the floor  and maintaining my area. There were also opportunities to help other departments because of the shortage of employees. Customer service includes handling purchases, creating mail orders, helping with problems, answering the phone and directing the calls to the correct extension. While working in the customer service area we were required to wrap gifts also. This was a great and fun experience working in that area. I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge from my co-workers."
good,"Mostly self training and 10 to 12 hour days.  Some weeks working 6 to 7 days a week.  Discount for employees is great.  Management of over 100 employees including the overall operation of the store.  Drive sales, manage security, cash deposits as well as receiving and dock."
good,"There was no clear direction for employees from management, inconsistent hours. No real chain of command, and there was room for promotion in the company."
good,"If one does not have a strong sales, interpersonal communication skills, Dillard's can be a difficult place to work. "
good,"I've currently been employed for almost 3 years. It is my stepping stool for working while in college. I was in a commissioned area. The pay is well worth the hassle. The only downfall is the life balances. In my store, we only get one weekend off a month ,and this is if we meet the quota of credit applications. "
good,"As an area sales manager, my primary responsibility is actively managing my sales associates duties including attaining daily sales quotas, organizing freight, and delivering 5 star service to each and every customer. As a company, I felt that I was not given an opportunity to completely understand or receive training required for daily operating of my business. In an effort to successfully manage my duties on a daily basis and attain my company's expectations, I had to seek out knowledge in place of what I had no prior training on. Many of my co-workers enjoy what they do, positions ranging from sales associates, business managers, to area managers and store management. The most enjoyable part of my job is receiving feedback from my peers and customers regarding customer service, merchandise selection, product knowledge, and follow-ups. Throughout my job experience in this position, I have acquired significant knowledge in how to manage people, whether they be sales associates or customers, develop skills in areas of learning development that are lacking, excel good selling behaviors, and productively manage priorities both on a daily and big picture scale."
good,At this job you will get a lot of social skills. you get to conversat with many propple
good,"Business is SLOW. You can keep your job based on your sales, no sales? No job. Which leads to employees ""stealing"" customers/sales that you have been working for. The management does not care about you or your fellow employees. They care about numbers. you'll get a review every few months. You are basically guaranteed a job for about 6 months and then if your numbers aren't up, you're out of there."
good,"A typical day of working a dillards was checking your quota for the day to make sure how much you needed to sale that day and if there wasn't any costumers when you got there you would straighten up and recover the area if needed. I would greet people as they passed by and help costumers find what they were looking for, I learned how to sell a lot, I learned how to be very persuasive and how to carry on a conversation with our customers and I always made sure to give them a good shopping experience. Management was probably the worst, I've never worked at a place where they yell at you for stopping someone from stealing, they would always look at everything negative and never even smiled at you. They treated us like complete robots while they just walked around doing nothing. We would page them when we couldn't figure out a solution for one of our customers in the system, they would be angry and not help us at all. The hardest part was definitely dealing with out managers, all of the co- workers would get along and we would always help each other meet our quota for the day. I build a lot of friendships at Dillard's we would make the best out of work even if everyone was in a bad mood. The part i mos enojoyed about working was helping the customers you kind of got to know a little bit about them as they shopped and they were always so nice and kind. I loved to reorganize as well because your department could look just as you would want it to and i loved to do that."
good,"During a typical day, handling incoming new merchandise, sizing and making tickets and getting inventory setup on floor.  Helping and listening to customers needs and desires.  Training new sales personal.   Setting up suits for alterations for customers."
good,"This employer has given us the task of making high sales numbers in a area where business is declining and we are pressured to meet these numbers but cannot leave he building to go inside the mall and recruit customers, the management is set on sales and pressuring us at getting customers. the hardest part of the job is trying to get customers to buy the product I was selling simply for the  fact the majority of the people that walked in the store are elderly people who do not care for fragrances which is what I was assigned to sell. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and how we got along and did events to try to get new customers to walk in the doors and get them to buy our merchandise and another enjoyable part is interacting with my loyal customers who will continue to come back."
good,it was flexible hours and great customer service. you can get more hours during the holidays .
good,"Attained most of my cash handling experience here, and also learned about different types of customers and how to interact with them. Some moments were challenging, but I learned from it and took the experiences I gained to my future positions."
good,"The pay at Dillards can be great - the struggle is keeping it. If you start at $10/hr, in 3 months you could be making 15% more. Then 15% more than that at the next review period (3 more months, then yearly), or at each promotion. But, only IF you meet your sales goal at the end of those review periods. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of opening the registers, and check fitting rooms for merchandise left from the previous night. When a customer would approach for assistance, I would then proceed to help them with their needs while making alternate suggestions. In the down-time, I would merchandise the department. I made sure shipment was properly put away as well as dressing the mannequins. I would have to say that merchandising and personal shopping was the best part of the job. I enjoy making people feel good about themselves."
good,Store closed because not enough buisness. was unable to meet quotas
good,Very pleasant customers and co-workers. Pleasant and clean  surroundings. Products are high quality and easy to sell. Training was left to the kindness of associates. Management unable to assist in any training. Overly staffed so associates unable to make SPH. All advertising was from associates. No television or radio advertising. Very low traffic. No coupons or sales so many customers would go to store that had better deals.
good,"Weekdays are generally slow, busier on weekends.  Working in the cash office allows me insight into the store's daily overall business.  The cash office includes basic bookkeeping, data entry, and simple paperwork and filing.  The customer service aspect allows direct engagement with customers who are generally pleasant to work with.  The co-workers are all wonderful, friendly and hardworking, although more focused on individual sales goals than teamwork.  Management runs the gamut.  Some managers are great, on top of things, assertive, and helpful.  Others are ineffective, difficult, and prone to micromanagement."
good,"The hardest part of the job was meeting your quota every month.  Your pay was determined by your selling performance.  If you met your quota by the time of your review, you could get a raise.  If you did not, there was the possibility of a pay decrease."
good,Merchandising in the morning but no matter what always customer servicing.
good,I had great opportunity to meet new people and learn about new product  to help with different needs. The hardest part of this job was sometimes not having enough stock.
good,working within this company provides a variety of things to do. It's mainly based on sales in order to keep your job so performance is key. Co workers are team oriented and provide a fun environment and engage customers. The hardest part of the job is maintaining an average sales amount per hour.
good,"When you can get the management to work with you it can be very exciting and rewarding knowing you are stopping people from taking things that do not belong to them , just hard at times to get management to follow up on trespassing warrants they will let people back into the store after they have been trespassed in hopes of getting a sale out of them !"
good,"This is the only place that I have worked that will actually cut your pay if you do not like your numbers.  It may not even be that you are not hitting your numbers but, regardless, they will cut your hourly.  And the benefits weren't that great."
good,"Dillard's is a nice place to work, but some of the associates aren't that friendly, but you learn to work around it."
good,"I would not recommend working for Dillard's.  I worked with them on and off for 10 years.  Their management ideals have changed, creating a hostile work environment."
good,"Great work hours on holiday season, fast past work place. Awesome coworkers but management is unstable with decision make to employees."
good,"Working at Dillards it is very important you are making your sales. We are always contacting our previous clients and gaining new ones, building relationships so we can continue to have these people come back and shop with us. Dillards does not play about making your daily sales goals, so it does get very competative in the work place. The most enjoyable part of my job is building relationships with my costumers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with management constantly changing what it is they want, and what it is they don't want. Ive noticed in this enviroment, they dont do what needs to be done until it needs to be done, therefor creating a lot of mental and physical stress."
good,"Dillard's is an okay place to work if you want to be bored. There is an attitude of ""we're better then everyone else"". It is true that they have an excellent selection of merchandise but they don't seem to care if it doesn't sell. I remember hearing a manager say that their selection was so good that they didn't have to have sales. I guess that's why the competitor, Macy's outsold all of the Dillard's stores in our area in just one store."
good,"Dillards is a very beautiful work environment. It is a very displined corporation. There were limited opportunities for advancement. A typical day at work involves assisting customers,setting up displays, and assisting customers with check-outs."
good,"I learned that sales is the most important thing. Maximize customer relations and maximize profits. It's a fast paced environment and you have to stay alert. Things are changing constantly from trends, styles, seasons, and the workplace around you. With room for growth it's all how much you put into it that will determine how far you succeed."
good,Typical big box retail environment where there was little or no creatiity or ability to advance. Thestore closed after only a few years in Greeley.
good,"Working for Dillard's was a confidence booster. It allows you to react outside of your comfort zone. What I took from working with Dillard's was how to balance out working with more than one or two customers while satisfying them at the same time. My manager was great, however, there was a new one ever three months. My co- workers, or ""shark eaters"" was the name, were extremely competitive. The hardest part of the job as keeping up with an unrealistic quota everyday, and the enjoyable part of the job was creating a relationship with the customers, especially the card holder (customers the had Dillard's credit cards)."
good,Hard to keep up with sales per hour.  Pins you against your coworkers.
good,"I thank Dillard's for the opportunity. A tipical day at dillards is no traffic of custumers and a lot of pressure in selling and making your numbers.  the cosmetic manager is really good works very hard to makes the work center a nice place to work.  I have learn so much in the cosmetic area, and enjoy when costumers leave very happy with the help and advise i provide them. like in everyplace there is good and helpfull co-workers and there is some that like to make problems but the main idea is to ignore that people and focus in the job."
good,Working with public to provide skincare needs. Analyzing and suggesting products. Makeovers. Competitive atmosphere. Constant pressure to sell.
good,Answered muliple phone lines.
good,"A typical morning working at Dillard's would start with counting the register before the store opens and double checking my work area is clean and orderly. Once the doors open then I engaged with every guest. I learned a lot about multi-tasking as it is an imperative quality due to the need to keep up my sales quota and to maintain clean work stations and a clean and orderly shopping environment for the guests. I was not a commisioned sales person, but I did have daily, weekly, and monthly sales goals and quotas that I had to achieve. If one acheives their sales goals then there are oppurtunites to advance and be rewarded with pay raises, in which case then the sales goals increase. However, if sales goals are not acheived then one's pay gets reduced and eventually will be terminated if unable to obtain necessary sales goals."
good,"We would go in basically to attend the customers and help them out with sales. We had a ridiculous quota in which we had to sell or get terminated. I had to sell $120.00 an hour, which is basically impossible, so I was terminated. The hardest part of the job was selling and some customers didn't want to be helped."
good,"Depending on the season, sales were great but when the off season came along, it was difficult to make numbers. Also the pay wasnt as good as i would like."
good,Good place to work but you really have to be a go-getter in order to sell enough to meet quota.
good,It was a good job. Pay was not what I was looking for because of the 45 min commute. The job didnt require too much and if I had the chance I'd go back and work there again!
good,I approached and greeted customers. I helped them find their size or colors that they wanted. I rang up the customer. I would display new merchandise on shelves or racks. I also folded neatly the men's apparel and accessories. I counted money in the register at the end of the night and turned it in to customer service. This job is great if you're single and do not have kids or are in college with no kids. It was a fun job!
good,"Productive, clean and organized, team work the hardest part of the day is that the days are not the same there is always something new or somethings that have to get completed."
good,"Tremendous opportunities for workplace education and growth though professional relationships. Advancement allowed me to learn and be trained in a variety of human resource aspects as well as sourcing and product development. Inventory managment and visual presentation as well as marketing, advertising and grass roots opportunities were in abundance. If you are willing to learn and be self taught by experiance and observation Dillards is a wealth of knowledge, if you expect someone to teach you these things then it is not the right place for you. Management expects you to figure it out for yourself in most cases."
good,I did not care for the new management! It is a good paying retail job with good benefits but the new managers wouldnt hire new department managers from within so there wasn't a way to move up to becone a department manager!
good,"Not a hard job in theory, but what made it hard was the extremely ridiculous sales goals that were given to you as an individual. No real opportunity for advancement unless you knew someone and pay cuts were a regular topic if you weren't making those goals."
good,"a typical day at work would start projects immediately, Did it in a timely manor, as for management they were fair sometimes, the co- workers i worked with were unprofessional, didn't have manners. The hardest part of my job i would have to say is achieving unrealistic sales goals through the week.The most enjoyable part of my job i would say was when we had promotional events andsales throughout the store."
good,"My typical day will be to come into work, check was items need to be priced reduced or placed on clearance rack,and help customers with their purchasing needs."
good,"I first started working at a store in Las Vegas, NV. Absolutely loved the experience there from management to customers. Everyone did there jobs and was trained correctly. Management was strict yet professional. My experience with Dillard's in Sandy, UT is the complete opposite. I have been transferred to multiple departments with no reasons. Management is too relaxed here, they do what they please. My manager hardly spends longer than 10 minutes in a typical day. The hardest part of my current positions is obtaining credit apps, we are constantly told to ask customers. If we don't get more than 4 apps a month, we are written up. Sales is also an issue when you have six coworkers competing on the slowest day of week. The most enjoyable part of my current position is assisting customers and knowing that I've been able to make their day easier."
good,"Dillards Inc. works a slow pace, but over all is a good company. Although the position does not have job security, it is a nice place to work at."
good,Nice place to work however you must maintain a high standard of sales.
good,There are good benefits and competitive work environment.
good,"You couldnt grow on the company. The quotas are high, but archivable if you have a great customer service skills."
good,"Good place while in college. Teaches you sales if you teach yourself. Relaxed, fun and social. 94 characters for now, 150 character minimum. Getting there. I'm here."
good,"A typical day of work was each department making goals and individuals and departments trying to meet daily goals. My departments goal was to keep the store and organized and operational as possible. Department manager was great in communicating with each worker. Department manager was also good at building relationships through the department  to further understand workers to complete a common goal. "
good,Not a bad place to work for a little while. Not really a career place but a nice place to get your feet wet in sales. Very competitive. You are responsible for stocking and maintaining a certain section
good,"Dillard's is a great professional organization that emphasize on growth and leadership. Additionally, employees can get full benefits as applicable by company policies."
good,I was in a commissioned sales position and was held to crazy standards. They would dock pay and cut hours if you didn’t meet quota. You are given little to no chances to redeem yourself if you do fall under quota and are never allowed to transfer to different departments. In the time I spent there only 1 person was promoted and many were fired or forced to resign. The entire store is just a revolving door of employees.
good,"I came into a mess in my department.  I know why .... past managers have run the department down.  It is like trying to resurrect the Titanic.  No room for growth or support from upper management.  I was thrown in, hardly any training and expected to meet certain goals with not much staff.  I can't get anyone who wants to work in this department due to alot of employees had horrible experiences with management."
good,the Management was unorganized and store was messy. Too much work for little pay . you had to make sales or you got a pay cut . The job was not worth it.
good,They pay is wonderful. One of the highest pay jobs in my city. Is definitely the best place I have worked at. Very inviting environment and great people.
good,Dillard’s does not care how hard an employee works how much they care about customer service hie loyal an employee is. The company on cares if you make your sales per hour goal. This company has high turn over in employees because if you do not meet that sales hail they let you go. It is very hard when co workers will lie cheat and steal your customers to get there sale. They are even argumentative in front of customer. Upper management keeps the bad and gets rid of good employees
good,I’ve enjoyed my experience at Dillards. I’ve learned about sales and proper customer care. Dillards is a competitive work environment. I recommend this job to anyone who is goal oriented and has good communication skills. The downside is scheduling and a lack of consistency from certain managers. The store manager is wonderful and i truly believe cares about the betterment of the company and employees.
good,"Although being a great experience , working for a company that does not see their employees worth, affects the desire for an employee to work the job ."
good,"Working at Dillards was a fun job, allowed me to enhance my social skills and interacting on a daily basis helping customers of all ages and ethnicities."
good,"I was told by my dept. manager that i would be placed in mens working in suiting area, but instead put into area that not many customers gravitated to unless there was a sale...consequently, i struggled to make sales quota"
good,"I learned a lot ,meet a great people , the job is not stable if you are not making sales , you may see you salary go down , lay-off if you are not making the goal after 6 months "
good,"switching schedules was inconvinient for a single mom situation, call system was ineffective at times, in my preference it will have help to have the same schedule and yes flexible to changes if other coworkers need it support or covering others coworkers shifts however in my case it was inconvenient switching shifts as I am single mom with little ones"
good,"Flexible hours, paid holiday, vacation pay. All available for full and part time employees. Helpful management. Advancement opportunity are available for sales position"
good,"The large problem with Dillard's is upper management. It's a great fall back job. The pay is probably the best found in Tucson if you have no job experience. Management hires a lot of young people because either they become lifers because the pay is high for Tucson, or they know they can hire easily because of their pay rate. Upper management isn't concerned with their employees. They're concerned with their numbers and their jobs only."
good,I loved working there the first year or so then management started picking favorites and having double standards. I loved the people I directly worked with but they need new managers.
good,normal retail work and management no overtime or benefits offered i started as part time and stayed for a while however i did not see any room for advancement and pay would top out at 10.00 for management
good,"No job security. If u don’t met unrealistic goals they give pay cut or fire you. Rarely has customers in store. Schedules are always messed up and no kind of structure. Great pay, ok benefits!"
good,Busy there's always something to do even in the slowest day you can fine something to do they always hiring people all year they always need employees
good,"i was sick of retail so i left. while i was in college this was a good job for me. but as i got older, compensation was to hard to live on as an adult."
good,"I think everyone should work at Dillards once and you would never go back to work at retail Dillards does not care about their employees."
good,The atmosphere was extremely competitive. The management style did not promote confidence in job security. Policy was not completely explained unless broken.
good,"The people are great! I enjoy the good and bad days! It’s very fast paced, everyone is always very involved, love how passionate they are about the customers"
good,"Learning experience was good."
good,This job was not what I expected. The pay was low for all the work we had to do and the incentives was not no better either. And the hours was limited.
good,"Working in sales can be fun, but stressful as well. Dillard's requires their employees to meet quotas and open credit cards. If you do not make your numbers then you can get fired. The co-workers are great but it can be very stressful at times."
good,"ALTHOUGH that job was tons of fun because of some of my coworkers, the management threatened to fire everyone every day. The department in shoes isn’t busy enough to sell $1500 every day but if you didn’t youbgot in trouble. My department manager was awesome but the store manager and assistant store manager were mean and didn’t care about their employees barley bothering to learn our names."
good,"Overall, it was not the worst job that I had, but it was for sure long hours on your feet. If you are not comfortable talking to customers, then maybe no the job for you. Managers are nice, but can sometimes be unprofessional and use company time to hang out and chat. But, overall, a good place to work if you really need it."
good,Stressful because we have to meet our sales goal. Otherwise we are going to have a pay cut . But I stayed with the co. For 13 years. I had high and low time with them .
good,"Dillard’s was a good job. I loved the discounts and the team was like a family, there was animosity and there’s love. You must be ready to help the customers and sell to them if you want to keep hours."
good,Dillards pays a lot better than other places  and they work around your schedule. Great part time job for students. The management is kind of bad because the communication is bad.
good,"It was a nice place to work, it is easy to get a job they give everybody an opportunity to interview with them and work there. If you get a job there just be on time and don't make any excuses you will last long."
good,"To work here you have to have an open availability to succeed. You have to be ready for visits from the owners, schedule changes, management changes. The best part is helping customers find what they need."
good,"Working at Dillard's has been a really great experience for me. Every associate dresses for success, and achieve every success through their own effort."
good,"Good paying job, however most employees are temporary due to impossible sales quotes. If you do not make sales goal by your review date (every 3 months) you will be let go."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, but they have unrealistic sales goals that is impossible to maintain.  There was little help from management for problems or concerns.  I enjoyed the employer discounts."
good,it used to be a positive atmosphere and i used to love to work at dullards but their management is changing to the worse and their organization is not there.
good,"They expect you to work all the time, and wont give you time off if you need to do something important if you haven't earned paid time off. Its pretty ridiculous"
good,I loved the store didn't like culture or what management allowed. It starts at the top and if the company wasn't so greedy it would be a nice play to work for. Don't participate in 401k you will get screwed.
good,"I learned how important it is to work as a team, for example when one associate is on vacation or off it is crucial that we associates that are working take care of the department. It’s east for one area to become a mess when customers are shopping so staying on top of recovery is a must."
good,Good place to work you can honestly do whatever you want. The sales goals are high but  just try and if you don't reach them it's really not your fault because I'm sure management cant make those sales goals either
good,"Great pay, good benefits. Does not work with outside life schedule. Management needs work. They tend to point out everything you do wrong and doesn’t promote what you do right."
good,Dillard's is one of the premier stores to work for. Fantastic training and product knowledge. Work pace is very good and has a great culture to work with.
good,"Fair job,fair pay, and Employee discount.You can meet good co-worker and helpful employee.The holiday season is busiest time of the year and there is a lot of work to be done"
good,I worked in the cosmetic area and it was very informative.  keeping the sale numbers was very hard because there are so many employees assigned to the same areas.
good,It was almost impossible to reach sales quotas the way the company set criteria. Management was bias. My supervisor was not consistent in the instructions and training to each employee. She was always changing them for each employee.
good,"The culture at Dillards is archaic. They have not moved away from what they began with fifty plus years ago. The sales expectations create hostility in slower stores, and this could be alleviated by a shifting in their archaic methods. "
good,The pay raise system is per associate sales in any given month. This system forces the associates to be unforgiving in regards to customer care. Many associates become shrewd and unfriendly when no potential customers are around.
good,"The hardest part of the job is trying to keep it. You have to compete with coworkers and maintain your sanity in a pool of petty people. Management doesn't ease the tension. They only care about the almighty dollar, but the store is suffering from the riffs among workers. The climate at this job is horrible. I have never worked with a group of people that I can't stand. I cringe every time I have to go to work. The hours are also ridiculous and they spread coverage weirdly. The Dillard family needs to reconsider some things if they plan to progress in a business where brick and mortar stores are going out of business. I've watched too many of my coworkers argue in front of customers. I've personally experienced having a customer ask me to check her out and saying no one helped her only to have my coworker swoop in and aggressively tell the customer she was helping her. How do you argue with someone that you were helping her? The sales quotas make people forget their manners and common decency."
good,"Your tasked with bringing up stock, setting up floor displays, organizing area, stocking the floor, and assisting customers while maintaining your sales goals. Sales goals can be hard to meet and some employees get cut throat will sells. Management will push getting people to sign up for Dillard's cards on you heavily."
good,Great people to work around and have fun with as long as you get your work done. Many people like to shop there and the store is kept clean. Great sale.
good,This position was part time for me because my children were in school.  This position was transferred for me from Lawton OK to Colonial Heights VA.  Did not offer full time employment
good,"I loved my overall time working at Dillard's. Working closely with customers and co-workers was something I highly enjoyed. "
good,job was forced to get credit apps. from customers. while we only were awarded $2 per app. on our paychecks. Great pay schedule and start out rates not bad. Shopping discounts not bad.
good,Shifts can often be longer than 8 hours. After a Two week training period you are put into a department without any input on where you would like to be placed. If you ever wish to transfer departments it is a extremely long process and you could end up not even getting approved for the transfer.  The managers are often hard to get ahold of if you need them. The overall job is not bad at all and the pay is good for what you do. It just needs to be better managed to reach its full potential
good,I really do enjoy warehouse work especially when the management comes together and they're on the same page but at dealers a lot of them was on a different page and is an any company favoritism is a key role of why people don't want to stay and joyed the job I did and I would love to have it back Oneday or something similar to it
good,"team work is always helpful , great cosmetics manger always willing to help you and the customer ."
good,"Above average retail pay when compared to other similar stores. You must sell a minimum amount of merchandise. If not, your pay will be cut. You can end up with cut throat employees who will steal sales or block your sales in order to make their quotas."
good,"Everyday I set a sales goal for myself .I have been there 15 yrs so I can do every thing on my own sales,merchandising .Management is weak. Commision is stressful hardest part of the job. Making your sales goal most enjoyable part of job,meeting your challenges."
good,"Working at Dillard's was a lot of fun most of the time. It could get stressful at time, but it was a good challenge and I loved my coworkers. The pay was fair."
good,LOved helping people and going out of my to make sure every customer left happy and come back the same.I won a few awards for the most sales which made me very happy.I liked the discounts on the items in the store.
good,Hard to make numbers when there were no customers in the store. Management tried to help you make numbers but could not magically produce shoppers. No commission.
good,"If you have a vast background in sales, you'd think this would be an enjoyable place to work, and you'd be wrong. They lure you in with the higher than average payrate, but stick you in a department you know nothing about, no matter what your previous experience entails, work you like a slave and expect you to meet ridiculous sales goals considering your department is overcrowded and not everyone is pulling their weight regarding department duties. And if you don't meet your sales goals for consecutive quarters, they cut your pay and you can't get full-time hours."
good,"The job was very low key , I loved it. the reason"
good,"Fast pace , great for strong willed and hard working people who love to exceed goals no matter the time and dedication. I loved it but not at the cost of my family life."
good,Coworkers see each other as enemies because of the quotas .... they steel sales from each other. The company gives 25% employee discount and they offer great sales.
good,Great environment to work if you like high pressure sales and your peers potentially stealing your customers.  Must meet a quota and maintain in order to get a raise.
good,"it was a good company but at the same time managment played favorites and such. i felt over worked half the time and even when i did really good on a sale or in sales there wasn't a lot of support since i wasn't a ""favorite"""
good,great pay but the management is very bad. you work on quotas that are unachievable and unrealistic. for a college student looking to make a good pay. must be a good sales person.
good,"A lot of the clothing would stay on the racks for far too long. By the time they made it to clearance, they would be out of style. Also, many times you had to race to the register to earn your quota for the month. Even if you were helping a customer, some of the sales people would camp out near a register in hopes of stealing your sale so that they could advance quicker."
good,It was a good temporary work place when me and my family moved here Pensacola but I would not like to work a retail  job at this time in my life. I would probably do it as a PT job if it is necessary.
good,"Room for advancement, I've seen it first hand. Also, Company has its up's and downs also. Some days it'll be an ok environment and the next it could be something totally different"
good,The one thing I didn't like about Dillards was the quotas. It really depended on what department you were assigned to as to if you made your sales goals. If you were in an area that was in the back or out of the way you didn't stand a chance.
good,"Very fast paced work environment. Advancement not very great, management is okay. Upper managers don't care to even shake your hand. Okay benefits and hours."
good,"Fun atmosphere but very stressful. I was able to move up a lot in 6 years, but because I can't move for another 6, they will not promote me further at this time. I love the people I work with for the most part. The hardest part is convincing your associates that they are going to survive the slow season."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning up after customers and shoving product suggestions in their faces.  It is a cut-throat environment which has no potential for teamwork.  Compensation is based on sales after a review period, and commission pertains only for certain positions.  The management is easy going, sometimes too much.  If there are issues with other employees, expect them to go unresolved by management."
good,"Working at Dillards was not that bad. It was the fact that they did not consider your schedule so you would work at times you said you weren't available. Also, the sales goals was impossible to reach some days. I was at a very slow location so it could be really challenging."
good,These people will work you like a dog. The money is good if you are healthy enough to keep up with the demanding work pace. Little support from management.
good,"Working in beauty often means working behind a counter or two, but commission based sales made everything so competitive it almost felt toxic, to the point that my job made me depressed. Not to mention, Dillard's isn't necessarily THE place to go to for cosmetics - larger beauty retailers made it difficult to thrive. Why would somebody come to my counter to buy X brand when they could browse Sephora for the same? I liked the responsibility of running the show at my own counter, but it was hard to sell when I didn't see customers in cosmetics for hours on end. I did have the luxury of 2-3 days off per week though."
good,"Having a Entrepreneurial mindset and approach to growing a customer base"
good,I enjoy working at Dillard's. I am able to learn alot about retail and how it works. I have a great manager who is willing to work with me and my hetic schedule due to school.
good,Had good co workers not enough hours and needs better management have your sales quota too high to see so in the down season they fire you if you don't meet your sales quota
good,It was such a good experience for me working in retailers for the very first time. But I don't like how my manager treated us very unprofessional.  They should hire a manager that has positive attitude towards customers and staff.
good,Retail is very hard to handle.  Department Manager is without experience in handling employees and has a huge turnover.  Watched very good employees leave because of this individual.
good,Dillards is a good company. It does have alot of problems in it as most jobs do. It is a company I would work for again but advancement is hard to come by at this company.
good,"Overall a pretty good place to work, but it is hard to make sales goals in a small store/ college town. I worked in lady's shoes and it was very hard to get out of deficit/ make sales goals but during holiday season."
good,No complaints really just wish I had more hours money is very good multi cultural and all around pretty nice I work with some really nice people that care about what they do
good,Company very hard to work for. Very goal oriented and hard to meet quotas with low turnout of customers. Enjoyed working with other employees though...
good,Dillard's was good with setting clear goals and knowing what to expect on a day to day  basis.  As far as as a company the benefits and hours were okay with understanding management.
good,"Greeted customers and assisted with purchases by making recommendations based on individual customer needs, processed credit card applications Accepted and processed backorders and “Merchandise-in-Demand” orders over the phone for internal and external customers. A fun place to work at if you don't mind cleaning up dressing rooms all day."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I loved the early start time and ending time. It was a challenge each day to be perfect in balancing the vault and 54 registers. Especially when you had associates who were not careful in giving back change. It was also very difficult dealing with the office secretary, I would need to leave the office to check on a register and she would resent having to cover the office. Also once the money part of the job was done I then had to work the customer service desk which was so very often boring. I had wished they had some kind of work I could have done while standing there waiting for a customer to need something. However, with that all said I still say Management was one of the best I've ever worked for."
good,"Typical day at work is high performance environment yet fun and motivational and best customer service !"
good,Typical mall job.  Management could be better.  They also should review their security measures.  The only way to get an employ discount was to apply for credit card.
good,"Working here helped me mostly with communication, you have different cultures, religions and backgrounds that enter daily where you find yourself using different methods to communicate and working on communication skills without even trying. Staff is very competitive but it only pushes you to be even more passionate about sales and not being overly aggressive."
good,"Negative environment"
good,"The corporate office dictates all the managers actions."
good,"I have enjoyed my job, but I am ready to enter into a new career giving back to my community. I am ready to put my time, experience and energy helping our youth improve their lives through education. I am ready to take on a new challenge. I feel I have gone as far as I want to in retail management."
good,"In the 7 years I worked for the company, it had its ups and downs. Most of the downs came from my immediate supervisor and nothing else. The company as a whole were very good to their employees."
good,"Typical day starts with a morning meeting recapping sales and credit performance. Some days are slow, but thoroughly assisting customers helps reach daily goals as well as build clientele."
good,"Overall, it was a a good experience. On a normal day we stayed busy and did not have to much down time. I had great coworkers, and the management was nice. However, it was a little difficult to do other things around our work schedule."
good,"Working on the dock at Dillard's, while considered one of the lesser rungs of the ladder, was by far the best place to be in the Dillard's workplace. As long as you came in on time, didn't goof off on the clock, and put a genuine effort into your work the environment was ideal. My manager was exceptionally knowledgeable about his job and my coworkers helped share most responsibilities. Being a support character working in the background to help others suits my character well. To hear customers, associates, and management say, ""I couldn't have done it without your help,"" made me feel like I was an integral part of a thriving business."
good,Dillards is a steady and conservative employer. I only have experience with their information technology department. It was a great experience especially for someone at an entry level position. They have a great training program that is the perfect transition from college to the real world.
good,"A typical day on the job would be excited and at times adventurous  because we often times have some customers that are very entertaining. The most strenuous part of the job would have been doing the stock reason being its could be time consuming and its a slow day, sales are down and we are trying to make commission and make the SPH. The most enjoyable about the job is being of service to the customers and seeing that they are very well satisfied and pleased with the service and merchandise"
good,I liked dillards overall; it has its pros and cons. Very sales driven and if you don't make the number you don't have a job.
good,Of course every place where you have to meet sales there is a bit of tension with co workers because you have to win customers over. It was a great experience to gain up sale experience
good,"Dillard's sets extremely high sales goals that you are required to meet to maintain your pay rate. If you do not maintain it you can get a pay cut of up to 25%. The plus to this is that you can also earn up to a 25% raise. In my store management played and obvious game of favorites. They treated their top sellers like royalty and the rest of the associates were nothing to them. In my year there I was ignored for help in advancement, denied a move from part to full time (even though my department was desperate for a full time person) and constantly talked down to by management that had no more experience than I. I even had a manager change my schedule and not tell me resulting in two days of no call/no shows and all she said was ""I forgot, oops"". This store NEEDS more experienced and unbiased managers."
good,"I learned a lot here. Be aggressive and make your daily sales goal (which is hard when there are no coupons to help out returning customers), or be kicked out. hardly anyone shops here, unless its a sales weekend (which is once a month) so most of your time will be spent standing around or chatting with other employees. the hardest part of the job is coping with the expectation to make $500-$1200 per day you are working there. and thats only for part time. if you are working full time, you have to sell alot more than $1000 per day. good luck and think about your options."
good,"I love my job at Dillards, the most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to interact and help my customers. Management is ok, though it is the main reason for my leaving."
good,"I have good interpersonal skills with customers as well as single highhandedly helped increase sales, great formal skills with the customers."
good,you have to basically fight for your sales because they give you a quota that you have to meet. its a competition among the other associates. it really is a hostile environment there.
good,"I worked in the women's shoe department and was able to make some good money through my base pay and commission from sales. The first 6 months I was part time then they hired me on full time. There were part time workers and a couple full time workers who were lazy, which is less competition in sales but causes the employees who really work to have to take up the slack with stockroom and salesfloor work, inventory auditing, and special projects; also our manager wouldn't discipline the lazy people but instead just made sure she gave the special projects to people she knew she could trust to do the work.  Though the selling could be competitive people were good about not stealing each other's sales for the most part. Another thing was that if you didn't get at least 1 person to apply for a store (Dillard's) credit card in a week you would get assigned an extra stock hour the next week which took away from your time on the salesfloor and ultimately from your commission. I personally think that they are sometimes to quick to hire people for that department and I know that they move people to that department that didn't want to be there using force and trickery at times. The base pay was 10.90/hr and once I started full time and  I made about an average of $300/mo commission. Working full time I made around $2,000/mo commission during the holiday season and about $100/mo commission during the summer months, that's when its the slowest, and when they have the clearance shoe racks out. Half the time throughout the year and also during the holiday season full time workers only got"
good,"I learned the way to get along with employees and management, and getting things done on times. I also learned how to chick in and out on times."
good,Associates are great and super helpful. Hardest part about the job is the slow days when no customers are in the store and don't want to buy anything.
good,"Typical work day for me would be counting cash drawers in the morning, selling clothing and putting up truck that we got in and making sure everyone is spoke to and helped with a friendly smile."
good,I've worked both in sales and as a security camera operator.  Definitely prefer the security camera operator position.  A lot of pressure put on sales associates to make sales.
good,everything was alright got along with everybody. management was OK not that great. the hardest part was that you had goals that you had to make every six months. The best thing was the sales and your discount .
good,"Dillards was a very fun, sometimes fast paced but management cannot keep the rules clear. The rules change from day to day."
good,Management could use improvement definitely. A title means nothing if you can not work to back it up. It depends on the dept.
good,I didn't like all the work you had to do that wasn't related to your pay.  You had to do all these things but the could fire you based on sales per hour.  I did enjoy my coworkers though.  Most people understood what it was and were cool people.  I did enjoy talking to people all day too.
good,"High end department store. Enjoyed clothing discount.  I  took job to fill in but eventually took better paying job when available."
good,"The quota is too high for current traffic. But benefits are good and pay is not bad. Generally the work is good, however the rules are not consistent."
good,"I have been employed at Dillard's for more than three years and experienced changes in management three times. Unfortunately, there is not many positive attributes to this job other than the employee discount towards clothing merchandise. I dislike how our schedules are processed (we do not know our lunch time until after we arrive to work), executes a closed door policy (any problems or concerns that I attempt to address are immediately disregarded with malice by the management), the hiring manager continues to discriminante aganist potential employees (she only hires people that look like her or speaks her language). A lot needs to be repaired here, before it can succeed in a fruitful buisness."
good,"It´s fun to work at Dillards. I like my co workers and being surrounded of customers and nice merchandise."
good,"Employees are often over worked and underpaid, especial the managers. Employees are not seen as valuable. Upper management has much room for improvement."
good,it was very competitive sales. it had a great discount and i guess that is the only reason i stayed. management in the brownsville tx was very uptight.
good,I helped people find shoes and figure out what size they were along with referring them to new styles and shoes that would fit the event or activity they would be doing.
good,"I was responsible for interviewing, hiring, and training of new associates. Responsible for reporting all building maintenance. Required to oversee that policies and procedures were followed by all associates. Really enjoyed the association I had with all associates. After I was hired I was told I would work 6 days a week. I was also told I would not have to worry about relocating, but then after hire, was told they would relocate me in one year. I could not do that as my husband was in the Army National Guard and could not relocate."
good,"I have really enjoyed working with all of the great associates. "
good,"It is a high stress environment, your sales determine whether or not your job is secured. The managers and co-workers would rather be gossip then worried about their jobs."
good,Very fast paced and can be a stressful environment.  I had a lot of great co-workers and met a lot of designers.  Overall a great experience.
good,"Hit or miss management, a lot of favoritism going around.  Stressful goals with no consideration for circumstances.  For example, and event had a particular goal, then the time of the event was cut in half but the expelled goal remained the same."
good,Management was not always concerned with fixing identified problems which hindered me from doing my job efficiently.
good,"Co workers are friendly and pretty easy to get along with. Dillard's is a great short term job. If you're looking for a great job to have for 1-2 years, it's a nice way to go. The sales goals are something that must be met. If only 2 people come into the entire store that day, you are still expected to meet your sales goals."
good,stressful worrying about your sales constantly and worrying about other people stealing your sales everyday and if you dont keep your sales up you get a pay deduction.
good,"It was a great place to work, I meet wonderful people at the different locations. I did learn a lot while I worked for Dillard's, the chain had some  problems after 9/11 and closed 125 stores then layoff. I went back to college after layoff."
good,Management in some departments lacks leadership and responsibility.
good,"A company where you can work and enjoy people, learned how to work sale per hour, management is very skillful , all co-workers work well together, the hardest part of the job is when there is not enough customer in the store to perform your job. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,If you are competitive person. This is a job for you! I'm learning a lot about how important is to have a good costumer service. Management they do best they can to help you day by day. Co- workers everybody is there to have there raise in the end of there year. The hard part of the job is very competitive invironment. See my costumers happy and feeling good.
good,"Participated in various incentive programs and contests designed to support achievement of"
good,"counting cash, cleaning dressing rooms, perfectly folding clothing, managing a sales quota."
good,"it was fairly simple, just in most cases favoritism and old business practices will bring dillards to its demise."
good,"A typical day involved greeting each and every customer and asking specific questions to figure out the customers needs or wants. While taking care of customers you are required to complete daily tasks such as handling new inventory and reconfiguring the sales floor according to directives and new inventory amount.  Also answering department phone calls and completing specific orders and locating items both on the internet and at other stores. My manager was great. She was friendly, encouraging, upbeat and did not play favorites.  The other department managers were much more cold and always had multiple personnel issues. The hardest part of the job was not the sales quota that you are expected to meet by the hour but the very competitive environment the store creates.  The sales techniques are designed to treat each customer as a number. Team work is completely out of the question working here.  Unfortunately it pays to be mean here."
good,"Good company, discount and people. Good for college students."
good,"Opening in the store, setting tone for the day, talking with staff about goals and any promotional events that were happening in the store.  As Management, made sure to supervise staff and coach on approaching customers in need of assistance."
good,Great place to work for young teens to develop work history and customer service experience.
good,Kept me busy with lots of tasks to get done each day. Just a little stressful with bad management.
good,"While working here, I've noticed that the only thing that matters in the store are sales.  The biggest problem with this is the managers do not care as to how you get the sales, so you have a lot of coworkers out to get you and your sales you were working on.  You have a quota to make for the day, while you should also be selling x amount per hour.  If you don't mind sales, you may not mind this jobs, but if you crack under pressure and don't like quotas, I wouldn't apply here. I've watched others come and go so fast, due to not making their sales, so just be wary if you're not the sales kind of person.  If you are, great! The pay is decent, no commission though (unless you are suites or shoes).  The management is a bit on the cruel side of the spectrum, it's almost as if they are looking for reasons to fire anyone.  So watch your back, trust no one."
good,Unfortunately this company has relocated and to this day I still miss my coworkers. They were great to be around.
good,Hardest part of the job is keeping up with your numbers. If you do not keep up with sales you become expendable.
good,"I worked briefly as a sales associate at Dillards Urban and Denim department. As I worked I was looking for another management position. The requirement of Dillards was to make the daily sales goal consistently or they would cut pay. However the store did not have the business to allow this to be possible and shortly after I left, the company closed down that store and condensed from 2 Dillards in the mall to one."
good,"If you work your tail off and make the sales goals, you will be okay."
good,"Dillard's is a good stepping stone. It helps build your character, your morale, and definitely thick skin. It takes a lot of dedication, and the employees are all go getters."
good,"It could be a busy day or really slow at times too."
good,"typical day was opening/closing of the store, training associates on merchandising and customer service. I enjoyed working with all of the employee. The hardest part was the micro- mananaging of the management which helped me how to handle and deal with pressure under a specific time frame."
good,"Typical days varied from day to evening shifts with most weekends part of my work schedule. I learned how to manage a busy department with up to 25 employees, working to meet sales goals while maintaining the check-in & merchandising of products."
good,"1. Focus on customers and cosmetic and skin care needs."
good,"Generally several tasks on the daily schedule to achieve, such as markdowns, merchandising, managing, selling, etc. Particular store has high turnover. I've learned to better deal with people in a department store setting. Hardest part about my job is selling and managing, Most enjoyable are my co workers."
good,"Meeting and greeting new and old clients."
good,"Just a mess! Want, Want, Want everything from you but not willing to give back. Use you up mentally, physically, spiritually, and still ask for more. Struggling retailer trying to hang on!"
good,I did Visual Displays all over the stores to make them look good.  It was fun but very hard heavy work.
good,The management of this place is a joke. They show favoritism to certain employees and will believe anything say over the rest of the employees. My co-workers were the best group of guys you could imagine. Always willing to help a fellow employee out. The most enjoyable part of my job were my colleagues.
good,I enjoyed the personal relationships I acquired with the customers that came into the store.
good,"Having worked for Dillards for 7 years it gave me the skills I needed to provide excellent customer service while going above and beyond. It does, however, sadden me that management at this location has not shown the same quality of service to their employees."
good,"Greeting Customer, Find out how can I & what are there needs Providing product knowledge to the customer on standard merchandise, New Arrivals, Sale Promotion,"
good,"Enjoyed the co workers"
good,Working at Dillard's was a different experience. I learned about a lot of high end retail items and I learned how to really sell the items that were in the store. I also had to learn how to cope with other competitive associates who would go out their way to get a sale by any means necessary. Management was average. Some of the co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job at Dillard's was meeting my sales quota. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,You must meet sales goals to keep your job. Sometimes it does get pretty competitive. You must have a good eye for detail to restock and organize the sales floor. Dillard's is a good company overall to work for if you enjoy retail.
good,"It is a good job if you really enjoy interacting with different types of people and also enjoy a competitive selling environment. However,raises are solely given based on numbers. Failure to meet set goals results in pay cuts or termination. Dillard's is constantly changing policies making it very difficult to keep up with. There's plenty of opportunity to make lots of money but you must work hard and be very passionate about what you are doing."
good,Worked typically 8-5 weekdays and provide some 24/hr on call support at times.
good,"Customer service, coaching associates, processing freight, floor moves,"
good,"Overall it was a fine company. If you are one that enjoys your evenings and weekends at home with your family, this is not the job for you."
good,"Basic floor work, restocking, inventory, customer help, cleaning, and cashiering."
good,"This job was a great stepping stone to get some experience."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and helping customers.  The hardest part of the job dealing with other employees working in the same area.
good,I enjoyed working in the ladies shoes department since I love shoes!  The hours varied but I balanced it out.  My co workers were amazing.  I remember sticking around an associate who had been there for years and was able to learn so much from her.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the pain of being on your feet all day in heels!
good,"I loved working with designer clothes and costumer service, but I didn't get along with the staff very well.  The most enjoyable part of the day was bringing in new merchandise.  Fashion is very important to me."
good,"I had quite a few issues when I first started working at Dillard's in 2011, my mother was very ill and was consistantly in the hospital and having constant doctor visits, my manager was extremely understanding and was very flexiable with my work schedule."
good,I enjoyed working here and learning from some great managers and supervisors. Learned how to sell and show merchandise to people in a better and more efficient way.
good,Each day you assist customers and put up stock. An keeping your area organized. I learned to keep up with up with my customers and organizing the clothes in their groups. I worked with some good ones and bad ones. Competing with others with sales. Seeing sales that came out first.
good,"When we all started, they made it seem like we would have the opportunity to make around $15/hrly. Since they have started the Base Plus program, they keep changing the percentages that we make and they are making it very difficult for us to even make $11.50/hrly. Also, they hired quite a few people, but as soon as it got slower right before spring time, they started writing everyone up for every little thing just trying to get rid of a lot of people. The management is not experienced and can be unprofessional. I will say that I loved working for them for the first few months, but the management team treats us hard workers like children most of the time. They do not know how to speak to us with respect. Many have quite because of this."
good,"typical day includes doing your own markdowns, helping customers, cold calling, and management rarely doing anything to help you. Dillard's is the 2nd worst place to work for in the US and yet the CEO approval is lower than the worst place to work. Corporate thrives on an outdated business modal and only the southern stores are doing well. Don't waste your life on this place, they will cripple you and punish you for it."
good,it was alright. didn't like the sales goal. work hours were alright.
good,"Cleaning, stocking cases"
good,"Wish we didnt have sales per hour goals. Makes for an atmosphere of competition, can be hard"
good,"Dillard's was a very difficult company to work for. While I didn't mind so much working in a very fast paced environment with a lot of change, I feel most people wouldn't. Very High turnover rate in the company, and at times they expect you to make unattainable goals. Even though at the end of the day you truly felt you did your best, sometimes the management would quickly make you feel otherwise. The cosmetics counter I ran, however, was AMAZING! I loved the executive for the company and she always reassured me that she knew I was doing the best that I could, and that made you feel good. Great pay and benefits!"
good,Tooo much to put really. I didnt get a good time working there tho.
good,High sales pressure on sales associates. SPH As any sales position must help customers and maintain floor.
good,"*A typical day at work would consist of engaging into the customers, making sure the displays and fixtures were neat and presentable. Sometimes rearranging departments,helping or filling in other workers departments etc.Making sales,returns and money exchange within the store."
good,"I used to work for Dillard's from 1999-2000 as a Sale Associat in Greensboro, North Carolina and between 2001-2003 for Dillard's in Greenville, South Carolina. After all it was great to work for customers as well as associates.The most enjoyable part of the job was to make my sale's points and the hardest part sometimes was difficult to make a sale because there was not many customers."
good,"A typical day at work is really just unloading the flatbeds, putting new and or old items in their proper places, adjusting shelves for new product display, selling, approaching customers, 100% all about the customers, cleaning, dusting. Management was pretty terrible, they weren't very good at working with your schedule, ill mannered, did not treat their employees as equals, they break rules. I've learned to be more approachable on the plus side though, I used to be very to myself and shy, but having to approach complete strangers and what not really helped me open up a little. Now I have no problem speaking with strangers. Hardest part of the job was keeping cool, stress could come from all angles, co workers are very competitive and take sales when the opportunity strikes. Working with Dillard's was quite enjoyable though, meeting new people, customers, new co workers, and we got to sample new products."
good,"What I enjoy most about my job is working with the public. I enjoy helping others. I've learned a lot about merchandising my product and its history. The more I know about a product, the better it helps me to evaluate the customer's needs and to find the specific brand that best suits them."
good,it was great to work but I don't feel you can work your way up in these kind of organizations.
good,"The workday consists of watching short D-Tube Learnings to obtain/increase product knowledge, displaying new product per merchandising directives, performing markdowns, and taking care of customer's needs. In the lingerie department, this includes performing bra measurements and fittings, and helping customers to select bras.I have learned what a proper fitting bra is, and about different products. Management is very good about working with employees for requested days off. Other than that, Dillards is all about sales. Failure to meet sales quotas results in termination, oftentimes creating an environment that is not friendly and lacks teamwork. The benefits of sick pay are lacking, as the first day is not paid. This encourages employees to work while ill, and many take a second day just to be paid one day. Overall, the work itself is highly enjoyable. However, the company policies create a highly unstable employment environment that lacks support for growth and achievement."
good,Overall my men's manager was a family person and he worked well with you especially if you were responsible and dependable
good,"Great place to start earning work experience if you like to work with people. Depending on where you work, the managerial personalities will vary from a high likability factor to low. Overall this is a good place to work while furthering one's education."
good,I wish I would not have wasted 6 months of my life working here. I was constantly moving clothing and changing hkw it was displayed on a daily basis. It should have been described as a visual merchandising position
good,Dillard's competes on quality and has established a lasting presence in the retail market. They focus on constantly acquiring fresh brands to add value to their company for their consumers.
good,Depending on the dpt. worked it can be a very cutthroat job. The Dillards here in Alexandria seem to only care about themselves and not you. It is a good paying job that keeps money coming in weekly a very fast come up.
good,The turnover rate is extremely high. You have to learn everything basically on your own. It's a huge lack of communication and training. The pay is ridiculous for all the responsibilities that are required.
good,"The particular Dillard's store I worked for had an entire floor dedicated to the home department, but it was what caused a lot of confusion for customers. Many would come looking for the men's or kids department, completely unaware that they were on a different floor altogether. So most of the customer traffic that would come through didn't really want anything from the home department, and those that did, didn't purchase much. The sales goals would be stupid af, like they expected us get people to buy at least $3000-ish worth of stuff everyday. But with barely any actual customers looking for home stuff, not very many of us would reach those goals, and any returns also hurt the amounts we made for the day too, therefore making it harder to reach said goals."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others achieve a need. Customer service is big for me because I enjoy people. I enjoy helping others to make them feel good about themselves.
good,You can work very hard for this company and it probably will not matter. If you are unable to meet sales quotas for your department you will get a pay reduction or be fired. If you meet the sales quota you get a pay raise but you also have to keep increasing your sales. This is not easy to do when brick and mortar retail is on the decline. They will not adjust the quotas for economic declines or seasonal differentials and you have to work every holiday (except for Christmas day).
good,People can be nice. Management seems to be out of order. Employee turnover rate is high so that speaks for itself. Day to day operations are very routine. Workers and customers can be complicated at times. Ned to have the ability to be flexible with your schedule. Closing shifts are always needing covered. Wage is decent.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people and customers I work with. They bring a good attitude into the work space. Ive done a better job at customer service because of Dillard's.
good,did not like it. stressful job. long hours. the people that worked there did not help me. no training. would not recommend to anyone else. the pay was ok.
good,"Its not bad, it depends on your personality. Some people can make a lot of money, some people can't last. Lots of incentives to sell more, many raise and bonuses."
good,"Be willing to work very hard. Some days you have to work ten to twelve days without a off day, working in retail, that is too much strain on a person, especially during the holidays."
good,Coworkers were cool but i hated going into work everyday. Not a fun environment but talking to the other people there made it worth it for a little while
good,Great environment to work in. All associates get along. Great pay starting for retail. Great company to grow with. Become certified in specialized areas
good,"Familial illness  led to my resignation from the company. Left on great terms though with my boss. "
good,"Sales driven, customer service oriented environment. Strong focus on building the sale, as well as selling company credit card. The credit sale has become seemingly as important as selling the merchandise. Little incentive for customer to open an account, and little compensation for associate. "
good,This company accommodated my school schedule for 2 years and continue to help me with my busy life schedule. I believe it is a great place to work while you are trying to accomplish a higher goal.
good,"My time at Dillard’s was brief. But, for what it’s worth Is not a horrible place to work. Upper management is poor though and promotes unhealthy environment. Lots of “high school drama” amongst most management. A good starter job for someone looking to get their feet wet in sales and a very just do your job and go home without saying a word kind of place. Sales associate is the best position at this job, management is not. SPH is a little bit of a stretch but if  you are dedicated you can make it and make decent money. Worst thing here is the turnover rate which is directly related to management and company policy. Very outdated. Moved on to something better."
good,Dillards is a great job but the management could be a little better in my opinion. They are a bit unorganized and don't know how to treat their employees. Other than that the job is pretty easy and i love my coworkers and my department manager.
good,it was a really great experience. I just enjoy being a bit busier at work. they were really really slow in the summer and I dreaded going to work to just sit around
good,"I worked at Dillard's in Atlanta, Ga (Atlantic Station). Only thing I like was the pay was very decent for me. I got started off being paid $12 and ended with $14.20. They will work you to the bone. You have to make unrealistic quotas very month. You basically fighting over sales with your co-workers. Some co-workers will steal your sales if you are not watching them. One day you can exceed your quota and the next day you can get a bunch of returns and it could put you in the negative. You have 3, 6, and 12 month review. If you are in delinquent on your sales. be prepared to get a really big pay cut. If you are exceed your goals you can get a huge pay raise but your quota is going to be very unrealistic and you have to work extra hard for it. JANUARY 1st SALE is the worst day of all it is the biggest sale of the year and the store is a hot mess. It takes over a month to recover the whole entire store. Then on top of that there is inventory in that same month. There are days or even weeks that the store is very slow which make it hard to make your quota. Customers do not always know that the employees are working base off commission or sales. So it seem like to them that they are be hassle and feeling pressure to buy things. Dillard's customers love nothing put sales and barely wants to pay full price for anything. So you do have to push it on them a little. I left the place because i knew my sales wasn't as good like when i started. I did not want to get a pay cut."
good,Dillard's was an okay job. The pay was very good and it was part time. Could've gotten more hours would.ve been perfect. This job was also very competitive even though we was only getting paid by salary and not commission. And we had a sales target.
good,"Over the years I've built up a lot of expertise and experience in sales, for which I'm grateful.  The atmosphere is energetic and fun as well.  However the more you make, the higher your sales goal...and this goal is unreachable sometimes.  Management is powerless here and good people get a pay cut or let go due to this problem"
good,"Dillards set such a high standard for their employees to be able to keep their job. High sales goals, that makes other employees take sales from you. Expect you to keep your sales up, plus do markdowns, put mechanics out, clean mirrors, dust, clean fitting rooms, get a certain amount of new credit applications a week."
good,"Can be stressful, daily quota. review every year to see if you quota was met if not met then you would get a pay cut by 10%. If quota met you would get a raise by 10%. The following year if its your second time your quota isnt met then you would be terminated."
good,"I love working at Dillard’s the group lady I worked with were Awesome always came to work on time , work together as groups  and team I love meeting new people, Helping people for a special event a special day work interview whatever it might be."
good,"When I was first interviewed it was for a full time, management position. By my second interview (almost a month later) it was filled and all they had available was part time. After a month, I wanted to get moved. I went to management while working in a hostile work environment for 3 years SEVERAL TIMES. I was bullied, harrassed by the person I was supposed to be a team with. Everything she did was calculated. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I have a book documenting everything that person did. Eventually they terminated the store manager and within a month of the new one, I was moved. All the excuses the former gave me, he was a self absorbed liar....to keep me there and be tortured was horrible and I will never forget it. They second manager was great. Now, he was promoted (rightfully so) and we have another one. He's fairly new so I'm not sure what to expect. "
good,Your work experience is directly related to your direct manager. All in all I can't complain.Only reason I don't rate them hire is because I have had better jobs that paid more. But I can't complain.
good,Ok place to work. Like every where over worked under paid. Management is pretty bad. They pay sales associates more than management. No perks or bonuses.
good,very stressful trying to meet sales  goals because if you don’t meet Your goals your hours get cut. They make everybody stay at the end of the shift and clean up the whole store and you can’t leave Until the store is clean management approvaluntil everything looks good buy management approval
good,"My mgs was really awful.  Horrible temper.  Would go off and start screaming at a moment's notice.  However, the store myth and asst mgs were amazing.  There were other great mgrs there also.  "
good,"Productive and fun workplace. fast paced u do need to meet a sales goal monthly. Get store discount of 25% off, flexible work schedule. Fast pace environment"
good,"Dillard’s is like a family, every one is friendly and up lifting. Customer service is very important and appreciated. The pay in my position unfortunately is to low and the hours are not regular work hours."
good,"Good work environment, i missed the people."
good,Dillards helped me groom my customer service skills. Dillards provided a flexible schedule for me when my child was in need of extra time from me. The always had a positive atmosphere.
good,"i really had no problems working at Dillards other than the fact that they generally wont put you on full time unless your a manager,i used to unload semi trucks,process and deliver goods to various departments,maintain four restrooms,vaccum all store and maintain outside perimeter of store"
good,"Greeted guests, customer service, trained employees, scheduling, emails, inventory, shipment, worked with team to make sales goals, hired employees, provided in put."
good,"Retail is retail, it's exactly what you expect. The daily/monthly sales goals are extremely unrealistic, and it's nearly impossible to make your goals without stepping on your coworkers toes. It's great for a seasonal/temporary job, but if you're thinking long-term it's probably not the job for you."
good,Fast paced at times during peak hours. Slow during later hours in evening. It was enjoyable helping the customers with shopping. I didnt like the rotating shifts.
good,It requires customer service skill and helping people to fine a right item that they're looking for and also learning about fashion design industry...
good,Dillard's is a nice starting retail job. Management can be a pain and sometimes you'll feel like they own you. Not a lot of room for advancement. Commission based departments are the most annoying.
good,"Job was fun but the sales were not."
good,"Dillard's is a great place to work at because many of the employees are very friendly and act like family, helping each other out. Yet, it depends on which department you work in because some employees try to steal sales from one another and employees must maintain a ridiculous sales goal."
good,I loved working at Dillard's until my department manager changed. Afterwards my hours were cut and my schedule preferences were disregarded. Great environment however
good,Dillards can be a stressful and unrewarding place when you are not surrounded by coworkers that you get along with. Systems that are put in place make it very difficult to be productive as a department if you do not get along with your coworkers.
good,It is a good job for someone seeking to gain experience in sales. The job promotes advancement within the company and have equal opportunity to advance in the many positions they offer.  Just as long as you work hard and you are time efficient.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company as a handbag specialist. I liked to create displays and help the customers. I would say this is a good company to work for. I do not recall having the benefits with them so I cannot comment on that. Overall, I did like working for Dillard's."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Dillard's. I worked in all departments, allowing me to learn all aspects of the store. I was promoted into a visual position and learned a lot during my time there."
good,I am not reviewing previous employers.  My experiences are no guarantee for anyone else.I do not appreciate being forced to complete this in order to post my resume.
good,"Dillard's has the potential to be a great place to work. However, the lack of diversity in higher positions is really needed. More training for managers."
good,I liked workin for that company the only problem I had was I was a temp an I didn’t get all the privilege the regular staff got but I hung in there cause I needed a job an I would have still bein there but they closed down
good,"It was a nice place to work overall."
good,Depending on the department you are assigned and the traffic of your store it can be difficult to hit sales goals to qualify for raises. I transferred from a higher traffic store to a different department in a different city with lower traffic. It was impossible to meet my previous sales goals. If I had stayed and not met my goals I would have slowly been decreased in pay until being let go.
good,It was a work stress free  environment and flexible  hours. The associated where very nice and hopeful in training new associate. It's a very peaceful working place
good,If you are a single person and want no life then its for you. other than that management sucks and hours suck. I wont ever work from here again or buy from here again
good,"Self managed to work in women's department, built in clientele relationship along with company's special events."
good,"I worked at Dillard's for over 7 years and worked at 2 locations. Let me tell you they were both different in management style. The first location was great and always promoted within the company. It was hard to schedule days off and had to always plan in advance. If something serious tho, they would work with you. All the managers there were really great though. They always seemed to wanted the best for me which was really nice"
good,"Not enough pay for the amount of work expected to be done, Not enough hours to be able to afford to live. Unfriendly staff. Inconvent hours for those who have children"
good,"Pays well, can be repetitive and tedious though. Not very rewarding outside of the higher than usual starting pay. Not much room for advancement as managers have been there a long time."
good,"The company is not employee friendly, you stand all day and practically do a lot of things at the same time. They are target oriented and if you don't meet your target always after a few months they will reduce your pay and subsequently fire you."
good,"Great Mission Statement that is hard to maintain. Too much focus on the numbers underlies the stated desire to provide great customer service. Creates challenges between associates. Having been in Sales management here the company needs to let the managers do their jobs, not micromanage every detail.No life balance. Store managers have too much autonomy to do as they please. Corporate management is not really aware of or doesn't care about the individuals. Just the outcome."
good,"I worked in children's shoes and was in charge of counting the money for the register, making sure the shoes were correctly organized by size and style. Keeping the sales floor clean. Hardest part of the job was that the management didn't care. The best part of the job was that I worked alone most nights and was able to work efficiently"
good,"Standard retail duties. Schedules vary. Departmental and store-wide cross-training encouraged. Some in-store moves and promotions. All in all, enjoyable workplace."
good,"I was a sales associate in the kids shoes, helping people with their shoe needs, i was also a cashier and i had to organize all the new shoes that will come in."
good,I worked at Dillards in the cosmetic department after graduating from college.  I enjoyed helping clients with cosmetics but I needed more of a career than what they could offer to me.
good,I enjoyed making people smile after a make over. Sold skin care and cosmetics. The hours were the hardest back then for me late nights kids were very small.
good,"I loved doing my job for the customers. The Dillard's that I worked at was in my hometown and I knew a lot of the customers from church, school, and previous jobs. The customers trusted me to help them with their needs."
good,I worked many years at Dillard's. I enjoyed my particular job but the expectations and demands kept increasing. I worked 50 hours a week and always had to bring my management work home. While I was in store I was required to sell merchandise which had an extremely high goal to maintain my pay.
good,"I enjoyed working in the fast-paced environment and there was something different to do daily. The management was intelligent, but not focused and things often went scattered. I enjoyed most of my colleagues, but the nature of the business was new to me and I ended up being ill-prepared for the rivalry present on a daily basis. Overall, it was a good job"
good,"A typical day at dillard's helping is promoting sales along with helping customers"
good,"Everyone is nice and management team is awesome no one is running behind you every second to make sure you doing your job, very calm and sometimes stressful."
good,"I worked temporary.  It was slow and I like fast paced working. The pay was decent, people were friendly.  For me I need something a little more in depth."
good,"Easy, worked during college, have to be outgoing and friendly to be successful in customer service, they have some people that have been there a long time but they do have a bit of a turnaround"
good,Gained experience and knowledge from my first manager in my department.  I currently work in the Home Department which is a very productive department especially during the holidays.  I've learned to create visual displays to merchandise our products.
good,"I started in sales. When I worked very hard at printing markdowns, setting clearance racks etc. While other employees just stood behind the register and completed check outs, my pay was cut! So hard work doesn't pay off at Dillards!!"
good,Responsible for the management team and staff of a $15.3 million store and the daily operations of the store as well as the supervision of the Management team and 120+ associates
good,It was very nice place to work for what money that you got paid. It was very easy to do the job but if you were looking for a part-time job this is the place to go
good,"Download Now"
good,I enjoy working here the people are nice. The commission is weird I think the state sees me as a hourly employee who gets bonuses. I wish they were more straight forward about the commission. Some of the people I work with are negative.
good,Your pay is determined by how much and how hard you work. If you are a hard worker you will be able to earn more money than other people. If you are willing to work it is a good place to work but there is not much room for career advancement.
good,Needs to set more realistic goals for employees. The discount was great but I didn't like having to apply for credit card to receive discount.  Needs more advancement opportunity.
good,I was one of the managers of the men's department. It was high stress level and a very hard job. Keeping up with sales and employees and making sure your department was spotless all of the time. I worked with a bunch of women and they were very much against any other women succeeding.
good,"It was a great environment. Met great managers and co-workers. "
good,This was a part time job. I wouldn't go back because management does not care about your life. They're only concerned with making their quotas to get their bonuses
good,"a lot or work, policy need to be consistency for all that work there. had the ability to be creative with displays. Things changed frequently based on the dm."
good,"Overall I had a good experience with Dillards. I was able to meet and make lifelong friends in my coworkers and sometimes my customers. I learned how to interact and talk to a diverse population. Of people. The bad is that the sales goals are impossible to make every day, there are good days but people shop online more."
good,"High paced atmosphere whose primary focus is on sales, and customer service. The focus was to exceed your daily sales quota, which was set based on your hours of work, and tenure."
good,A typical day at the workplace would commonly consist of managing new shipment and afterwards assisting guests through knowledge or promotions and/or specials
good,"It was an okay place to work because the pay was decent, starting at $12 an hour, but it was really competitive. There was always drama between coworkers because they were always trying to steal each other's customers. It got out of hand, and management does not help or care for the other employees."
good,"I initially started as Dillards as seasonal help and ended up getting a full-time job in the service clerk and shipping and receiving department, i really found the job dull."
good,"This job is a little hard, you have a goal you have to reach everyday and the people I worked with would stay by the register and get alomost every customer, so it was hard for me to reach my goal."
good,"Mis managed, kinda behind on modern style. Decent income and for the most part a good place to work. Turn over was high, but the management did seem to try."
good,A fun place to work. Constantly dealing with customers and there questions. Being able to take initiative to deal with customers questions. Being possitve and friendly.
good,I worked as a fragrance sales associate and it was a great way to get my foot into the beauty industry. I learned a lot and attended many brand education classes as well as learned from the vendors there. The workplace culture was pretty nice too and everyone was generally welcoming. There were a few events during the year that would bring the entire store together which I think really helped to boost comradery and morale.
good,I worked part time as a sales associate. I organized clothes by sections. I interacted with customers and cleaned the store everyday. this was a good enviroment
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and getting to know my clients. Dillards/ Clinique provided the training needed to advance and perform the best at your job.
good,I felt that it was just a job. There was not a lot of motivation to excel. You were treated like you were guilty of doing something wrong just showing up everyday. Bags were checked and weird rules were followed but I liked my co-workers.
good,Dillards is very fast paced and what I like to call controlled chaos. It is a supportive environment with room to grow. Working at Dillards you learn how to handle a variety of people and situations. you learn patience as well as multitasking skills.
good,Pretty good place to work all around. Managers need to be more relaxed in that type of work environment. Conworkers are fun to be around and work with l.
good,This job isn't a very bad job. The management isn't to bad. The work isn't hard at all and it's really laid back. I think the worst part is having to meet quota and how cut throat some of the co workers can be.
good,"Great discount which was 25% off anything and everything. Including items already on sale. So to take advantage wait until the end of the month when items go on a double sale, once this starts use your additional 25% off!"
good,If you can survive Dillards you can survive any position 
good,"A typical work day was started in the warehouse unloading stock and putting it into the correct area for transfer to the floor workers. In the mornings we did housekeeping which included vacuuming, cleaning, etc."
good,The mall here is Florence is a very old mall and Dillard's is a great place to work as for as the salary you make to sell clothes but the sales per hour thing makes it uncomfortable and not so work friendly with associates because of the stress of taking a pay cut if you can't make your sales per hour .
good,"Working at Dillard's is for individuals that enjoy a competitive workplace, you must be team player and not mind sales goals. If sales goals are not met, you are history."
good,"Overall Dillards is a good company. Maybe a little to focused on daily quota goals to see the value of what others do outside of ringing the registers. Many coworkers weren't trained on how to merchandise and keep a dept looking up to standards, including managers. The customer service overall was better than the visual of the store."
good,The other sales associates were very friendly and fun however the management was horrible. They don't train you at all and expect you to know everything. The pay was very nice though.
good,"You get promoted based on your sales, which creates a hostile work environment at times. It's easy work and goals are usually obtainable. I couldn't see myself growing here."
good,"It was nice in the beginning! Slowly I started not to like it, mainly because of the department manager. She was the major reason my sph quota was low. She was constantly taking my sales/consumer and when I confronted her about it, she “apologized” while continuing to still do it."
good,"worked in men shoes based of commission but not enough customers to make your numbers and it gets slow and you will have nothing to do. it was an easy job but you have to be prepared for that,"
good,"If you enjoy meeting new people and dressing them to their best.... this is the job for you. Keep in mind, sincerity sells the clothes for you! Have fun with it."
good,Dillards will start you off with a moderate sales goal. They will let you hit it initially but then move you up until it is impossible to reach. Then they will start cutting your pay or fire you.
good,Dillards was a great place to work to gain sales and management experience and knowledge. Very challenging and room to advance to certain levels with the company.
good,Utilized excellent communication skills to encourage the sale of merchandise to customers.  Used the cash register to ring up sales.  Merchandise markdowns and recovery.  The work environment is competitive and based on the production of sales.
good,everyday you had a monetary goal to achieve based on what you got paid hourly- if you wouldnt make those goals when review time came it could hinder any raises. Not my type of work environment.
good,Dillards only cares about issuing out credit cards and nothing else. The Savannah location is very slow and everyone is on their toes about reaching their SPH. Watch out for sneaky people
good,"It was a temporary job while my husband was laid off from his work.  The job was ok, but I had to be on my feet the whole time.  I was there for a month and quit when my husband went back to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at this job and I wish I could go back, I started working at the women's fragrance counter and man I wish I could go back to that. When I got ""promoted"" to be the counter manager at Origins, that was what ended it all for me. There was never any business at the counter and I always had a very high quota to meet, instead I would look over at the fragrance counter and be green with envy and angry at myself for leaving that area. I didn't even get a raise for being promoted. Don't let them promote you without making them offer you a raise and do your research!!!!"
good,Dillard's was an experience all in itself. I learned a lot of responsibility and respect for other people. I learned that I loved to count money and work with the public.
good,The hardest part of the job was pushing credit on customers who could not afford.  The best part of the job was serving customers and putting a smile on their face.
good,Typical retail job duties.  Fun environment and I enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis.  Clients were great and I enjoyed the fashion.  Management was great and worked with schedules.
good,sold paints red ones bule ones black ones white ones ate food at work and got to talk liked a lot of my co-workers also a lot of people also.only made like maybe 10 an hour
good,"Greet customers and find out what they are looking for. "
good,"Great place if you are just starting off in retail. Slow during the week days, very busy on the weekends. You must be able to work weekends and holidays. If you don't work on New Years day you will be fired."
good,"If you are self-motivated and wish to produce sales that provide a commission for your efforts, don't work here...go to Nordstrom.  Lots of backstabbing and jealousy for anything innovative such as walking a client to other departments on the floor to complete an ensemble with her permission, of course."
good,You had to constantly be helping customers to meet your quota for the day.  Some days were really slow so you would have no customers only payments. Great when it was holiday season.
good,This is an excellent place to work for a student or maybe someone who is need of a second job. Must have great customer service skills and carry oneself as a professional.
good,"As in any retail job the atmosphere was way too competitive, and the pay was not enough for the hours and the stress of the job.  The competition was frightful and a definite cause of problems among the employees.  Management did not treat everyone equally."
good,"It's classic retail. Fast, creative and a bit frustrating. All in all a good retailer and company to be associated. Good people, not great pay. Creativity and hard work is rewarded. I enjoyed training associates in merchandising and seeing final results of the work."
good,"I was at Dillard's for a decent amount of time. Made great money, but it was so stressful. And the management was very judgmental at my location. Any other Dillard's I've shopped at had very nice people and the management was enthusiastic about you working for the company. I'd recommend it due to the pay, but I'd say become a regular before you work there, so that way you know what you're dealing with from both sides."
good,It was a fun place to work. Employees and managers interact often for the benefit of the company. Employees were dedicated and the store manager would push you to give our best.
good,"I prefer not to talk about my experience with Dillards. In general, it was an okay place to work for. Some workers were great and others were not so much."
good,good company in general hours aren't great a lot of sales pressure management was good their late absent policy was not great benefits were ok and you could have unlimitedearnings potential based on your selling skills
good,The management was good about promoting if you showed you were hungry.  It was nice that you got a discount on your purchases which made it easy to dress for work.
good,Dillard's pays very well compared to other retail establishments.  The merchandise discount is good and a few times a year they have additional discounts for employees.  They carry some nice brands and you can find whatever it is you are looking for most of the time.
good,Did not like the culture of Dillards nor did I like the was the sales were very similar to commission. Made sales people less honest when recommending a product because they were too worried about making their hourly sales quota
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of is working with the applicants and clients and servicing their needs. This position teaches humility, hard work and patience."
good,"Sales,  work hard to meet company goals and to keep job, responsible for opening a certain amount of credit cards per month, assisting customers with products and ringing them up, putting up stock"
good,"When the store is not as busy managers always give us a task to do either to take care of stock or engage in information involving the merchandise the store sales, in order to provide the best customer service to the clients."
good,It was a good place to work being in the mall. Good discount and management was nice. The location I worked was in an outlet mall and a lot of the merchandise was clearance.
good,You had to maintain a level of sales so everyone was trying to get customers on slow days. It was better to work in the departments with higher priced merchandise.
good,"One of the best paying retail jobs you will find in town. As long a you meet your sales goals you shouldn't have any problems. They cut hours if you are one of the ones that were last hired, even if you are making your sales goals."
good,"This was my first retail job, and it was a good experience. I was still in school, so my manager was great about working around my class schedule. Since I was part-time, it was very easy to get specific days off as long as I email her in advance. I worked in the shoe department, which is the only area that receives commission, so it can be hard to make your numbers since people get very competitive. Plus, weekdays can be very slow. Otherwise, everyone I worked with was nice, and some were very helpful when I first started. I do have to say that there was a lot of drama because of sales, and the workers gossip. Also, management was not the greatest because some workers get away with stealing other people's sales, come in late and leave early, and never clean up their mess when bringing out shoes for customers. Overall, I enjoyed my time there (mainly because of the friends I made) despite some of the things that frustrated me."
good,A typical work day was counting my register and making sure my work area was neat and clean. I would assist customers in the men's department with their clothing options. I would put up any displays that needed to be set. I would stock merchandise and mark down items. The workplace culture was competitive and fun at times. Management was not very helpful when it came to meeting sales quotas. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff that I worked with on the sales floor.
good,Great place to work. I worked there for 3 years while going to school and it gave me some good customer service experience. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for long or short term employment.
good,"Unorganized and stressful work place, the pay wasn't was they said it would be when in the interview and the manager didn't listen to complaints or suggestions from the workers."
good,Quite competitive.  Very Superficial  judgement of employees and customers.  Rules often not the same for all employees.  Was not a balanced and happy  place to work..
good,very busy environment  with revolving staff. management asks too much of employees beyond their scope of work and asked to work off the clock. low compensation of sales
good,Dillards is good for people without young children. Working for dillards was a blessing when I had no children...after have my daughter the  hours became hard because the hour didn't match with my daughters school times...so it makes it stressful
good,i worked on the dock at Dillards. Its fast paced when there is a truck. The day was split. The mornings was housekeeping and the late part of the day was divided.
good,It was okay.  Manager and co-workers were great.  Not enough flow of traffic for new clients in the salon.  I don’t think I was there long enough to contribute fully since I never got benefits.  All in all it was a good place to work.
good,Customer service helping customers put together complete outfits I also did Freight put together mannequins and I loved to accessorize and do displays
good,"I enjoyed working alongside some of the people but management wasn't great working around school schedule nor providing days off. Some of the managers were very helpful while others looked down upon you and your skill if you were not a ""favorite"". There was a lot of good people in that company but I feel as if a lot of them couldn't shine because of who was in command and the high demand for sales."
good,"I enjoyed my job for the most part.  Holiday weekends got rather busy, boss sometimes did something special for the workers to be thoughtful.  I appreciated that."
good,pays good but stressful to maintain selling quotas. Hard to get days off. Worked with school schedule for the most part. Was able to work there for two years but wouldn't recommend for some one going to school full time.
good,"Overall I would say this place was okay to work at. The company itself is very competitive. The sales were the hardest part, keeping up with the quota given."
good,"dillards should have its own reality show. there is plenty of petty, unnecessary drama. you have to work extremely hard to make it there. the pay is very nice and you do get oppertunities to get raises if you can sell well."
good,Managers were supportive and open to new ideas.  Result driven company with the CEO’s pay tied to the stock price.  Decisions were always based on financials and held little regard for company associates.  Crazy holiday hours.
good,"Dillard's is a decent place of work. It is very laid back. Most of the business picks up during the end of the week and mostly on the weekends. If you love the weekend, dont work here."
good,direct receiver job was good  hours were very flexible and easy to complete.  job was easy and all you had to do was sit at a computer and log in inventory
good,"good If you deal with customers on a daily basis, be sure to stay patient when they come to you stumped and frustrated, but also be sure to take the time to truly figure out what they want — they'd rather get competent service than be rushed out the door!"
good,"Clock in check in to lower prices, stock checks"
good,"This location of Dillard's is no longer open. Meeting new people every day was a wonderful part about working retail. The job did not pay on commission, but raises and keeping the job were based on sales."
good,"Dillard's hourly pay is higher than most retail companies and majority of the customers appreciate your customer service. However, the company treats it's employees unfairly. Employees are penalized for not making their credit card quota."
good,"Very competitive.  Company mandated store displays ""arranged"" by young people right out of college and having no experience with clothing whatsoever.  During a holiday or sale event having one employee work at the cash register and he or she would key in his or her number and receive credit for the sale. If management was aware, it was not corrected, thus causing hard feelings among associates."
good,"I did not like working there - cut throat corporate atmosphere, boring product...punch card type job. Management was uninterested in their own jobs, uncreative."
good,"The job I had was boring, but to others Dillard's might be a fun place to work. I love the discounts there store was nice, They pick a lot of good staff to work there stores"
good,Dillard's like most companies is what you make it. I enjoy being in a competitive environment in which your hard work was noticed. i also like working with meeting and working with some great people. As a operations manager one of my job duties are to ensure that the store is properly staffed to our planned hours. Also I really enjoyed that the owner of the company would visit the stores. In such a big company that is unheard of.
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues. "
good,Dillard's is a good place to work and learn. Especially they offer really good pay for their associates. Management is much more lenient with the full time employees not with the part timers.
good,"I was responsible for taking inventory, assessing and ordering merchandise for the department, department sales, employee reviews, and making sure my employees met their daily goals. I was responsible for organizing any department events that we had."
good,I worked on commission which can be very cut throat. However I really enjoyed working for the boss that I had in my department. The hardest part of the job was the sales. You must maintain a certain sales goal or you will be let go.
good,"A typical day at Dillards i would do the stock, fix my aisle in the back room, re fix the rack, serve customer on the sales floor. Co workers were great to work with, The management really sucked and I don think i would ever work at dillards ever again."
good,"Was a learning experience and I am glad I did it! They pay fairly well for the area. Store has a lot of things to look at and buy. There is lots of parking, fairly safe environment to work in!"
good,"Working for Dillard's was a learning experience. I actually liked going to work because of the other associates and the department I was placed in we helped each other out always, in anything. I always had awesome recommendations from my customers and they always came back. The only downfall about Dillard's was our quotas you had to meet them and if you didn't they didn't care you would get terminated. They don't care about anything or anyone as long as they are selling."
good,"Ok company to work for."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, but management seriously needs to communicate with each other as well as the staff. Usually, theres either not enough people working so you're not able to provide 5 star customer service."
good,"Technologically behind the times, which made daily tasks take longer than needed. Can only use employee discount on a pre-paid card, which took a couple of days to process."
good,At Dillard's you have sales goals you have to meet which makes things a little competitive more in some places than others. That being said it is a nice place to work you get a awesome discount and great benefits.
good,Employment is contingent upon maintaining an average sales quota based on your rate of pay and work area.  In a depressed economy this is next to impossible.  It effects even the longest tenured and best sales performers.  The quota system breeds animosity between sales associates and puts on a lot of pressure.  They try to keep morale up with contests and store events but it is still difficult.
good,"Monitor sales and activities  to  ensure that customer receives quality service ,also responding to customer inquiries and complaints. Giving  good service is important because  you want to make it as pleasant as possible and meeting there needs as quickly to achieve good service. There is a large amount of work place culture  at Dillard s  The hardest thing is out sourcing trying to bring new money into the store, which I was very successful in. Most enjoyable was meeting the needs of people who were looking for something they needed."
good,I think that it is inappropriate to speak about an employee in this manner. I am not going to comment in neither a positive or negative manner. That is all.
good,It was very competitive especially for people who been working with the business for years. Getting paid weekly was a real pro to the company. You have to work hard for promotions.
good,Do not have a review! Typical day at work came in made sure my are was clean and then preceded to wait on customers to come in. The hardest part of the job was not making commission. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"Basics of selling, merchandising and mark downs. Learned how to work with many different personalities. Learned a lot about merchandising. Also, learned about inventory."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's was enjoyable.  I enjoyed working with the people,seeing them leave satisfied with their purchases.  The hardest part was being on your feet and long hours."
good,"pt hours are good, mostly equal days and nights worked   received 1 weekend off a month. weeks started sunday thru saturday. After 30 days received discount which was great."
good,"There was a lot of opportunity for growth, Because the store has so many other departments, you were afforded the opportunity to learn about the other areas of interest."
good,"Employees are paid higher on average more than other retailers, but they must be prepared to meet an hourly sales quota.  Store management and sales management are great at this location.  Work/ life balance is harder as you progress to sales manager positions.  Relocation is imperative for moving up in the company."
good,"Ok place to work part time, not much room for advancement, and didn't like hours, or the fact that I had to work weekends. Good environment if you are needing a beginning job, but not great if you have a family."
good,An exciting day at Dillard's would be a busy day of assisting clients at a face pace with finding the right items for them. At Dillard's a typical day would be cleaning fixtures in between assisting clients with their needs.
good,You would have to maintain relationships with all customers who entered the store. We were also required to ensure that the store was visually appealing to all customers and that their shopping experience was worth while.
good,I enjoyed working at Dillards Pensacola Florida location.  I was there for 2 years before transferring.  I liked the people I worked with and my managers.
good,What Dillard's provided is a development of sales abilities and merchandising. It provides a challenge that empowers the individual. You learn more about the product and why the customers needs are.
good,Gained sales experience. A typical day at work was to assist customers and persuade them to make purchases.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"Management shows lack of urgency. They have poor communication and that can make for a stressful work place. The atmosphere is decent, and they have solid sales occasionally."
good,"Nice merchandise, however family owned company , not open to a lot of advancement. No bending, by the book , not open for discussion, makes your abilities sometimes stagnated."
good,I only worked at Dillards part time for a couple of months.  I was a sales associate in the ladies shoe department.  This was my first sales job after graduating college.  It gave me a feel for the sales environment.
good,"Management is very hands off, but they like to come in at the last minute and throw you under the bus when their superiors come. The vacation time accrual is pretty fair and you get a relatively generous employee discount. If youre naturally great at sales and ok with being pushy, this will be great for you."
good,Meet your quota or get a pay cut tryin. The sales world is hit or miss. You can be really passionate about what you do and that still wont be good enough. Sale sale sale!!!
good,"Dillard's is a decent company to work for. They have a very big  group mentality however. Meaning "" more with less"" which is not always a bad thing as is goes."
good,"Culture: ladies shoe department was vicious when I worked there."
good,They are not family or people oriented blah I don't want to fill this out this is for everyone to make their own experince out of their own career each place is di
good,All stores are different and they depend on the managers to make or break the work experience. Where I worked was positive and the people were great! Very close and family oriented.
good,Everyone was to provide a great overall experience to each customer. The customers are the priority because they make the business keep running. Each department had to be organized accordingly and there were markdowns done every so often. As well as to make our daily quotas.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can make a customer smile. I try to get everyone to smile and have a great day. I don't like to see anyone without a smile.
good,A typical day at work was to assist customers.  I learned nothing.  Management was ok.  Workplace culture was like a family.  The hardest part of the job was cold calling. The enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Dillard's! A typical day was consumed with lots of emails, training, inventory control, and sales. I learned so much about clothing, fabric, material, and dye. Management was difficult and did not have a lot of knowledge. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job was the continuous learning new things."
good,"Had fun working. The employees are awesome , but be on top of your game. They're funny , relaxed , they work with you and they want what's best for everyone ."
good,"We were required to handle mark downs, inventory, displays,and sales records.  I enjoyed talking to people who were interested in paying merchandise. Talking to adults was fun."
good,"I already did a reveiw for this job, this is starting to get real annoying, idk why this is a requirement anyways I'm looking for a new job  not an old job."
good,"I met lots of returning customers who I loved helping. It was also a challenge finding the right item for the customer. I would have loved to float to different areas, and learn those skills as well."
good,The job was great and the pay was very awesome. The only problem I have with this job is the hours. We are understaffed and forced to work more hours.
good,"Dillards is a great store to shop if you have the money .  Clothes are expensive, as are the shoes and accessories."
good,"Daily quotas where overwhelming, they paid well until you were unable to achieve their high sales quotas, then you were punished by getting your pay cut."
good,"Depending on the department you are assigned the job can be very dull and ,regardless of how kind the management team is, due to unachievable sales goals, even for part-time workers ."
good,"The culture of this company is great and everyone that I worked with was amazing. The only issue I had was that, It was difficult to maintain my sales. Especially on slow business day's."
good,"I worked for this company throughout college. For the money I made( through commission) it was not worth the stress. Management was put under a lot of stress to exceed sales from the year before, but there was no consideration for fall of traffic and economy being considered. Even if you were with the company for ten years and one year you couldn't make the sales, you were out on the streets. Every employee is a number and graded by the amount of money you brought to the company, didn't feel like a family."
good,"open/close store, operational duties, markdowns, freight, visual, customer service, coaching, training, deposits, register, payroll, supplies, daily duties."
good,"it was an ok place to work, the management i feel was not as good as it could have been. i really liked mostly helping an interacting with the guests."
good,"Pleasant work environment with very competitive edge."
good,"Worked seasonally for the Dillards distribution center in Maumelle.   Steady hours, good pay. Management was good.  They use mostly temps during the holiday time."
good,It's a pretty boring job management is nice  enought but what you really need to watch out for is the older employees a lot of them are older so they thing they know best when they can bearly even work a computer. Job is super easy but the store managers come and go and the most recent store manage is just trying to clean house she is super rude. She needs to realize that while they are your employees it doesn't mean you can talk down to them then get mad when they speak up for them self after you tried to break them down.
good,I've learned a lot about bra sizing.The hardest part is maintaining your credit app ratio. Overall it's a nice place to work.
good,This was my first retail job. It was fun to work at. I started around the holidays and it was fast and easy. Once the holidays ended though it was a slow boring environment.
good,A very nice work atmosphere decent hours and work conditions. Very hard to get promoted due to structure of promotional opportunities. There is also a ton of turnover due to sales quotas
good,"Overall great experience,enjoy developing associatesto be better and successful at their jobs not only servising customers, but incrising pay of rate and earning their respect by holding them accountable when needed but most of all listening and hear their feedback makes you feel accomplish and great about been their manager.However  power of authority, hours and workload"
good,"Love the pay. It's a job where you can't be afraid to engage customers. Some of the management is great, but that's any workplace."
good,Management changes their mind on how things should be often. They definitely play favorites. They will tell you one thing and then do another or say they don't remember discussing it. The SM and ASM are on a big power trip and treat the majority of employees terrible unless they like you. They gossip about their associates all the time. The don't give you paid breaks they just include that time with your lunch which is unpaid.
good,they view you as a number they dont care how long youve been working threre. I had co workers that worked for over 10 years and because their sales werent as high as they were supposed to be for a couple of months they were fired.
good,"Dillard's was a nice place to work, they take good care of their employees. The job was very stressful at times and their was a lot of drama in the workplace which I did not like. The higher management could've been better as well, they were rude and didn't work very hard most the time. The hardest part of the job was probably meeting my (ridiculously high)  sales quota daily, especially on slow days."
good,I worked in one of the clearance stores and overall it just seemed disorganized. The hours were great and the job was easy.
good,"Quotas to meet"
good,"I worked with couples to plan their gift registry. Our first meeting could easily last 2 hours. I helped them select items they liked for their guests to purchase for bridal showers and wedding gifts."
good,"overall the company is ok to work for its all about how you balance your schedule and work. the pay is ok and so are the associates,"
good,I enjoyed working here. My manager was very helpful and encouraging. I only didnt agree that the top corporate people gave you three months to hit a crazy high quota then fired you if you didnt make quota. Afterwards hire people that have less experience instead of investing in the good employees they had.
good,I loved the people at my job and the customers. A typical day at work was getting customers to fill out credit card applications and meeting my sales goal. The sales goal was the stressful part. But other then that it was nice.
good,"Open and Closing of store, payroll, sales, Coaching sales team, weekly meetings, store operations, store core, inventory control etc."
good,Dillard's is an okay place to work. The starting salary is lovely; however the flaws in the work environment and management quickly become apparent.
good,Great start out with part time work that quickly turned into full time. Many travel opportunities and fun experiences at conventions. Great opportunities networking while expanding the company sales.
good,I personally was burned out with customer  service in retail. The pay is awful unless you just want a job. Have to be a people person and enjoy folding constantly.
good,"I enjoyed working retail for the current up to date fashion.  I also meat one of my best friends working at Dillard's. You are constantly picking up clothes after people so that kind of got tiring from time to time, but all in all it was fun"
good,"Nice atmosphere, every day is a new experience, meeting all sort of people."
good,"Management bad at one time but I hear it's better now. Dillard's is a very old fashioned place to work. You must manually sticker all merchandise during a sale. Very out of date at times, Overall, not a bad environment to work in, just depending on people. They can behave as sharks due to the sales goals; every man for himself."
good,It's a very high pace environment. Constantly staying busy. I learned a lot with being an assistant manager. The hardest part of the job is resolving customer conflicts with a high level of customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people.
good,"Typical day at work - helping customers have one on one shopping experience and giving 5 star service.  "
good,Loved the work; but closing at 10pm became a problem since I had a 30+ mile commute with 2 kids left home alone. Not safe to travel alone at night and no work/life balance
good,"The typical day was opening up and then waiting "
good,"Excellent merchandise and excellent customer base which made the position very enjoyable. Sales associates were required to meet sales per hour quotas and if you did not meet those requirements at your annual review, a ""pay cut"" was given and if you went over, of course, a raise was earned. This was the most stressful part of the job because everyone in the department was in competition for sales and at times created problems between some associates and selling business managers. I learned very early in my career at Dillards' to always be alert to customers and no matter what else I had to do such as merchandising, moving fixtures, etc., the customer had top priority and also I learned to do bra fittings and do them very well because, as I learned quickly, they were my ""bread and butter"" so to speak. In my years there, I did earn raises and commissions on top of that and did not experience a ""pay cut"". The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public and helping them as much as possible."
good,"I enjoyed my days with Dillard's as a fragrance specialist my manager was great and understanding of my time and needs. Daily tasks included a cash drawer, stocking, cleaning and most important my sales goals."
good,"Working at Dillards taught had work, dedication and a large growth in social skills. Through this opportunity I was able to learn valuable skills working in the real word such as working as a team with co-workers and approaching tasks in the most efficient manner possible."
good,"Good work environment,  friendly management decent hours. Decent pay. Good flexibility in scheduling, I would definitely consider working there again."
good,"I enjoy working at Dillard's  however, dealing with an SPH system is very stressful. My co-workers are great to work with. I enjoy seeing the new styles that come in."
good,"Helping customers find the products that meet their needs. Suggesting products, explaining how products work, demonstrating how to use products, performing makeovers, and operating the cash register. Meeting sales goals, building customer relations through follow-up calls and mailings, recruiting new customers, managing inventory. Stocking shelves, and organizing sales areas. Providing exceptional customer experiences by ensuring the customer is always the priority. Maintaining high customer readiness standards by ensuring proper presentation as well as good house keeping"
good,Management well organized and staff work on team levels.  Priority is making sure all customers are taken care of in all capacities.
good,"This was a very stressful job. A typical day included the following:"
good,Has great benefits and opportunity to grow with company. You must have a strong selling skill set in order to receive raises and keep your job position.
good,"Great pay during the holiday seasons."
good,"A typical day at work was ok.  I learned a whole lot about multi-tasking, and running a department.  My co-workers were fabulous!!  I miss them more than words can describe.  Some of management(not all) needs work on how they treat people.  I gained a lot of valuable experience that I hope to utilize again very soon.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and customers I met."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard in Customer service and in the accounting department or the cash room, but when I came to the sales floor that is when I wasn't satisfied .  I had to do a lot of standing, and that work on your back."
good,"This job was fun because I got to sell women's shoes which is something that I love, and interacting with the customers was also fun."
good,A day at Dillard's consisted of meeting and greeting customers and helping them with any of their specific needs or wants. Working with and against people who are different but share some of the same interests as you. Management worked with us and helped us understand the best ways to help our customers in a way that met each customers satisfaction. Hardest part was keeping calm and collected when a customer became unnecessarily rude. The most enjoyable would be working alongside woman who understood you and were there when you needed advice or a laugh.
good,A typical day was made up of getting stock to the sales floor . Helped customers with their shopping needs . I worked with a good team of people . Doing what you enjoy is never hard . The enjoyable part is service to customers who want to look good .
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting friendly nice customers that shop there and building that relationship with them.  Easy going workplace. The hardest the job is that it is very competitive.
good,"Part-time job. Would like a full-time with a career potential."
good,"Dillards is a good place to work they pay decent and have commsion opportunies available allowing you to make even more money, The eployees are a mix. Managment was a little snobby and do not act like they care about the employee. DIllards is pretty fleixible on the schedules and giving time off though."
good,Scheduling is a major conflict here. I worked in women's shoes which had a great team but an awful assistant manager who had a reputation as a liar. She'd always make sure to tell the employees that they needed to work together and come to a compromise which essentially was meant to soften up the employees so she didn't have to deal with them and did not compromise.
good,"Personally I found the inconsistencies in they company to be quite annoying and I found the way in which we were required to approach customers and berate them about credit applications to be quite overwhelming. I personally loved my department manager in Ladies shoes, as I wired there for a little over 5.5 years. As far as I was concerned I worked for her and not Dillard's. I was lucky enough to only ever have one store manager I didn't care for otherwise I found everyone to be very pleasant to work with."
good,"Get the registers ready, showcases and show tables ordered, Tend to customers needs of purchase provide with the product information and if precise size needed."
good,"Dillard's is a great opportunity to work you way up in retail. They pay you well but you have to be committed to your job. Early, mornings and late nights with frequent changes. If you like excitement, Dillards is the place for you."
good,Working here was extremely stressful as a college student as they were not very flexible with hours. Making sales goals was really hard during slow season and stressful.
good,"I learned to stay positive and motivate my team member to makes sales goals"
good,I enjoyed my position very much there.  My manager was a bit insubordinate in my opinion.  The store manager is amazing though.  I learned a great deal in the Cash Office.
good,"They are good about paying for relocation.  Expectations are high and it is unspoken that work comes before family.  They compensate well at first, but if they can get away with not advancing your salary adequately they will do so."
good,A good place to work with fair pay and good people.  Benefits are not  good.  Command and control style management.  Still a good place to work.
good,i was a ladies shoes department employee. Working here was OK. You have to make an hourly quota which was almost IMPOSSIBLE to make DAILY. Senior Co-workers were very competitive when it came to making a sale. Management was poor and basically left you alone till others taught you how or you learned yourself.
good,Can be fast paced at times but then you have the down time where you are not doing ANYTHING.  Have to clean up after everyone.  Changing rooms are the worse.
good,I enjoyed my time at Dillards. I worked with very nice associates.  I also enjoyed helping customers choose merchandise that they were happy with.
good,"On a semi-busy day, we would open the registers, clean the counters and bays, unload new product, set up new signs, design cases, and aid customers. I learned how to deal with people, how to gift wrap, how to make gift baskets, how to plan events and gifts, and how to be successful in a retail atmosphere. Management left some to be desired. I liked working with several of my co-workers and became good friends with a couple. The hardest part was having to do things that you didn't agree with that was not in the best interest of the customers. The best part was making customers happy."
good,"Dillard's is great at promoting within. One can start out as a sales associate and move up to store manager easily with commitment and hard work. Even I moved up quickly from a sales associate to business manager within a short time. However, the atmosphere of management is not a fair environment. There will be favoritism towards some managers, who will get special treatment and training to grow and learn, while other managers will be ostracized and left to learn as they go. Equal treatment is very important for a healthy work place environment."
good,stressful sales goals and events expectations. dillard's doesn't advertise so it is up to employees to get traffic in sotre
good,"The point of working at Dillard's is to give 5-star customer service at all times. You will need to be personally helping at least 3 people at all times if you want to make your daily sales goal. This job will teach you how to multi-task and how to connect with a customer in a personal way, instead of just interacting at the register only. Your co-workers will make or break you. If you work with a group of girls that are willing to help each other out, then it will be enjoyable for you. However if your co-workers are ""sale sharks"", then watch out. Management will not listen to your complaints, it's something you will have to fix on your own. Honestly, I loved my co-workers. We all understood how to work hard and help the customer, but to back off if the customer belonged to someone else. It was a great environment."
good,"Sales Home goods, "
good,"There are lots of different departments you can work in. Some better than others, depending on your resilience to sometimes terrible coworkers and possibly worse management. Most people who have worked there more than a decade  (more than you think) are very aggressive about their sales, and its the companies fault for making it so competitive. Someone who pbly is usually a very nice person is snarling and foaming at the mouth because you unknowingly took a sale from them.. *sigh*"
good,"In the year of 2012 I was employed at Dillard's in Manhattan, KS. The pay is okay, but scheduling for a college student can be a pay."
good,i opened a store from the very beginning with four hundred employees   I did the mass hiring for the department store and stayed five years to followup and follow through.
good,Dillard's is an amazing company to work for. You're treated as if you're a manager even when you're at the bottom of the chain.
good,"For a college student this position would be okay, the hours vary and are never the same it is nearly impossible to get what you request and to get a consistent schedule. They pay is good starting at 12 an hr but can go down if performance is poor."
good,Managed entire store. I increased sales and profits. I took much pride when I developed successful associates and managers.
good,Clickish management. Kiss their butt or be talked about. compensation is great. If business is slow and so are sales they will cut your pay by like two dollars. Not fair!! Cant help it if no customers! They start you off with great pay but cut it tremendously if you don't meet their unachievable sales goals. Cut throat competition between co workers.
good,"Helping guest find and suggest merchandise to meet their needs.Organizing,straighting departments,putting out new stock and cashiering. I have learned about the different fabrics in dresses,alterations and visual merchandising."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, i just wished they payed more. They too have a nice client base. People are not shopping at Dillards like they used to unless they have huge sale and then they really need more associates on deck."
good,"Usually you come in to your designated area at the beginning of every shift, make sure everything is straightened out and put out any stock that might have come in that dayl"
good,"i enjoyed my job, but i feel they wanted me to have too many duties and responibilites for my pay rate and not being able to hire me full time. Which made them only stretch my hours so thin so i could be able to work everyday."
good,"My co-workers are wonderful people although they can be overly competitive at times. The hours are great and the variety of stores is extensive. However, the parking is not so good. It is usually hard to get close to a door."
good,"When their was a price difference in an item, we would research it, put the proper price on it so it could be sent to the stores."
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work.  However, it was not a great fit for me as it is not within my career field and there was no benefits."
good,I enjoy my time at dillars the only thing I did not like was some of the customers was rude and  did not like no one to touch their things or help them.
good,"Managed three departments within one store. Upper mgmt in company struggles with handing down decisive directives, and changes their game plan almost daily. "
good,"Coworkers all got along and worked together to keep the store running smoothly, management was not always the best, but also did their best to keep their respective departments clean and to directive."
good,"I get along with fellow co-workers.  I have learned a lot about selling sunglasses and watches to customers with aids  from management  and vendors.  Overall, I enjoy servicing and helping customers."
good,Some positions in this company are good. Decent health benefits. Depending on department can have great team work. Sometimes horrible schedules and hours.
good,I worked full time for Dillard's for 5 years. It gave me the chance to broaden my skills and earn a good living. I thought that I would be able to retire there but I was very wrong. The daily sales quotas that they set up aren't based on actual sales numbers or present year numbers but based on what corporate thinks they should be according to the previous years. Department store sales are declining year after year and you can see that stores are shutting down all around you. So don't plan to stay there for long.
good,"Management had favorites and would make you ring your commission sales under people who were missing by thousands to bring them back up, which then put you in the hole."
good,"a typical day at dillards open register , count draw and get ready to sale sale sale.I think the company should care more about employees and give more hours instead of hiring more people to the company"
good,Always staying up to date on the new fashion and handbags that were out.  Helping others and assisting others with picking out the perfect gift for others.
good,"Flexible hours, minimum pay. Great job to have while in school. Supervisor was very flexible. Great co-workers and customers. Nothing long term beneficial unless a person wants to work in retail at a minimum salary until infinity. Good part-time supplemental work."
good,"This job was based on commission, causing the employees to become competitive and hostile towards each other at some points. Working closely with the customers was enjoyable, but the stress management puts on you every day to sell anything and everything becomes a bit heavy."
good,"Can be stressful at times, but it isn't a bad place to work. If the store is small, it can be difficult especially if you aren't good at selling things."
good,"loved working with the customers,to help them with their wants and needs. helping them to find and get what they were looking for,customer satisfaction."
good,"Fun for the most part, good environment except the store manager. Fast pace, fun helping difficult customers and getting to do your best while making sure to keep the fitting rooms and racks cleaned and organized."
good,"I am able to be a top fitter and sales associate because of the products Dillard's has. (I have been sewing since I was a young child and this job has targeted one of my many talents.)"
good,A fast paced work environment. The hours can be long but overall a good place to work. Have met really good people through my employment.
good,"When i first arrived at Dillards it was pretty great, good pay, awesome coworkers, and flexible hours. Over the past 2 years my department has had 2 different managers and it has never made it back to its former glory. More associates than needed are hired on, makes meeting a sales quota difficult."
good,It was a very stressfull job no life out side of that company the sales goal is not good they will fire you because of it make paople fight over sales.
good,Learned great communication skills and meeting personal sales goals throughout the week. The most difficult part of the job was meeting your goals which were sometimes set too high.
good,Working there we had slow days.  It wasn't that hard to keep busy.  I had to straighten clothes racks.  I always was in my area keeping it clean.
good,"A typical day working at Dillard's would be unloading stock if there is any, cleaning the work area, and the most important, which is helping customers. I learned how to size watches and what it's like to have a sales quota. The hardest part of the job was having customers come in and try to return merchandise because Dillard's has a strict return policy of 30 days, so sometimes people would get upset and I'd have to tell them the policy politely, but sometimes I'd have to call a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find jewelry for special occasions."
good,"I learned quite a bit as a selling business manager at Dillard's.  I would work on schedules, merchandise, answer telephone calls, assist other managers on projects, etc."
good,The company that really doesn't appreciate your work. Very often it is hard for managers to thank their employees. For the most part managers will be hired from aside rather than promoted within the store.
good,Being employed at Dillard's warehouse means you are a very hard worker and you are dedicated to your work as well. I worked very long hours and honestly I loved it.
good,"It was an hot environment. This jobs was very easy just scanning products and putting them in boxes. The manager that was over us was fun, nice and outgoing. She made the workplace a great place."
good,Was a really good job to have during college. I learned a lot about sales and always reached my quota plus some. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction.
good,Working at Dillards was a challenge you almost always had someone how was not satified for some reason. My co-workers were easy to work with.  A typical day for me was when the head people were pleased with the sales made at the end of a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I got to shop sales.
good,"good environment, sales associate, i been there for almost a year, and i work part time, worked with nice co workers. good management."
good,"Dillard's pays extremely well for the economy, typically starting associates at more than $11 an hour. The best part of the job is seeing the same customers come in on a regular basis and creating a relationship with them. It is unfortunate, though, that employees work on a quota system. Sometimes one gets lucky and a customer buys everything they are shown. Other times the customers buy very little after spending much time debating, trying, looking. While some area managers do make an effort to show appreciation, upper management struggles with this and makes the work environment somewhat unpleasant."
good,"Great place for a seasonal job. Pay is very good even when only working 25 hour weeks. It is very hard, and almost impossible to become full time though, atleast at the store where I worked. It's a good place to get a job when you have to have one until you can find something better."
good,"Great co-workers and seeing new products first is the best. Also employee discount on merchandise is awesome. "
good,"A typical day included opening registers, assisting customers that came in. Put stock out on floor, organized and maintained stock as well. Completed sales transactions, assisted with promotional events. As well as closed by counting registers, and putting up stock and securing customers exited building safely. Also help set outfits on mannequins and set floor displays."
good,"Good pay, ok environment. Fun boss and you can definitely pay bills with this job. This job and its pay isn't a joke. I would recommend it."
good,It great place to work if you like retail. You must be sale orient and love meeting customers. You must also be  a fashion dress person.
good,You are able to move up and around the store as much as possible . They do offer good pay raises as much as possible. Depending on the store location you can receive commission
good,Very good customer service position. I loved working with customers and assisting with their needs. It help me to want to go to work and feel good about my job.
good,"While working, I developed more retail skills,the most enjoyable part was making a customer feel good about themselves and their purchase."
good,Good working environment. Very nice people. Poorly managed. Currently having a problem employing full time positions. But overall a decent place to make a temporary living.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Dillard's when I was first hired on in September, however around two months ago the Store Managers that hired myself were transferred and we got two new managers to fill their roles. As is with anyone new all the associates tried to welcome the new management with open arms and smiles, however it was quite apparent that the kindness was not reciprocated. Within two weeks of being their the new managers had let go of four people with a combined work experience of almost 10 years. After that everything just continued to go downhill with every employee feeling less and less secure about their jobs. Unfortunately I made the decision to leave Dillard's as they had simply become a different company than the one I had been hired on at."
good,"Everyday we would begin by cleaning the store. Later we would continue by processing and unloading the truck; I would deliver products to different departments in the store. If management needed anything from us throughout the day I would address their needs then go back to processing.The dock team worked like a team or teams throughout the day. there could have been better communication, but no system is perfect. The most enjoyable part of working at dillards were the customers and helping them; a lot of the older generation have fun stories and jokes to share with us the younger generation. Hardest part of the job (dillards is slightly unorganized) finding things such as the right sized bolt or ratchet sizes, also finding the correct fixtures for the floor. Management changed so much but the managers that stayed longest were fair managers. Three stood out and I will always appreciate them."
good,Clocked in . Set up more than one register. Went over sales slips . Cleaned around cases and mirrors. Set up displays and floor models. Assisted customers and offered promotional deals and credit card applications.
good,A typical day is easygoing but somewhat stressful. I've learned the importance of great customer service. Management could be better. My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job would be working with limited space in the stock room. The most enjoyable part would be working at a comfortable pace.
good,Helping customer feel good about themselves and find things that make them happy and comfortable. Pretty cool job to have.
good,"I really enjoy working at Dillards. However, it's a very competitive environment with outrageous quotas. You are on your feet constantly fighting for any kind of sale. I enjoy the competition and the self-determination that the job provides but it kind of sets you up for failure with the impossible daily goals."
good,"good people work there management not so much, hours not so bad on most days training not so much for most jobs some days better than others"
good,"Assisting customers, attending to the customers needs, creating ideas to  gain more revenue, having a supporting management team and insuring that the customer spend money and that the customer leave satisfied."
good,"I had an amazingly supportive store manager, worked in the largest of 4 stores, building an intense clientele base. With the assistance of one of our top vendors, I was capable of receiving the best piece goods in order to support the Las Vegas client who came from abroad regularly because of our networking."
good,I enjoy working with the customers helping them to choose something for a special event or to update their wardrobe. I've grown to appreciate all the hard work that goes in to working retail.
good,"I promote and display merchandise for customer appeal creating smooth transactions and retail displays.  I also demonstrate sales technique and a working knowledge of fine jewelry, watches, gold, silver, diamonds, and gemstones."
good,"Long hours, stressful hours!!!  It was physically demanding to be on your feet.  They would ask you ro do multiple tasks while also helping customers."
good,"A typical day on the job at Dillard's was for the most part enjoyable, i enjoyed the people i worked with in my section of the store and i loved the customers i got to work with form day to day. The thing i did not like about working for Dillard's is the high sales quota that i found to be near impossible to achieve."
good,"I had great interactions with the customers and clientele that i accrued while working at Dillard's, but the work environment was very hostile."
good,The average work day is pretty consistent. There are not many changes in the daily tasks.
good,I assisted customers and helped with purchases and I cleaned.
good,"Associate in the big and tall section of the men’s department"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of merchandising, sales, customer service, and maintaining a positive attitude. I've learned an ample amount about customer service and how to generate sales. I enjoyed working with the team that I had. The most important part of the job was the customer service along with making sales. I believe the hardest part of the job was not being able to help a customer with exactly what they need. On the flip side of that, the easiest part was when I would get a customer that was so pleased with the help that I provided them and they would come back specifically so I could help them again."
good,The thing that I did not like about this company was the policy that they have to attract the costumer! I don't like  to steel costumer from my co-worker !  Because I am a costumer as well I know that is not a good feeling when two people come together and try to drag you to his or her side !
good,"Great company when It comes to pay , management is not always on the same page  do your job and you'll be fine, don't get caught in gossip , work hard , you'll succeed."
good,Managing the Home Department takes a lot of effort. I know that standing on my feet all day is not enough to complete this job. It takes great effort and strengths yet a good quality of on going effort as well on my part.
good,daily ran reports on day to day operations managed multiple areas
good,the pay is great for a department store but the work does take up all the time in world
good,very flexible and professional enviroment to work in. Supervisors were helpful and friendly
good,It's a hard place to move up unless you're part of the inner circle. Quick to hire outside of the company instead of promoting within.
good,"typical day at work i usually clean up and help customers "
good,Working at Dillard's had its up and down sometimes when it come to dressing mannequins and putting up clothes. But I did like having my own section to look after.  Helping customer get want they want really make me happy and the customer were happy to. I love when we had to make sure that all the items had there sales price on them so the customers can enjoy the sales prices too.
good,My day  consisted of showing customers top quality merchandise.
good,"Big box retail store. Weekly paycheck with decent benefits. Great place to work part-time, or if you're a retail person. Must have a college degree and be willing to move to get promoted. Sales Associates get worked very hard doing multiple jobs. Must deal with lazy, paycheck collectors, posing as sales professionals."
good,"Love the people, friendly co-workers, help you when needed"
good,Communication is key for this position.  Enjoyed the overall customer service aspect of position.
good,"This was a great experience for me. I started as a business manager"
good,"Customer Service, helping customers, adding clients"
good,You must do good in order to stay with this company. Quotas are a major deal.
good,"A typical day included putting out stock waiting on customers, contacting them about promotions and other clerical duties."
good,"It's a fun and energetic place to work to meet new people."
good,"It was a good experience"
good,"selling products to customers, friendly customers"
good,"The people that work with you are cool.  A typical day consists of merchandising, customer service, as well as an emphasis to meet daily/monthly goals."
good,"Great time working with Lancome via Dillards. I Love skincare and cosmetics. I Love teaching beauty, and coaching and developing Beauty Advisors."

good,"A typical day would included coaching associates on sales and service techniques. Going over numbers and analysis your business. Answering pages for different department and associates. One to two meeting."
good,"I learned so much at my time at Dillard's. Patience, positivity, and a fierce work ethic have been the keys to my success. I enjoy the customer service aspect as well as coaching my associates."
good,"During my time with Dillard's, I have learned so much and excelled in all of the positions that I have held. As the manager of a $4 million annual sales department, I am responsible for merchandising, setting and achieving daily goals, coaching my team, and all other aspects of managing. I am extremely personable and take pride in my ability to make others feel comfortable and excited to work towards the goals that I help them set for themselves."
good,"	Greet and build quick rapport with customers in selected department."
good,"Running product to various locations of the store. Learned that even though a job may be easier than the Navy, the demands to perform well apply at any position. Co workers stuck to themselves. Not having a name tag was not the hardest part of the job, but when trying to help customers in a department store without a name badge, they assume you are trying to do more than help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours that I worked. They were set and never changed."
good,honestly I never really got into this job and the reason being it was my first and I was confused and not really sure of what was going on in this job.
good,"Sales in hand bags, hosiery and jewelry. Enjoyed the people."
good,sales quotas impossible to meet.  management seems to only care about making quotas.
good,I had to supervise various employees keep up with the billing process for charge accounts within the store. I issued instructions and assigned duties to my employees
good,"Working at Dillard's was feast or famine.  I worked in all areas of ladies clothing and got to know the regular customers and their likes and dislikes. Because of forming relationships with customers,  I was able to track their purchase history and contact them when new arrivals came in; this would assist with achieving sales quotas.  I enjoyed most of my coworkers and established great respect for them with sales strategies and creative ideas with displaying merchandise.  The hardest part of working at Dillard's was working most weekends and the long hours on my feet.  I enjoyed the sales during the holiday season and creating eye-catching displays."
good,"Fast paced working environment, worked directly with customers taking care of their need at hand. The management was good, very friendly and also understanding. Overall this was good work experience from this company."
good,"Expected to maintain sales quota or your hourly pay would be decreased"
good,"My typical day at work was 15 to 20 hours."
good,When you sell certain items for the month you are eligible for prizes. It is nice to be rewarded for helping customers.
good,"ringing up merchandises, doing markdowns and inventory. sometimes other sales associate are too greedy."
good,"A typical day at work is providing customer service and providing training to associates on the sales floor.  The hardest part of the job is that once you make a certain number, you are always expected to beat it next time and once one event finishes, there is another one around the corner. Most enjoyable part of the job is the connection with clients and associates."
good,Dillard's was a fine place to work except that my coworkers were shop lifting and nothing was being done about it. Management and employees achieved sales goals.
good,I enjoyed helping customers and the store discount was amazing but it was a little slower paced than I like. It was also great getting the early heads up on future sales.
good,"My training days were scattered and unorganized, I'd show up to work for the first 2 weeks, not knowing what I was doing or where I was going, when I looked for help in management they were as lost as I was. Whenever I had problems with things they, left out in ""training"" the managers were never easy to find. Although this poor managed business was hard for me to get the appropriate help I needed, It taught me problem solving and customer service the hard way."
good,Constant perfection within department store products and pricing.
good,"My day at Dillard's typically involves at least one meeting with my store manager to discuss upcoming events and expectations. Beyond that, specific planning does not truly exist. As management in retail, the most important part of my day is handling customer issues, which can happen at any time. This has truly taught me time management skills that no other profession could. I rely on my team in my departments to merchandise and sell to meet our store-wide goals, and must train and coach new associates to become part of the team, which is my favorite part of my job. However, with an often-changed schedule due to last-minute corporate visits, the position becomes draining. Planning a life outside of work is difficult, and with the amount of physical work required (constantly on your feet, merchandising, setting up visual), eating and sleeping are often the only things I ever want to do after work."
good,"Dillards had several issues, such as they only hired management from outside and never offering raises no matter how good a job you did but other wise it was not a bad job and i enjoyed all the busy work"
good,"Long shift, but decent pay. Overall a good place to work. Management works well with scheduling and overall respect for an employee is great for a retail employer."
good,"In the beginning it was all fun, but after being there for 2 years, some of the fun is gone. No sales,no customers, no raise. New people are getting hired for way more per hour when some of the people in the past got hired for way less."
good,"30 hours per week working in the men's shoe department. Bending, stooping, putting shoes on customers and restocking shipments to the stock room."
good,"-processing markdowns"
good,"A typical day at work includes checking the computer to see what the department daily goal is and discussing this with my employees in a morning meeting. Also, I look at what I need to sell personally too and what areas in the department are trending. Every morning I check to see if we have markdowns and finish them promptly. As soon as customers step foot into the area I converse with them and ask what they are shopping for and from there on I take on a role of a personal stylist for them, picking out clothes and showing them to a dressing room. When they finished trying on I clean up after them and ring them up. The same goes with my associates and their clients. My most enjoyable part of my job is that it is a constant fast-paced environment and I am never bored."
good,"Worked in shoes, very competitive environment. I had to fight for sales. I was supposed to get a discount card, never received it."
good,It was pretty awesome. got paid weekly. and the consistant schedule was cool.
good,"You have to make a quota everyday, even if its not busy or there are not enough customers. Can be fun and good job for someone that is competitive and doesn't mind upsetting the older workers there. I learned how to work with a much larger amount of people and personalities that might clash. Management is great, they understand when you have problems and work with you. Co-workers are nice as long as you don't step on anyone's toes. Most enjoyable is helping people and having a relationship with a lot of different people you wouldn't normally associate with."
good,was a temporary job but i did enjoy it there and would love something in the same area while in school
good,"Typical day entailed helping customers find items they were seeking, and using suggestive selling to complete wardrobe."
good,"Not a personable place to work or shop because the staff isn't serious about their job. Unless it's the makeup counters, those women are exceptional."
good,"The in house mngt doesn't care about your preferences in which area you would like to work in. The store mngr seems to feel they know what's best for you. Also, the main job requirement is your sales per hour. With so much work to do, it's quite difficult to sometimes focus on customers who might be looking around the dept. I like job most of the time, but due to poor management I prefer to work somewhere where I'm more appreciated."
good,"During the busy seasons work and the hours are wonderful.  During the dead seasons where business is slow, unless working fulltime hours, part-time is hard to get hours, which makes it hard to pay bills."
good,Working here was pretty cool.  but.... I was in the fragrance and cosmetics department.... but I was the only MUA in the area.  So if someone needed assistance in other makeup lines they would come to me.....
good,"Opened or closed and called in cash register amounts. Dressed mannequins with newly arrived styles. Learned how to measure and fit customers for alterations. The most enjoyable part of the job, was in direct customer relations."
good,"our goals were met and measured by sales and credit cards.  I participated in floor moves, organizing merchandise, and annual inventory. The hardest part of the job was the annual inventory that would last all night.  I made good friends with my coworkers but there was a high turnover in retail.  The reason I left was to build my career"
good,Interesting but better as a part time job. I enjoyed meeting different people and working with clothes but needed advancement and better pay with benefits.
good,Typical work day saleing shoes. What I learned was all different kinds of shoes. Management was o.k. Co-workers very aggressive. Hardest part sales. Enjoyable part helping customers.
good,"help customers find clothing for there needs. keep area  neat and orderly by finger spacing racks, dusting, folding and cleaning all surfaces.The ASMs' were allways buisy on the floor-making sure all the areas were kept up.  Co workers got along most of the time and helped eachother out if we needed it.  It was a highly competitive retail store. The hardest part of the job was the decline in business over the years.  The easiest part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers find what they were looking for in a positive, upbeat, and efficient way. As well as doing any stock that may have come on the truck. Also there is always straightening to be done as well as changing visuals and mannequins to showcase the newest product. I learned that there will always be someone that doesn't like the amount of work you do, especially if it is more than they want to do. I also learned a tremendous amount about how I would want to run my own business, "
good,"Dillard's is fast-paced. Every day is different. You are constantly working and interacting with customers and associates. Efficient problem solving is key to a successful day. I have learned the importance of effectively managing, training, and improving the morale of associates to exceed sales targets. I have also learned how to identify, recruit, and interview quality talent and how to improve the marketing and appearance of goods to increase sales. The most difficult part of the job was inheriting a workforce that lacks motivation and desire to excel, and effectively changing the culture into a great one. Consequently, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing daily improvement in your associates as they grow and deliver greater results. My colleagues are very diverse in that they all come from different backrounds and have varied degrees of experience, creating a unique and enjoyable environment."
good,I enjoyed the fact that I would get my schedule for a month instead of a week at a time. This made it very easy for me to plan events in my life.
good,"Data analysis, vendor communication, marketing campaigns, store communication"
good,"A day at work would consist of greeting and assisting customers when they come into the store. It can be competitive, sometimes we would have problems because of the need to be competitive. "
good,"well the dillards i am at, will give you an insane sales goal to meet, and put you in the worst section of the store where there are no customer foot traffic, then threaten to cut your paycheck and if you make less than 10 dollars, theyll fire you. so not exactly my best experience at a job. very stressful"
good,Part time job. Heavy customer interaction in various depts.
good,"I sold and promoted perfume fragrances.  I learned much about customer service, how to handle difficult situations with customers, etc.  I really enjoyed helping people pick out a perfume that ""suited"" them.  Their smiles warmed my heart."
good,"I managed the ladies department for about 3yrs. I would reset the floor as needed, do schedules (for about 10-15 people), help customers, sales goals, and signage."
good,"maknig daily sales goals, interaction with customers, credit card payment processing and cash handling."
good,"Very costumer attentive, we will put away stock and make sure everything is always tip-top. I have learned different ways to approach a costumer, and how to cash out a drawer at the end of the night. Management is wonderful. Co-workers are very nice and friendly. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the material down pat. Most enjoyable part is helping a costumer through the process of getting what they exactly want."
good,A typical work day markdown merchandise restock merchandise customer service
good,"I was a sales on the women's side of the perfumes. Would try to sale off the product on the floor. Great communicating with my coworkers and always punctual, always on time."
good,had to leave because they were cutting hours.... co-workers were very friendly
good,"At this job you have to be focused on the customers and yourself."
good,"The hours were okay , only downside was had to work holidays. They were flexible with time off."
good,It was wonderful working with the staff and meeting new people from all over. It was a great experience.
good,"What a great way to learn about the people you share society with, there are all types that work at this company and there are all types that shop at this company."
good,"Although I enjoyed helping customers locate and choose items for purchase, employees were expected to meet sales goals with the threat of having pay reductions of 10% if not met. This made some employees to become aggressive in their sales tactics and literally taking sales away from coworkers by intervening with customers already being helped my another sales associate."
good,Provided customer service and fitted children for shoes. The hardest part of the job was trying to get children that did not want to try on shoes interested in trying on shoes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I was able to satisfy the children as well as the parents.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,A day at work would start out by gathering all the work items that are needed as the new clothes that may of came in and setting up the area to the liking of the managers.
good,"At Dillard's I was a counter manager for Lancome. The job was strongly driven by sales as most department stores are. My daily duties were to lead my counter by example, create schedules for staff, assist customers, and submit daily sales goals."
good,"While working at Dillard's I am responsible for the coaching and the development of my team, as well as the progression of my business. During this process, I've gained confidence, my communication skills have been enhanced, and I've learned that I work well under pressure. The most challenging part of this job is, time management. A lot of demands with minimal time to complete the tasks that are given. The most enjoyable part of this job is teaching. I enjoy watching my team improve upon there skill on a day to day basis, using techniques they learned from me."
good,"attented to costumres and helped selected outfits to their needs ,operating cash registers, cash handle. enjoyed every minutes working there.  Great boss"
good,Lots of fun to browse at the great products while you work. Really cool to unload and set up all the new products. Can be very slow and a little boring at times.
good,"A day at Dillard's starts with completing an hour of stock time, fixing your assigned areas or working on inventory that needs to be placed. Then on to the sales floor engaging in conversation with customers in the area building client relations, gather information about their needs, and building a profile. Then directing the customer to merchandise that fits their needs or wants. If any new product training comes down on the computer those training need to be completed by the due date also."
good,Dealt with assisting customers on the floor that came into my department. Worked the cash register on my floor. Kept all racks within my department stocked and kept all inventory organized for my department. Took classes and was certified to be a fitting specialist for the lingerie department that I worked in. I also helped out in all other departments that did not have enough staff.
good,"I have learned so much from this job, but I am ready to expand my seeling skills."
good,Starting hourly pay is competitive. Typical retail hours.
good,"Customer Service "
good,"Enjoyed the job, I liked the people and the customers.  I learned a lot about customer service.  I enjoyed being a service to others. "
good,"It was a fun place to work, i liked my coworkers. I love working in and with makeup."
good,It is a great place to work if you are good at selling.I was there five years.
good,It was a great place to work at but you had to been there for years to have the client tell!
good,"Working with Dillard's allowed me to work one on one with customers and their individual needs. It was good to know I could support the needs of the individuals that came to me needing clothes, fittings, etc.. "
good,I was a fragrance and beauty consultant. I worked one on one with customers everyday. I loved my job but really did not like how harsh the company was to their employees.
good,Worked as a customer service rep for major Medical Center. Learned and about all computer software
good,I was a mens denim specialist at Dillards. I liked my job and looked forward to being there everyday. The challenges were great and gave me motivation to deliver the customers a good shopping experience. There were quotas to meet and I exceeded everyday. A typical day would be to get my stock out as well as keep the visual aspect of the stock in a place to get good results. My co-workers looked up to me and welcomed my point of view. The hardest part of my job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was making the customers pleased with my service.
good,"Provide supervision and development opportunities for 15 Associates in assigned areas by training, mentoring, assigning duties, providing recognition, and ensuring diversity awareness"
good,It was a typical job but the business was slow. people was nice working with them but I wish they advertise more and get more sales to get customer in 
good,"Great job at first. Pay is based on sales, if you dont meet quarterly goals your pay will be cut. If you  are placed in a generally slow department, it is impossible to meet goals on a regular basis"
good,"Sales and promote company’s products to walk-in customers. Help customers find products that meet their needs and sell customers as many products as possible. Suggesting products, explaining how products work, demonstrating how to use products, and performing makeovers.Operation of cash register. Meet sales goals; build customer relations through follow-up calls, and mailing."
good,"When I started in 2005, they had never had layoffs. They have had 3 or 4 since and I was involved in the most recent one."
good,When i would arrive to work I along with 5 others we would unload the
good,Working at dillard's is very challenging but was a great experience.. It keeps you on your toes.
good,I enjoyed creating display walls and tables and keeping the merchandise organized. That made it easy to assist customers.
good,I loved the position I had. I was working in the cosmetic and fragrance areas! That is the best area for me because I absolutley Love make up and girly things! They did not provide base plus commission at the time I worked here. I wish they had because I sold so well I ran circles around the other sales people. I wish management wasn't so messsed up. I could've been there alot longer. I had a schedule conflict.
good,I learned I do not like a job that uses a sales per hour for your pay.
good,"Help customer pick out a sewing machine, keep my dept. Clean stock shelves"
good,"Working for the company was a good experience, all my co-workers were nice but lazy."
good,"Assisting customers with fast friendly service. Assisting with dressing rooms, putting away new shipments, assisting with the clothing display. Checking out customers at the checkout for their purchase. The management and coworkers all made working their very comfortable. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the commission that was required and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know management and coworkers"
good,"I worked at Dillard's at Lynnhaven for a couple of months and at first I loved it. Then the true attitudes of the people I worked with came out. They seemed to put on a front so you like them and want to be in their department, but once they get you they turn into complete jerks. If you ever wish to apply there whatever you do do not ask for lingerie. That's probably the worst department to ask for. It's extremely hard to get your work done when you have to work with a manager that constantly steals sales from you and makes you work the hardest so she can make all the money."
good,Dealt with customers one on one for cosmetic consultations. Learned how to meet and exceed daily goals. My supervisors were very good at their jobs. My co-workers were very competitive and kept me on my toes. The hardest part of the job was promoting pre-sell events. The best part of my job was being rewarded for being the top sales leader in my area.
good,Stocking shoes and rearranging the stock room several times a week as well as time selling on the floor.
good,I enjoyed working with the public doing this job. and i learned alot about the sales business
good,Business was usually slow at Dillards. But the people were nice.
good,"I liked it, they were just not giving me enough hours. I also was just working through temporary services."
good,A typical day at Dillards is tasking...markdowns and merchandising.
good,"The job itself was enjoyable, however the people I worked with were unfriendly, and rude."
good,sales goals were set and major attempts were made to reach them.
good,Fun place if you enjoy perfume and makeup. All things fashion.
good,"Enjoyed the customers, the hardst part of the job was meeting quota every month. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere."
good,This was my first job out of college and I learned a lot about corporate culture in the B2C environment. Here I learned design and how to better myself within that world.
good,Productive and competitive workplace.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the loyal customers! The employees that worked the longest at this location are the nicest and most helpful. The pay rate is higher than most retailers in the area. In a depressed economy, it is impossible to sell $200 an hour in any department! If you drink the Dillards ""Cool-Aide"" you will definitely be promoted and have a career. If you are not a top selling salesperson, look at this as a temporary job that you could lose any day. Lifespan at this location is one year to two years maximum unless you sell at the high goals they have set for you."
good,Customer service was very big here. It is a department store so they were strict on sales. But overall a fun job.
good,"Meeting new people, Learning about the new products and being able to assist customers, had a great time doing the special event that was planned by our manager"
good,"come in make sure all displays were neat,i learned how to build displays,managers weren't very hands on mostly other employees the hardest part of the job is getting a woman convinced she looked great in a pair of shoes that really didn't"
good,starting pay is good but sales goals are not realistic for small towns.
good,Dillard's is a good place to work which is why I stayed with them for 12 years
good,Cleaning and organizing clothing that different vendors have.
good,"sale per hour you have to maintain, how to sale,management was good, co-worker was cut throats for sales, hardest part of the job is making sure associate didnt steal your sale, winning items from the ventors"
good,worked as a hairdresser...Customer Service was the main focus.
good,"very slow paced at times,learned alot about highend clothing merchanding, inventory,coworkers easy to with but were not allowed to talk between each other much it was all about the customers and selling and making your sales goals.managment strict and kept you on your toes. the hardest part of the job was making sales goals.the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Dillard's is a demanding company to work for, but I learned receiving, pricing, merchandising and people skills. They held you to high standards in sales, dress code and punctuality. I had the most fun in the cosmetic counters because of the different promotions. My co-workers and I had to dress-up for these events. Managment did change quite frequently and to meet the expectations of the new management was some times difficult because each person has different goals."
good,Working for Dillard's I learned how to improve my people skills to put them on a level to help me deal with difficult situations and problems that customers have. I learned how to use the intranet and how to deal with daily sales goals. I've learned to interact more with the customers through our clientele database that we had where you have certain customers that will come in and only shop with you. The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers who take your sales and how not to let it bother you.
good,"A typical day at work would include approaching customers to achieve sales and regular clients for the business. Also, credit applications are a huge deal. I've learned how to order merchandise from computers, a GREAT deal about different types of sheets, small electrics and crystal. In addition, I learned about the different types of china, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to be a great sales person without being overbearing. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with your sales goals when there are no customers. The sales goals are based upon what you have to do to meet your department's goals, nothing to do with flow of customers, average spending amount, etc... The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to do displays, and also the fact that I like most of the people I work with."
good,"I was able to learn how to run a department, new people and how to help customers with there purchase and help what they where looking for."
good,Come in and load or unload a truck
good,"Putting away clothing. Talking to every customer that comes into the department. trying to get a sale. provided assistance with Bra fitting. I learned how to fit each woman into different style of bra's. I took an 8hr class after i fit 75 woman. The management for the department were great. For the store it self was not understanding and had no care to your life at home. My Co-workers were fun, lively and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was hoping i got enough sales and no returns to keep my pay. The enjoyable part of the job was the people and talking with customers."
good,"I learned from working at Dillard's, how important it is to service every Customer on a personal level so that they come back and do business with you. Typical day at work would be fun and full of things to do, take care of each customer and service them the way you would want to be serviced."
good,"I grew up at Dillard's. Working there for nearly 14 years I learned so much about the department store business, relationships, financial plans, gross margin dollars and myself! I enjoyed my time there growing into a great business leader."
good,"Fun and interesting job. However, no free-time, heavy turnover, unreasonable hours, went 32 days with no day off."
good,Great place to work. They have a great focus on customer service.
good,"You are not paid on commission (unless you are in shoes, or an individual brand or vendor is offering that as a spiff), but your pay will increase OR decrease based on your sales. SO, essentially, your hourly rate is based on your sales.Its really, really competitive if you do not get along with your area co-workers or if there is a large age gap in fellow area co-workers. Besides a few exceptions...my experience was the older the worker the more of a sales and tattletail snake the person can be. Many close employees who get along will work together to help everyone achieve their goal so they don't get a pay cut, and if certain co-workers are not in on this underground teamwork, they have likely stolen someones sale(or, most of the time, multiple sales) or have not been friendly. Its a eat or be eaten world at Dillards when you are not on a ""team"". The management at my store was both awesome and awful. Higher management only cared about sales and tardies and thats it. While there were many great ASM's there were also the horrible ones. For the most part each ASM were both great and horrible depending who you asked, but always there was 1 or 2 who everyone liked. You will stand ALL THE TIME, and if you are not used to retail, your feet will hurt alot for the first month, and most of the time the rest of your working time at Dillards. If you make your sales beyond your standard you will be ok with most of the managers unless you are late often or have lots of absences, but if you are one of the top sales people or have the most credit applications under your name in the store"
good,Dillards was a good place for you to work if you love working with the public as well as getting familiar with some of the best high-end brands. The customers were very pleasant and didn't mind spending a certain amount of money even if it meant that they just wanted you to get the sale to increase your quota. I did have repeat customers who looked for myself because of the way I provided great service to them so overall you could meet some very friendly customers while being employed with Dillards.
good,I enjoyed working with co-workers and helping customers.I learned alot about new products on the market.My management team over me was great!I loved working for Dillard's.
good,Compensation package which allowed friendly competition and the opportunity to work as a team.
good,"I had fun working here people are friendly, worked in the mens dept"
good,"You go to work and you make your quota, the management could be better but most of the employees are awesome! You just need to go to work and just do your job."
good,Challenging and rewarding at the same time. This jobs picks up greatly around the Holiday season offering a fast pace experience. Learn the in and outs of sales and presentation techniques.
good,My experience at dillards was up & down they did good by me & did me wrong as well. Good pay. Not a fan of being able to lose money for not reaching a sales goal that's nearly impossible once you reach a certain pay
good,"Depends on the seasons rather it will be slow or not."
good,"Base Pay and Benefits package,is very competitive .Training was pretty well structured,and mentors were very enthusiastic....and environment is pretty laid back .most everyone is easy to get along with.keeping your sales goal is the  challenge...."
good,"Dillard's assigns a sales per hour (SPH) goal to each employee. If these goals are not met then one's pay rate is reduced or an employee can be terminated. It can be very difficult to meet the SPH goals in certain assigned areas and due to the retail business environment of today. Many new inexperienced new-hires start off making more money than employees who have years with the company.  Many new-hires leave with three months. Employees must do markdowns, transfers, merchandising, cleaning, such as dusting, of your assigned areas and visuals."
good,high employee retention. Its very stressful at times. if you don't meet your quota you risk a paycut or possible job termination. They move associates around as they please and does not place them in there area of experience or expertise but where they need them
good,"Sales goals are not realistic in cosmetics, but you are given tools to help achieve some goals.  Cosmetics events are not spaced out as they should be and clients get overwhelmed with events."
good,"There is a mixed bag of employees and management. "
good,"I really enjoyed it when I first started, but as the years have gone on it has gotten worse each year. Each year it's less about the customer and taking care of them and more about getting people to apply for a credit card. If you can't get people to apply for a credit card you are treated as a second class citizen in the workplace."
good,"Experience overall was positive and this can be a good spot for someone who doesn't mind a retail job where you are judged off of numbers.  Associates need to hit certain amounts of sales everyday, and there is not much they give in terms of ongoing or in-depth training for this.  The culture and environment can be pretty peaceful at times."
good,"STRESSFUL!!  But i still gave great expertise on skincare products and make up, demonstrates products with a passion and listens to what the guest concerns are and sales to their needs ,.Make -overs and events. Training and schools. Builds customer relations ,exceeds  sales goals  ,great expertise and advice on beauty products  .Welcoming attitude  ,and friendly customer service."
good,Dillards is very team oriented.  I felt cared about there.  All the management and staff are very friendly and approachable.  I was deeply disappointed when I was insured I had a position back in Muskogee when I left the Tulsa Promenade.  This was not the case.  Dillards in Muskogee had a hiring freeze.
good,Fun place to work unless you don't sell. Not enough incentive driven opportunities. A very cutthroat atmosphere where people would take your sales opportunities if not on top of it.
good,"While I disagreed with culture shift at Dillard's regarding customer always right mentality, the Company has prospered and remained very competitive with other retailers regarding technology and customer buying habits."
good,Quality of life balance is not proportionate. The amount of time and the pressure to produce numbers make daily life with this company very intense and high pressure.
good,"Working at Dillards most days are pretty easy I've worked in both the dock and the women shoes sales floor and you work hard in both places and show you are quite the worth, but management does not see that and hardly acknowledges the fact you are a quality associate. Ive enjoyed other coworkers. a lot is expected when you are supposed to make a lot back from a draw in commission based pay which does not provide good enough percentages to make back the money they paid you out for."
good,"Retail Sales Representative, Sep 2015 - December 2017 "
good,"the bosses have favoritism for some associates, sometimes are rude and its a lot pressure to sale, a lot time associate fight for a sale, specially in cosmetics"
good,Dillard's is a great place to work depending on your store managers and area sales managers. I've went through periods of loving it there and then hating it. Managers are in and out
good,"Working for Dillards in the Juniors clothing department could be very challenging. Customer could be very unkind and very messy. A job that will definitely teach patience and tolerance. Duties were to keep sales and moral up, do product returns, rearrange the department fixtures as need according to clothing groups,whats new or popular and what season of the year it was. They did let employees know when other positions were available and ask if they were interested. The sales percentage expectations were a bit high considering that if some returned an item sold under your name it went against you sales percentage. The did offer bonuses for employees that had good/high sales. I would work retail again, but depends where and what store is offering employment."
good,I liked my job at Dillards at customer service. I would not want a job as a sales representative on the floor selling handbags or perfume. I feel like it's too cut throat
good,"from 2001(start)management was fine, 40 or more hours to November 2005. In dec.2005 Management changed(store manager and my dept. supervisor) and things went down hill, I never was returned to fulltime."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service from Dillard's. I learned how to take care of someone else's need and how to go above and beyond for each customer, there are different needs and aspect. I learned that with clients you can become close with customers. The most enjoyable part is selling, I liked to be kept busy, and talking to customers. I learned how to manage time with keeping the cash wrap clean,stockings, and taking care of customers. Juggling responsibilities during the day is fun, because there is always something to do."
good,Dillard’s was cool experience it was my first retail job I learn a lot about merchandising and etc . I’m a party cool culture  I love sales and customer service I had a blast
good,Sales is their only concern. Nothing personal is kept inside the office. If you want to advance in the company avoid bully managers. I enjoyed my clients they made my day.
good,being able to not only be a sales associate but for my manager to help me and really get my feet wet on the marketing side was amazing. from being able to do displays for our commercials to displays not only for our stores but other Dillard's around.
good,Dillard's was a fun place to work. There is  advancement for the employees. Worked well with your schedule especially if you are a college student. The hardest part of the job was meeting your sales goals and opening up new credit card accounts.
good,I love working at Dillard’s because of my co workers and my customers because I really got to know my usuals and become more of a personal shopper to them then a sales associate.
good,They can fire you for almost anything. Don't make your managers mad at you because they can retaliate and get away with it. Most of the managers let their emotions get the best of them.
good,"Dillards was a mediocre company to work for.  There were few opportunities for advancement and little social interaction amongst the staff.  Generally, you feel like you are working for a large, indifferent company."
good,Worked with a great group of people who were all very driven. Clear expectations and achievable goals. Ended up leaving company because store manager went back on my approved days off two weeks before my trip because of a sale the store was having.
good,"Unrealistic sales goals placed upon employees, not willing to compromise when goals are not met. Various coworkers were fired with no notice for being just a few dollars short of their sales quotas."
good,"I did not like coming to work because of the manager I had. I felt like I was doing more than everyone else and did not get any recognition. They were more worried about numbers than the employees. I would not recommend working for this company in Anderson, SC."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard's for a little while, but the job became monotonous and the hours were too much for my school schedule. I would recommend it to someone wanting to work retail for good pay."
good,Excellent workplace culture that values employee contributions and offers opportunities for sales associates to move into management positions.  Benefits were lacking.
good,"working at dillards is okay, but you have to go after your sales, or else you won't make your sales goals. the benefits and incentives are pretty nice sometimes, well at east at my store they are."
good,It seemed overly difficult and political to get hired full time to the company from seasonal temp. was pretty disappointed by this because I really enjoyed the work environment
good,"Lacking on follow up trainings. Needs more one on one training. Promotion based on sales preformers. Dress code to relaxed. Store manager and most operations managers spend to much time in their office, need more associate and customer interaction.Great fashion and trends good at meeting customer needs, associates over load with Mark downs store directives are unable to give customer the time needed to meet customer needs"
good,I worked for Dillard's for two year and I'll just say it a different experience. It starts off really good because of the pay but once you see all of the things you have to deal with and go thru the pay doesn't matter to the amount of stress you go through once you walk in those doors. You will only succeed here if the managers like you
good,"on a daily basis I would keep my area tidy, I would assist customers and ring sales using a Dillards specific computerized register."
good,"Some days are better than others"
good,"Dillard's puts making as much money as possible first and foremost. The system is set that you must make impossibly high daily quotas. If you fall short, then you have a running deficit on your card, but if you manage to make more than you goal, the excess does not carry over. It is extremely cutthroat. It is expected that everyone should be a team player, but if you wish to advance, you must actually step on your coworkers to make your goals. If you do not, you are subject to losing pay and/or your job, regardless of how good a worker you may be in other areas. It was a daily occurence seeing some people do nothing but stand around or literally stalk customers when other tasks needed to be done. Those tasks would then be placed on others to do, which consistently caused their quotas to flag."
good,"Learned a lot about myself working here. It can be super competitive, stressful & draining. Wish they did focus so much on SPH, but more of the quality of service. Love my clients!"
good,"great pay , work alot and work over time, great pay, wasnt bad, couldnt have my cell phone, breaks fair game, concrete hard floor, some days was  cold"
good,I learned so much working retail at Dillards.l met people from all over the world and I built my wardrobe up too. I established friendships that will last a lifetime.
good,"I enjoyed working here for a while, but i realized it was very cut throat. had to make a specific sales goal everyday, that sometimes was impossible. Management wasn't always on top of thing."
good,Dillards company was a challenging company with very ridged employee rules. I was very successful as a sales associate and department manager. After 10 years I was asked to moved on to a smaller retail store with a co-worker from Dillards
good,"loved my coworkers, beautiful work space, clean breakroom, benefits, tough management team, not customer friendly,loved going into work and interacting with coworkers, spa room was great for client facials"
good,"Based on the goals they set for you, they are a little unfeasible when working with people who have been there 20 years or longer. If you want to sharpen your shark like skills, it's an excellent place to work for."
good,overall this job was a good place to work. They put more focus on just pushing sales than maintaining a good quality in customer service a upkeep. ...
good,Dillards is a great place to work for those who love interacting with customers everyday and genuinely enjoy helping people find what they're looking for.
good,The company is very behind on times and their product can be better. You do get paid based off of performance so monthly you are evaluated and after 6 months you could be let go based off of your performance for me selling wasn't great because I focused so much time on tasking but because I was exceptional at it they didn't want me to leave. Tasking is done during your selling hours which is extremely difficult depending on your store and department.
good,"Worked with customers throughout the day, stocked merchandise and re-printed and re-ticketed new markdowns. Continued learning customer service skills."
good,"The company pays well for part time and full time employees, however the clothing selection could be better. If the selection was better it would be easier to meet sale goals that are required to continue increasing pay."
good,Dillard's is a good place to work in and management is pretty good as well. Not only am I gaining even more customer service experience but I am also learning other things as committing to sale goals and how to work as a team.
good,"Ever changing days, sales, visual , promotions , display and more are all part of the daily grind. Incredible staff and wonderful customers are a perfect way to start the day."
good,This job is a competitive job which is good for people who are competitive at heart. At times it could be fast or slow-paced depending on the day and times. Overall this isn't a bad job just has to do a better job with wanting to give the employees a better and effective way to sell the products in the store.
good,"talking and engaging in customers, I learn that you cant force people to purchase products, management team is really nice and understanding. hardest part is the possibility of getting a pay cut due to not making sales. enjoyable part is always helping the customer feel good about themselves and what they purchased"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work. Met wonderful customers and I developed a clientele. "
good,Working at Dillard's was ok. Customer services representative was a big step. I loved setting up the displays. Some day people would be rude. Its was bad. I enjoyed working there.
good,"It's at good company to gain customer service experience however, can be a very stressful environment to work in at times. However, if the management was better the work environment will improve."
good,"Its retail very demanding sales goals. Meet the goal never beat the goal unless your in a proper department or you are a crack sales person who can meet the aggressively creeping sales goals."
good,Salary managers are difficult good for locking people in the stores.  But I enjoy the people I worked with the big issue about departments but other than that I enjoyed working for them. You have a lot of feet and corn's aching because you must wear heels.
good,"As a college student, I got as many hours as I wanted (below 30). They were very flexible with my schedule. I can see how it would be difficult to meet sales goals working full time."
good,"A typical day would require a sales goal to be reached, as well as maintaining the floor the sales floor. I learned a lot about customer service and the competitive nature of sales. The hardest part of the job was reaching the goals they established for the day, month and year. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"Being a full-time college student, Dillard's was good (not great) with working around my school schedule. They have decent pay and multiple opportunities to increase your pay. Dillard's is definitely not meant to be a long-term job unless you enjoy working every weekend. It is a sales job so you do have to meet certain goals, which leads to a competitive work environment. I have nothing great to say about the management. If you're looking for a short-term job with decent pay then Dillard's might be for you!"
good,"While working here i had issues pushing the company credit card, which not every customer wanted or already had. the location i worked at was a low traffic store so during downtime there is a lot of organizing and reorganizing of the same displays. After the initial probationary period employees are allowed to choose from a variety of benefits and full time employment if desired."
good,They pay well but since you keep your job based on sales the environment is pretty competitive. I worked part time and my hours varied from 13-29.5 hours per week
good,Pays well not promising! Never know when your going to get let go. It's good after you've been there 10 plus years that's all I have to say really why do I jeee to write this
good,"The primary job occupation for anyone not in management at Dillard's is salesman. There's no commission, only quotas. This leads to very new faces on the floor trying to sell product they might be unfamiliar with, and a ""compete against your coworkers"" attitude versus a ""work together"" type one. The experienced salesman secure their sales through the means they know, which includes taking them from new staff, giving very little time for learning, if any. At my store you quite literally fought tooth and nail between salesman or ended up somewhere else. I never claimed to be the best salesman, but I never wanted to be a cutthroat one either. Only recommended for experienced salesman. Extremely high turnover rate."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much.  My fellow employees were great! There were a couple  people that just liked to cause problems within the department but I just kept to myself and avoid getting involved."
good,i liked working at Dillard's cause i got along with a lot of people and i was very helpful to customers and i worked extra when they needed me to
good,A typical day you come in and clock in. You check your computer and see what your daily quota is can also watch some videos about the season and what's in style or not. You would also greet you co-workers with whom you all are kind of in competition with to make your sales. Then you pretty much do that for the remaining day and of your closing you make sure all items are stored away and in their respective places before leaving for the night.
good,"Make sure counter was properly stocked and clean. Check individual/counter goals for the day. Designate, motivate and review goals with team. Recruit customers in store with excellent customer service. Customer phone calls. "
good,I enjoyed working for customer service. It taught me how to multi task. Enjoyed the Managers they are very supportive in helping you achieve your goals in life.
good,Must be on top of sales in order to be stress free for the company. They are open to schedule changers if notified in advance. Good paying job.
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customer and putting out new merchandise. I learned great customer service skills, the management team there is okay, I had some of the most amazing co-workers (sales associates). The hardest part is balancing the workload and your personal life. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and co-workers"
good,"Supervised, merchandised, scheduled, set goals sales & credit,"
good,"Very fast past  and competitive in a commission base environment."
good,"Overall, the job was good. I was expected to sell a lot of merchandise and required to sign people up for credit cards. I liked working with the customers but did not like to push sales that were not right for the customer. I loved interacting with the workers and the customers very much and liked helping others."
good,Worked part time over a period of months after working a full day job.  Co-workers were helpful and willing to assist.  Hardest part was dealing with rude customers and keeping dressing room tidy when groups came and try on many dresses and/or gowns.   Enjoyed seeing the new colors and styles for each season as we put out merchandise and store discount for employees.
good,Good place to work if you love retail.  They arn't to picky about being on time since most of the employees are part time.  Customer service reps also handle the cash office and that is very stressful especially if you don't have teamwork.
good,"* Hustle Hustle Hustle. It seemed to be a numbers game and not about the customers. A typical day consisted of hounding the customers and stepping on co-workers toes to make ends meet"
good,"Dillards created an upscale shopping experience that focused on quality product and service.  Expectations were high for sales associates but quality was rewarded biannual and annually.  "
good,"Daily Sales meetings start the day to keep everyone in the loop as to store status, store sales and introduction of new products.  Opening of registers in assigned department.  Most Co-Workers are great."
good,"nice place to work at.."
good,"This company is still difficult to work for. Some of the managers are great, but they leave early because this company does not believe in good employees."
good,"Fun and professional workplace, a typical day at work would consist of doing your 1 hour stock time at arrival.  After this, we were suppose to go out to the sales floor and focus on customer service needs to gain our sales.  Management was ok, it is such a big store that they would not always get things done in time.  I got a long with all of my co workers, but the hardest part of the job was to keep your sales on a day to day basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a friendly place, you dress professionally.  Bonus and commission was good as well."
good,"Work with different cultures, it was fun and fast to know the customers and associates.•	"
good,"The typical day consisted of opening, counting my areas registers, making sure any extra stock was put away, keeping the department presentable while assisting customers and trying to persuade them into getting the right shoes for them."
good,"Sales are not steady day to day."
good,"Stable company, good people, learned a lot about retail accounting and internal controls.  Worked in most areas of accounting and finance over 20 year period.  Gray cubicles were not enjoyable.  Friendly co-workers."
good,"Between the slow, eight-hour shifts spent closing the store and processing stock; the tiresome morning shifts that start at seven in the morning; and the hectic days spent loading stock to be transferred to the outlet stores; working as a support associate at Dillard's has felt more like an effort in futility than an advancing career. However, as stagnant as this job has proven, polite and understanding faces in the administration and on the sales floor (and a much-needed pay rate) has made working at Dillard's a routine part of my day-to-day. My experience at Dillard's has led to an understanding of how working in the corporate sales industry works, and a level of patience that might not have been otherwise acquired. Despite the adversity of an unpleasant daily regiment, the experience of it all has made it worth the time spent."
good,"A typical morning at Dillard's started off with a meeting where our floor manager would discuss our daily goals and upcoming events."
good,Typical day at work was slow with large rushes of people at random times. Management could've been better. Hardest part of the job was searching through inventory online for customers.
good,"-Management is great. Every experience is different, but my managers have always been great. I lucked out every time I've worked for Dillard's and have had awesome managers. Some managers aren't very flexible or professional. "
good,Dillard's is a typical department store with pros and cons as any other large company. I enjoyed going to work each day and always on time. I looked forward to seeing who would be coming in and waiting on them with their fashion needs. I particularly enjoyed doing merchandizing for the store as I could use my design skills and product placement.
good,"Your job isn't secure at all. If you don't meet your quota, your hours will be cut. Wonderful benefits for employees, but if you are looking for a stable job, Dillards isn't the place to be."
good,"An excellent store for customers expecting quality products. "
good,Dillard's is a great place to get things done. There is always something to keep yourself busy.
good,"My typical work day was very productive "
good,Working @ VS was fun. There were always fun girls to interact with and helping the customers find their perfect fit was a gift in its self. The lack of opportunity for advancement was the only reason I resigned. I miss my VS team!!
good,I worked in a very slow department so the typical day would be slow. I would open up the truck and put stock out on truck days. I would create displays when my manager gave us projects. Management wasn't very organized. I had 3 different managers in 4 months. The store itself changed out managers often. My co-workers were nice but competitive at the same time. They would try to steal sells all the time. The hardest part was opening up truck because there were a lot of heavy boxes. The best part about working at Dillards was I got to work in a mall setting.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers, the worst part of the job was the managements inability to work cohesively with their team. I learned upselling, customer relations and time management."
good,"My day at Dillards would start with a team meeting.  Gather all the sales associates and try to pump them up for the best day ever.  Markdowns and/or markups.  Set the floor to a plan-o-gram or other schematic.  Loss prevention(an hour per day) per manager.  Inventory. Schedules for 50+ people... done a month in advance.  Monitor sales and plan events to drive sales."
good,providing excellent customer service to every client.leave a lasting impression with every client.
good,I loved working for Dillard's I would clock in at 9:45am and I would be there until 5:00 My co worker and I would put out clothes and dress the front of our station. the hardest was when we had to move the floor around because I couldn't wait on all my customers. The most enjoyable was the people
good,Over all this is a pretty good company to work for and you are very well compensated however if you are coming from the outside into management expect no training whatsoever. All training is self taught and there is no sympathy or adjustment period. You are expected to adapt quickly.
good,"Fun environment to work in, but a stressful company to work for."
good,"Arrive at 7 am, clean the store until 10 am, proceed to sort and load product either into the store or unload product from a truck."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,Good work conditions with the caveat that they do not work with students around their schedules.
good,"The particular store I worked at was in a mall that didn't see a lot of business, so that highly affected the amount of sales an associate could make. However, I formed good relationships with almost all of my coworkers and managers, which in turn made for a good work environment."
good,A great part time position.  Good for student or as a second job.
good,"I had stockroom work each day. Each day there was a sales goal each employee has to reach. Most days were good days, leniency was helpful when it came to mistakes."
good,"Decent scheduling, great pay, but no job security. Department managers work with you, scheduling wise. Friendly, welcoming environment from most. "
good,"management  was great, most enjoyable job i worked for, my supervisor was a great boss and co workers are very nice to worked with."
good,Very busy work environment. Worked long hours. I was left doing the work load alone while other new young employees stood around not taking their job seriously.
good,"Dillard's pays employees well, gave compensation a t sales and provided discount for empoyees"
good,"Typical day at work would be to come in get money bags a scanning gun open register get called for a meeting they open store you either have a trolley of clothes to put away or you have markdowns to do while taking care of customers. "
good,"The hours were great and the hourly pay was great as well, but the pay was only as good as it was because because of how hard you were forced to work to keep the pay. It was a commissioned based job and when the business was good the pay was great, but when the business was bad and even if things were returned it was held against you. I loved my co workers and I thought the managers were great, the job is easy but the commission park really made it difficult hence the high turnover rate."
good,great attention to customer service and plenty of advancement opportunities and great raise opportunities.
good,"Overall working here was quiet boring needed something to do doing the summer, so it was great job had to get commission in some work areas. It was a pretty quiet interesting job as far as meeting new people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was customer relations. Whether it was building a sale, handling a complaint, or simply talking with customers, helping someone find the best value and quality for their money is my passion. Schedules were due the second Thursday of every month, and I was always punctual about submitting them on time. The job is very past paced, and someone in the management program has to be able to learn very quickly, often on the fly. The first two locations I worked at, Spanish Fort, AL and Lafayette, LA were great. The third and last location in Alexandria, LA wasn't a good fit for me. I felt as though my job was that of a Loss Prevention Specialist more than a Men's Department manager, which isn't what I wanted to do. The hardest part of the job for me was probably this, and the associated threats that followed a particularly high dollar theft stop. I always maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity in these situations, however, as I strive to do in my day to day life."
good,"Area Sales manager is the hardest position in the entire company. Highly stressful, minimum of 50 hours a week, high expectations with little support from upper management. Expectations include driving a sales increase no matter the traffic flow of the entire store, managing associates while answering pages for the entire store. The most enjoyable part is getting to work with the customers. Being able to change how they feel about themselves after you are able to work with them is very satisfying."
good,"A typical day at work consists of superb customer service, understanding and being able to appropriately address the customer's needs. I've learned great customer service skills, very good selling tactics, important product knowledge, and how to accurately follow company protocol. Management at the company constantly pushes us to be perfect associates and to succeed in living up to all their expectations. Co-workers are friends, confedants, and also competition, but more often than not respect your sales. The hardest part of the job is having to meet a quota when there is no one to sell to, and having to meet many goals and many expectations while still having to focus on so many other duties can be very challenging and many times can feel like all the tasks at hand are near to impossible to meet. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to meet amazing people in my customers and being able to give someone a make over and transform their perception of themselves. Making someone feel beautiful or helping someone find the perfect gift for a loved one and being able to connect with them on a personal level is the best part of my job."
good,"Customers are friendly; not many unpleasant encounters. Very good pay for retail work. Small advancement is quick and easy. Advancing further means waiting for someone to retire or transfer, so the opportunities are not great. Snooty, cut-throat selling environment. Upper management looks at numbers, not customer satisfaction or all the other work you do besides sell. Quota system is outdated and needs changed to commission. Good discount on merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty slow for me since I did housekeeping most of the days. One thing I learned was how to multitask. There's nothing wrong with communication but you have to learn to manage your work skills into that. The management was okay. There were a few things they needed to work on. Being prepared on a job is a big thing to me and they did a lot of scrambling. The co-workers are friendly, lovable people. They made the customers, even me feel like i was at home. The hardest part of the job was when people mixed personal life with work life. Those two do not go hand in hand especially when you have to work with each other. There's a line people shouldn't cross. I went there to work and work only. Working is what I love doing so i steered away from things that weren't work appropriate. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and being able to socialize. Working is in my soul and it's what I love doing."
good,"Even though the hours and pay are great, the work day was very slow and if you did not meet your goals for eight consecutive months, you were let go"
good,Was offered job in ladies clothing department and they asked me to change to COACH before my employment date. I made COACH specialist by meeting sales quotas. Co-workers were for the most part wonderful. I was not in agreement with some's lack of work ethic. But I guess that is the difference in a small store and big department store.
good,I really loved working for Dillard's. The people were very nice. Open door policy.
good,"Dillard's is an OK company to work for. They pay excellent hourly pay, at least when I worked there. They do push for sales quotas everyday. They give you a certain amount of time to meet your quotas, 3-4 months. If you do not meet your sales goal (quota) after your probation they will cut your salary. Problem is store is not that busy during the week. There is a lot of competition between employee's because of goals"
good,This was a good place to seek advancement opportunites but since it has a monthly sells quota it was kind of stressful some days.
good,Fun environment. I worked with a great group of hardworking pace setters with a fun sense of humor.
good,"I interact with customers all day. I enjoy working with people; helping them. I have learned many things at this job. Besides the light accounting and auditing, it has mostly brought out my personality a lot. I have learned that I'm actually quite well with customers and I make them feel at ease in a professional way. My manger is the operationals manager. She is fantastic. My only problem with the management is sometimes I feel like just another number in the payroll. There are many co-workers, which bring many personalities. I tend to get a long with all of them. Some I have made close friends with and must say that they help with the enjoyable part of the job."
good,I worked as a teachers assistant for special ed in a middle school. This job was rewarding and fulfilling because you got to help kids first hand with behavioral or academic issues. Formed great relationships with staff and students.
good,"I will not lie about this job it is stressful because you work with personal daily sales quotas which you must fight to get or else lose your job. I learned that I am totally good when it comes to sales. Management it is really not good, as long as you are making your sales they do not care about you.... Co-workers are the enemy on the sales floor so you have to learn to trust and to defend your sales. The hardest part of the job was always watching your back from co-workers who want to make a bad on you. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at work included handling cash, meeting the needs of customers, stocking and cleaning."
good,A typical day at work varies by the tasks I create myself. If I am aware of something that does not appear the way it should I correct the problem and make it better and more appealing. Once I open my register I usually head on the floor and make sure the sales-floor is being well-maintained and up to par. I've learned to suggestive sale and how to communicate with a variety of families and how to handle various situations from the nice customer to the most aggressive. I also learned responsibility since I do open and close my own cash register and have the freedom to arrange and organize my department how I see fit. Management is great they consider our opinions as a way the store will function. My co-workers are great. Although there is a lot of competition amongst us all we have a nice solid co-worker relationship. The hardest part of my job is probably the competition with other co-workers and adjusting to different types of family and how they like their store experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and greeting people from all walks of life. I believe it is absolutely amazing.
good,"Good atmosphere to work. Felt good to dress and look your best every day. Sales goals don't account for area or time year, so that can be stressful when business is slow. The credit program was a big pain to push sometimes. Loved the employee discount and free merchandise perks. Management usually nice enough, though unsympathetic if you fall behind on sales or credit numbers."
good,I enjoyed working at Harry and David; the product is exceptional and easy to sell; I also enjoyed being assistant manager; the women I hired were also self motivating and easy to work with.
good,Management set very high expectations for sales. I met them for 9 years until retail started to head into a slumber with internet sales on the rise. I tried my best but just didn't have the sales and was terminated because of the sales ceiling.
good,"Customer traffic was very light so associates couldn’t make their quota in the allotted time. This worried employees of losing their job, which caused some people to get fired and find another job. Not because of a lack of work, but lack of traffic."
good,"If you arent meeting your quota, you will be fired. That has to be the most stressful, if there arent customers then i cant sell! And the company doesnt get that, you'll be replaced in an instant. Definitely just get the experience and go."
good,"If you like high end fashion and like to shop, this job is for you. However, getting stabbed in the back goes along with the position. I worked maintenance for them. I had to hurry in the mornings to get things done before the stores would open because once the store was open you were not to be seen. God forbid that something would actually get repaired because their self diagnosis of being perfect would be tarnished."
good,It was very difficult to make shift dollar totals with the amount of traffic the store had after 5:00pm. It was also difficult earning quotas working with 19 year sales associate veterans who had established large customer bases.
good,Love and miss my coworkers and my managers .. Great inviroment . great place .. Great sales ... Great management . good place to work and nice and clean
good,A typical day starts by checking the numbers for the department and checking into the associates daily task as well as their sales. Afterwards taking the time to coach them and help them improve. I've learned how to navigate through our computer systems along with how to plan out the business for the month.
good,"Wasn't a bad job for the most part, but as a dock worker, you are the bottom tier and treated as such. No raises allowed ever and no where to move up to. It starts as a dead end job and stays that way."
good,"Good discount for employees"
good,Good potential for promotions only to a certain point. I haven never met a person on the corporate side in a senior level management position that has worked for the company for less than 20 years.
good,"goals are easy to obtain, you just have to focus on the department you are in, maintain your goals. shoes are where the money is. you can make around 65k a year in shoes alone."
good,"It was a part time job, just to be out from the routine life but enjoyed working there thoroughly. Always achieved my sales goals.It was fast paced but not stressful."
good,"Everyone was very cut throat it was very competitive, management had their favorites and would help favorites with sales quotas and training but not everyone was treated the same"
good,"busy selling, customers can be tough sometimes but selling something they love and you believe in is great. Management and inventory days including holiday work is hard"
good,"have to compete for sales"
good,Dillards was a great place to work. The people I worked with were great. The management was effective and caring. I worked lost prevention though so I didn't have to interact with the customers.
good,Good pay raise often. Super stressful had to make quotas or you were cut. Area manager were great but the store manager was unrealistic. Fun you can be creative.
good,"Stable hours, plenty to do, expect to keep pretty busy for the majority of your shift. You have to meet your quota of sales and exceed expectations each time, or else your employment comes under fire. Managers are extremely understanding as a counter, but it creates a very aggressive work environment. I saw co-workers ""steal"" sales from each, usually when the others back was turned for a few minutes at a clothes rack. Additionally, promotion seems to be mostly mythological, any time a spot opened up, upper management would bring in someone from another store to fill the position, internal promotion was not even on the table. Otherwise, good pay, great benefits (if you can get them), and an employee discount that stacked with whatever sales were going on at the time. Many of my best shirts and suits that I own today were from my time at Dillards, which I got at approximately 5% of the original price."
good,"Easy going."
good,"While the management was amazing, the shifts were very slow and very few customers came in making the sales goals too high to reach. The best part was the pay and the worst was constantly having to fear for your job because you could barely reach your sales goal."
good,"Great part time for college students very flexible hours, rather high pay for amount of work, not stressful and low amount of hours a week. Constantly recommend working here if in-between jobs."
good,typical day was busy but pay was good and hours were to but not enough managers and got left with alot of responsibility for how much i was being paid
good,"You must be able to sell or get a pay cut. Fun people work there."
good,"Dillard's has changed with the last 2 years of working here. Working  for this company can be challenging, if your not able to adapt to their systems."
good,"There is great pay, benefits, hour lunch breaks and flexible hours. The downside is the very competitive sales goals without many client traffic. Co-workers unprofessional with unnecessary drama and gossip."
good,Dillard's is a good place to work during the holiday season. It is a fast paced store. They give you a quota to sell and you must make it daily or try to play catch up during the following shift. If you don't catch up you will always be in the negative
good,"checking numbers on daily monthly and yearly goals, coaching  and training staff. Complete markdowns and RTV's in a timely manner. Recruiting and staffing all departments."
good,"Dillard's is a hard place to work"
good,"I like working part time at Dillards. Dillard's has helped me to stay abreast of the latest clothing lines for men and women, shoes, bedding and home store items. They also have a great choice in the fragrance line."
good,"Not always a pleasant environment, payed by commission,sometime employees arguing over customers,  sometime customers bring merchandise back  lose incentive"
good,This store has everything you need clothing shoes jewelry you name it. Alot of clothing on discount too it could be men women kids anything your looking for they will have.
good,Management does not care about their employees. They take your weekends off from you. Expect you to work all the time and get customers to open Dillards credit cards
good,"Dillards dock workers only work 28 hours a week, albeit that work schedule is guaranteed and you'll never receive anything less. While the rest of Dillards employees can advane, receive full time and annual raises, dock workers do not get any of these benefits. It's almost a given that other employees in the store will treat you lowly for working on the dock, at least at the Norman location I worked at for a year. Management is mostly typical, can be hard-headed about things as small as just being right in a discussion about work-related issues. Spite the cons I experienced working at Dillards on the dock, the job was convenient, provided paychecks weekly, kept my work schedule in check with minimal changes and gave me a chance to get in shape a little bit through the physical demand. Overall I rate Dillards a solid 3/5 stars."
good,I was placed in the shoe department promised that I was going to make commission evey month along with my hourly pay. I  have recieved commission one time in the year that I have been there. I have been in deficit for five months and worried that I won't be able to get out and they will let me go.
good,"I really recommend Dillard's for what the gave me. The pay was nice and you got your check every week. With all that, the place was a big mess. Your schedules were never printed out on time so associates would be all over the place stealing customers from other associates."
good,Pay was decent for part-time (what you start off as) workers were nice and friendly. Managers were not so friendly. Some favored other departments. Company events
good,A typical day consists of helping customers based on their needs while also making your sale quota each day. Management is good depending on the department you are in.
good,There is always room for advancement wether you want a career as a selling specialist or to move up on the latter.  Management is always very helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working there. The job was fun, the employees are amazing. There are a few things I don't agree with but the jobs is fun with career advancements."
good,"every day is interesting "
good,"As I worked diligently to grow the business, I learned how to build customer retention through follow up phone calls and sending notes of appreciation for continuing to purchase products."
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. The company is family operated. It's a profit sharing company, so your hard work and dedication pay off!"
good,"A learning , company allowing you to be productive and give you input and allowing you to use your ideas to make your department  profitable."
good,"the work day is long 9:50 to 7 or 11 to 9:20"
good,"Great people to work with and love the clientele.  Local management wonderful team.  "
good,"Great Pay. Training was nonexistent, but the job was easy to learn. The job is competitive. Older coworkers tend to manipulate the newer coworkers in order to still clients. Working with customers was great. Management unprofessionally yells at employees on the floor in front of customers. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they need. Personal shopping for customers was allowed and encouraged."
good,Dillards is a great place to work. The pay is great and the staff is very pleasant. We just went through a change in Senior Mgmt and so far the changes have been pretty good.
good,Most days were long hours and all standing. High sales quotas required for your pay rate. Management needed help. While employed here they changed managers. The new one shifted people around and out of the departments they were trained in. Once shifted  most did not succeed. If you were moved from one department to another your quotas could be less but most times it increased. This required more sale per hour and made it very hard to reach your goals. Coworkers were hard to get along with due to everyone needed sales so many would take your sales.The hardest part of the job was reaching required sales quotas.There had been fights over coworkers taking sales.There was few coworkers who made it enjoyable. They help train you and would help you out if you struggled.
good,"Manage, train, motivate, and coach staff associates in commissioned sales. A great place to sharpen your selling skills. Dillard's promote from within; you can start as an associate and train for future management opportunities."
good,There is a lot of competition on the sales floor. There is plenty of opportunity for advancements. The hardest part of the job would be meeting sales quota.
good,"Good environment, you must enjoy sales and building relationships with people. Always focus on your self and your goals."
good,"My father owns the business, i would come in when i have extra time to help him with paper work, and phone calls, and with whatever else came up that needed to be handled"
good,"I felt like dillards didn't care much for there employees never had a holiday party for the employees , I ask for a transfer request from store mgr and was informed the day I arrived in nevada I wasn't getting it because of my sph and its funny I just got my review in december given to me by assist. Store  mgr. And it was excellent and now my sales don't meet the guide lines when I was only part time. No wonder dillards is the no.2 Worst company to work for."
good,"Dillards can be a great job depending on location. If your store generally has good sales, so will you and its pretty much smooth sailing. But if your store is generally slow, then you are expected to meet sales goals even if its not possible because of continuous slow traffic."
good,"The job in itself is ok. There are times when there may be a bit of conflict when dealing with certain situations, but overall it is ok."
good,The majority of the Assistant Managers were great to work for. My co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and merchandising the products. The compensation was great but there was not much room for advancement. There was a lot of micro-managing which sometimes made it difficult to get your work done. It could be a highly stressful environment. It was next to impossible to have a life if you worked full time. It would be a good job for a college student looking to work part time but not necessarily a good job for a professional adult looking to work full time.
good,Your growth and success is based about the region/district you are located in.  Some District Managers are lost when it comes to family life.  I enjoyed my time with Dillards very much but my DM ended my relationship poorly by not accepting my transfer.
good,"Sales, Sale, Sale"
good,Management has a good grasp of the work requirements and environment.  They will work with you to make sure you get the most out of your employment.
good,Start day out by opening draw put out any stock. Assist customers in applying and purchasing cosmetic and skincare. Maintain a customer log. Closed at least 2 nights a week. Great management team. Everyone got along well. The hardest part about the job was making sure you met you hourly sales goal. Coolest part about my job was free products
good,"You are the customers personal shopper, a lot of finger spacing and organizing, color coordinating loved most of the customers."
good,"The pay is very good for retail but sales quotas can be hard to maintain for the most part especially during the summer months. You can also expect working almost every weekend. The work environment is also very competitive which can lead to unhappy co-workers. Some people either last serval years or only about one year. Overall, it's great to learn and awesome pay but be ready to handle several different things at once."
good,"I somewhat enjoyed my experience with Dillard's. Had a great boss who was the assistant store manager who really cared about the employees and worked really hard. It was great for a while, employees came and went in my department quick for a couple months. Had a lot of fun working there. HOWEVER, training was not very well done and most of what I knew I learned on my own. Had very little full price traffic come through and many customers were rude at that particular location and would haggle over extremely cheap pricing. The computer system is very easy to learn if you take your down time to play with it. If new employees came you had to train them which is why training was often no good for some. We had a lot of credit application pressure but one a week was reasonable compared to other places and a credit class on Sunday was not bad either. If you are a hard working employee but have bad traffic coming through then you stand no chance. Once that sale goal disappears in the system it is only a matter of time. Management was okay beyond the ASM but sketchy and lied unless you confronted them. Had to rearrange the department often and it was rarely to what Dillard's actually wanted but we were forced to redo and redo. If they are in a pinch for a manager, instead of hiring within or looking even they will just pick whatever sketchy lazy person they are friends with and competition for sales is huge. Pay is good though if you can keep your job. Every 3 months you're suppose to get reviewed for pay raise and such but the management that this location did not do so which will make"
good,Dillards brought a lot of enjoyment to my day. As employees we were allowed some freedom with our sales techniques as long as they remained productive. It was a competitive atmosphere which constantly keeps you on your toes. There was a high turn over rate as far as management is concerned but it allowed a diverse working community which I enjoyed very much.
good,"working for dillard's was a fun experience ,the people for the most part were great ,nice friendly ,professional,hard working ,easy to get along with ,and would help out anytime,management was o k .i did not have much contact with that though.the afternoon breaks were nice     got to sit and chat for a min."
good,It is a great retail company to work for. The hours are some of the best when it comes to the retail life. It is easy to get pay raises if you are committed to selling.
good,"Managed multiple tasks to include cash handling and customer service."
good,"I learned that I really enjoyed the creative part of the Fashion Part of the Dillard's Sales Job."
good,"Good environment, opportunity for advancement, health, dental, and vision insurance available along with 401K, routine work with seasonal store events for customers and employees, and employee discount available"
good,It is typical management with ok pay and the company can be very political at times. I have seen people be promoted who regularly slept on the job and come to work wreaking of alcohol! And have seen hard workers get fired. I was with company six years and have no regrets that I am not working for them anymore.
good,"There were goals to reach if you wanted to make the big money but they were not unattainable. I reached mine every week, even though I was a young, petite female and the work was pretty laborious. The management was nice and very understanding if you had to leave early or call in. The hardest part of the job was the heaviness of some of the boxes we had to load, but then again management had no problems with helping us lift them or getting someone to do so if they were not available. Co-workers were pretty nice. The most enjoyable part was PAY DAY! Even working part-time, I made about $350 a week if I reached my production goals (which, like I said, I did 99% of the time). I would definitely go back if I needed to."
good,Really good management.  Sometimes co-workers were not team players but for the most part everyone got along.
good,"Competitive Workplace, Cut throat induced through the management,"
good,"Everyday is stressful when you have a quote to meet and everyone fights for customers. I experienced a couple of times my co-workerd fight the customer asking them ""why are you purchasing items from her?"" and the customer be filled with rage and not be able to do anything because when you would tell management they would not do anything about it."
good,"I loved working for Dillard's ,the only down side was the returns ."
good,"I do say, that despite all the negativity and stress due to being on the sales floor, are the discounts and amazing fashion sense you learn. I, myself, had a great run with my sales here, however I had felt very discriminated against because I was the youngest one that was working there at the time. The floor manager's and sales supervisor's always had to stir trouble due to here-say."
good,Through my internship I learned about store management and how to plan events.
good,"The hardest part of the job is that it is very stressful due to the fact we each, as associates, have to make quota everyday. Other than that it can be enjoyable getting to meet new people everyday."
good,Retail is a tuff place to work. Super boss. Dealing with indivdual store manager could be taxing on the nerves.
good,"always busy, training employees and helping customers.  7 million dollar business, with no assistant. multi-tasking all the time."
good,Help Treated like a second class citizen. The threat of being terminated is always held over your head.
good,Sales environment engaging with customers to make their shopping experience comfortable and successful. 
good,"A typical day would be working the cashier, assisting several customers find exactly what they need, giving advice, and cleaning/straightening up clothes and desk area. The hardest part of a sales associate at Dillards is when managers give you projects to finish in a specific amount of time while also keeping up with multiple customers (especially when alone). The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the people and making them happy at the end of the shopping experience!"
good,"Dillards Travel was an offset for Dillards customers to be able to use with their accounts and also other customers. This was more leisure travel than corporate. Responsible for vacation packages, hotels, cruises and product knowledge of the companies that were our vendors."
good,"A typical day at work for me is maintaining my area of sales counters from directives given. making sure cases are fully stocked and setup correct. money in registers are counted to the balance given."
good,"fast paced, worked with great friends, worked long hours, learned patience, everyday was a different day"
good,"Spent the day assisting customers, ringing up sales, clearing out dressing rooms and stocking or straighting racks. Due to low volume, we would walk around the store and check out other departments. The management didn't seem involved much except to remind us to keep busy. The co-workers were all helpful and friendly."
good,"stock, clean, sales, events opened and closed the store the job was pretty easy"
good,Is competative work place since your sales was based on a quota. Its a good place to work and the are flexible with hours espically if you are in college. The staff is also friendly.
good,Pleasant place to work for a retail store. The corprate culture is good with a focus on the employees and making sure that they have all the tools they need to get the job done.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and helping them with their needs. I have learned to perform excellent customer service.
good,There are good and bad days Learned how to put up your table and clothes.Wasn't bother with any of the employee's but 3 older women.They where retired and happy to have a parttime.
good,"While taking a shower i would be going over all the things i would to do that day. Followed with a fast pace, big smile, and a friendly, warm, welcoming greet to each of my customers. I would start with my shock, seeing what was needed for the floor, and in the process giving service to the customers around me rather it be checking out, payments, returns, applying for a creditcard, or simply just needing an honest opinion. I've learned that the customers needs come first, that you are expected to give your best, and to have self-control in every situation. Out from my peers or for better words my co-workers my work spoke for itself. I have never had a problem with any of my managers nor supervisors in the past. If you take a look at my references you will see my managers listed. I work really fast, but organize, and very well put together. My parents raised me to respect those older and younger then myself; so for that, and the fact that i dont get into peoples business i never get into trouble nor situations with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was getting customers to apply for creditcards. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching the customers walk away with a smile on their face of satisfaction."
good,worked in Woman's department (plus sizes) and enjoyed the interaction with customers and employees.
good,I must say the amount of traffic in Dillard's is amazing. Depending on the inventory - we may have a good month or not. Furniture is controlled by corporate decisions.
good,It's a stylish place to work; The weekly pay is sweet for a retail job but it's not beneficial to the employee if the customers can't find a single deal (which is rarely offered.) especially if you're working for commission.
good,It was a great paying job that had the opportunity to make money off commission as well.  The employees were nice and the management was better than most.
good,Overall great environment to work in. Very happy associates. Hardest part of my job is dealing with the excess of hangers from the sales the day before.
good,The only thing that I believe is an unfair advantage if you're working in men's shoes. Most men already know what they like and do not waiver from that brand. It's also very hard to get them to apply for a credit card because their wife or themselves already have one.
good,"Good environment workplace for a temporary period. Pay is decent/good depending on the area you work in and your sales. I enjoy my coworkers, but careful, there is drama!"
good,"Good job, must be able to multitask. Must be able to work throughout the week and weekends are a must. Hours are early afternoon til 7-7:15. An hour lunch break is a plus. Amazing managers and great people."
good,"After speaking with people that worked in other locations it really all depends on what store you are working in and who your manager is at the time.    I would recommend having a good working relationship with your manager and to get along with your coworkers as much as you can because obviously you’re going to be spending a lot of time with them."
good,An alright place to work if you ate Starting out. Flexible hours and opportunities to advance. Goals are sometimes set high and can get very competence in the work place.
good,"slow paced"
good,"Most of my work experience has been management, but at Dillard, it was a whole new atmosphere. It was refreshing and I feel like I have learned so much in so little time. I actually really enjoy working there, but I believe I'm ready for bigger and better things"
good,It is ok just not what I want. I want some thing like target.  I thought it was going to be better. I just need to get some more  hours and find some thing better.
good,You're expected to dress up for every shift. You're given unrealistic sales quotas and whether you keep the job or they let you go depends on how well you hit that unrealistic sales quota. You'll be lucky to work and maintain a job in this company for more than 2 years. You'll have better luck at keeping a job with this company in a bigger city than a small town.
good,"Advancement seems possible, but is hard. However they pay very well compared to other retail stores. Be prepared to make your quota, otherwise you're gone."
good,"At Dillard's I started out in customer service and within a few months I was promoted to a counter manager position at one of the cosmetic counters. I loved the atmosphere of both departments, but I feel like I enjoyed customer service more. In both positions I was required to count registers for opening and closing. In customer service I would handle customer complaints and issues that could not be resolved on the sales floor. I would run errands for other departments and managers, as well as wrap gifts. Customer service representatives were also required to make change for the employees when they needed it for their registers. As a counter manager I do similar work throughout the day. I still wrap for the customers whenever possible, I make change for other counters, I still run errands when needed, The main differences are mainly the title. As a manager I am not able to do much more than I was able to as a customer service representative, and it is kind of discouraging that upper management would promote me and talk about all that I would be able to do and the experiences that I would have and then when I get there the main thing that had change was the location of where I worked in the store."
good,Absolutely loved working in the retail store. Managers were easy going and hands on. Helping people is a joy of mines so helping people be beautiful was everything and more to me.
good,Dillard's is a very compassionate company. They are very family oriented and are very understanding when you have a family emergency. There is always something to do so your days are full. You get to know you coworkers very well and some become as close as family. Your work life balance however can sometimes be a struggle especially as a manager. Overall great company to work for if you are looking to work in retail management
good,I had no issue working with Dillards. They were accommodating with scheduling and the employees/management did their jobs. The commute to and from work was never exciting because of the high volume area and general timing with city traffic.
good,The job is good but the schedule wasn't for me. it was a good environment and quick job to learn. I think there should ne more break time so people can get food and come back and eat.
good,"It is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. They will not pay you lower than $11/hr. They will work with you on your schedule. You get paid weekly. You get hour breaks. You are not constantly being watched. Good people. Way better than Macy's and Nordstrom. There are good parts to it. BUT- beware. You have a quota to meet and they do not play around. If you're not making your sales or credits, you'll probably be asked to leave. If you work in shoes, you better be on top of your game or you will get devoured. Management complains a lot and thinks getting a credit is easy, it's not. That being said, I enjoyed working there. I was able to have a life and was making good wages. But in the end, I couldn't keep up with the demands of management. It was so much more stressful than I ever expected. It's disappointing. They think they aren't doing well because it's something the employees are lacking, but in reality, the products are too expensive and people aren't interested. They'd be great if they changed their way of thinking."
good,I loved my job here as well but the management was to strict & would not release us at our scheduled time.Everytime a customer would complain & it wasn't true about the complaint me & my coworkers would get introuble for everything.
good,"Slowly customers come in to be waited on for Dillard's card payments, purchases, work with inventory merchandise .Organizing merchandise and pricing merchandise.I always enjoy working with my customers and helping them complete their purchases.I always learned ways to work with merchandise ."
good,It was actually fun learning about the differences of bedding and letting people know what kind of items they would need for their beds. Helping customers figure out what they are wanting and getting it for them . management was great. She was always there to help out when need be. Made great friends at the job and helped each other out. Hardest part was sometimes it was hard trying to finish a project and get to your sales goal.
good,"Dillard's is an excellent company to work for as long as you are competitive when it comes to sales and achieving sales goals.  Thankfully I am competitive in all areas of sales, so I enjoyed working there."
good,while working the shoe department making sure the guest got the right shoe for comfort at a great price also for clothing insure got the right clothes that fit
good,"A typical day at Dillard's for a sales associate would be putting out stock,  rearrange to the floor to promote certain brands, and extreme selling to reach daily quota. Being a sales associate consist of styling customers, doing markdowns and markups, and plenty of customer service."
good,"SALES, SALES, SALES! CREDIT, CREDIT, CREDIT! That's all they care about. It is an ok place to work and the sales and discounts are good sometimes. But like I said its all about sales and credit."
good,"benefits could be better"
good,I learned how to communicate with different types of people effectively.  I learned to find what they were looking for and help them find it.
good,"This is a great temporary place to work because they start out at 12 an hour, however , the way their system is set up, discourages employees working together as a team and pits them against each other. All corporate cares about are sales, not the employees. I was lucky to have nice managers. Terrible job security... you could lose your job instantly if you didn't make your 3 month quota, even if there weren't any customers in the store.  you did get a generous 25% off discount and there were special days when it went up to 45%"
good,"Management was very lacking, a lot of favoritism and unfair treatment. Good environment with fun and energetic coworkers. Discount products and free gifts for excellent service. Many coworker competitions and prizes."
good,"Working for this company teaches me how to think before I say something , My co workers are so great , we help each other do better , The hardest part about the job is trying to make my goal ."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but the pay is minimum wage and only part time hours.  No insurance available. The people were so much fun to work with including staff and clients."
good,"I enjoy my position as Wedding Registry Specialist.  Working with couples at the happiest time of their lives is very fulfilling.  Senior management of the store is extremely supportive and allow me to be creative and work the hours needed to get the job done properly.  "
good,"We were in a high theft area. The employees did the best they could, they were required to meet sales quota's."
good,"I worked as the stores Head Cashier."
good,"Dillard's is a fun place to work. Through out the day you are constantly interacting with other people and providing customer service. I have learned many basics skills from my time spent working here. When it comes to dealing with difficult questions, product knowledge, customer service, etc. I have learned it all. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a certain number of sales per hour making the job stressful. The mot enjoyable part of my job was constantly being around people and growing relationships with my wonderful co-workers."
good,Customer service oriented where main goal is making sales and making shopping easier for customers. This job required a lot of long hours of standing and organizing departments. Meeting new people was always a pleasure.
good,"It can be great working at Dillard's. But can also be stressful. We have a sales quota to maintain, and certain amounts of guests that you need to sign up for the Dillard's Credit Card. The break room is nice though, with couches and recliners available, or you can use one of the many table and chairs. My store manager knows me by name, and everytime he sees me, he calls me by it. I also love my Department Manager."
good,great place to work. I really like the place and the people there are very nice.
good,Selling shoes was great. I enjoyed working here but not commission.
good,Sales cashier i learned fhow to deal with money and customer service
good,"Co-workers were fun to work with. A day included selling men's fragrance and interacting with customers. Also, putting up stock that we received."
good,"greeting customers, was the best for me. Learned how to sale and be a personal shopper. Hardest part is trying to meet your sales for the day."
good,"Working at Dillards was nice, I loved seeing customers in and out of the store on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed working at Dillard’s because you truly got to come and have a relationship with your customers. Goals can sometimes be unrealistic but mostly manageable. If you don’t hit your goal repeatedly you’re out! The other departments can be a little sale sharkish . But not a bad experience
good,"Wonderful place to work in if you are not in sales. I was customer service management. My hours consisted of days. you are not told you have sick pay unless you actually request it when you are sick, which is kind of odd. Pay raises are given if you push for it."
good,work environment was nice. it was always really slow. there weren't enough customers. the prices were too high. we had reallly high goals to set. for the areas we were in
good,A typical day at work depends on the day. It could be busy or really slow. Management is okay and the workplace culture is normal. I enjoyed talking to different people every day that I worked.
good,It was not a bad place to work very competitive on the sales floor some great managers and some really bad ones meet some great people there all in alll
good,Dillard's is very competitive and is paid for performance.  I love my store manger and my coworkers.  We work hard and it retail so the hours are a little longer but I don't work on xmas or any other major holidays.
good,Last couple of years was stressful. Much of the time spent working in the Shoe dpt was not enjoyable. I didn't feel I was trained properly. Working for commission was a struggle.
good,"I enjoyed the work environment when it wasn't dead, unfortunately it was always dead (slow). The job is quota based but doesnt provide the traffic for it, if you work in the home department you're essentially screwed when it comes to making numbers - especially because the home department is tucked in the back where no one knows where it is. Although the job is painfully boring in most departments the management is great and the pay is great ($12 an hour for sales associates)."
good,"Straitening things before we open. "
good,Dillard's was a descent place to work.  A typical day was modest workload with friendly co-workers.  Management (at the time was employed) had lost touch with their employees.  Talent was leaving due to stress of multiple layoffs.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with their laying off.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly co-workers in a moderate sized city.
good,Dillard's is a good company to work for. I enjoyed the competitive atmosphere and hard-working co-workers. Pay was good and the hours were given if deemed necessary.
good,the starting pay is good. they work with your schedule and great discounts.  management can be hard to get a hold of but when you do find them they do their best to help. the customers at this department store can be very tiring
good,"It's a place where there's always something to do, and the pressure isn't too much to get it all done in a single day. There is lots of job security, but almost no chance for advancement in the company. There's an hour long lunch break and two 15-minute breaks throughout the day, which is excellent. It's physically grueling work, but worth it if you have the energy. The hours are only part time, but it's good for any college kid living at home."
good,"management was terrible, but employees were nice. nice products as well, nice long hour break. costmetics had good choices. never let you work overtime"
good,Very competitive work environment meeting specific goals each day is very critical and will effect your pay. Management needs a little work other then that it's not that awful.
good,"You have a quota every day on sales you make during the day. Some sales from certain departments did not get added to your quota. I learned if your sales do not meet you get laid off which is out of your control since the store was always empty and not many customers. There is no ""team work"" at this company. All co workers compete against each other and steal other co worker's customers to get the sale and it causes drama for the environment. Most enjoyable part of my job was doing fittings and picking out outfits for the fashion show for the children. I made over $1,000 in sales that day because of the sales for the outfits i picked were bought and pre orders I did."
good,The job itself is quite easy. We work as a team to get the materials out in a fast paced manner with accuracy. Working with a team can be frustrating because some people may not pull their weight as you do. I learned to communicate efficiently with others to express how I feel so we can have a better work environment.
good,"Dillard's Is An Awesome Establishment To Shop, To Work Is A Different Topic All Together, They Expect You To Reach These Outrageous Numbers In Sailing Everyday But My Store Doesn't Have Traffic So That's Rare If That Was Ever Met And If You Didn't Met The Numbers After A Few Months Your Fired."
good,"For a retail job, this place is great.  Awesome benefits with holidays"
good,"I was at the Buyer store, so good opportunity there, very organized and well managed store"
good,loved the job and being responaible for your hourly raises based on the volume of sales sold.
good,Good company to work for. I would like to move up but i don't like the management job that are available at Dillard's. Great  Manager. Some of my co workers are a little lazy but for the most part I loved my job. It's just time for a change. Thank you.
good,Goals are higher in Dillards compared to other retails but they will pay you better than other retails as well. Their discounts are easily one of the best feature. Also Dillards provides good insurance.
good,Dillard’s was amazing. I loved Dillard’s and it was great. I had personal stuff going on. My grandmother has passed away and it was very hard for me. I had to miss her funeral and her wake for this job because they did not allow me to be off and threatened my job and I could not understand that and I knew then it was bad environment.
good,Dillard’s offers much room for advancement but also requires employees to thrive in a high stress work environment. It’s a competitive sales floor where you are expected to perform against coworkers.
good,It's a good place to work I'm just seeking something new .. I been there five years now and I'm at the point I just wann a try something new an experience new things in life
good,Your experience is where your base pay comes from however it's very competitive Cutthroat type environment because everyone's trying to meet quotas and you're not paid commission you're only paid hourly.
good,i learned  a lot for skin care and makeup. a typical day was for us to invite customers into our counter and help them with there skin goals workplace was ok sometimes a lot of gossip but it was fun.
good,I love the avada line. I miss it so much. I moved away and that is the only reason I no longer work there. It is still a salon so you will always run into issues with co-workers. The manger changes pretty quickly there.
good,"Dillard's pays very well at every level but the expectations are high. The best part of the job is that, even in management, there is a decent work/life balance. The worst part is that as a selling business manager, you're expected to train and develop your staff while competing directly against them for sales to meet personal quotas. It's very hard to balance and causes too much friction. It's a flawed concept."
good,"I worked at Dillard's for 18 years I learned my skill to sell and manage. the store 960 is family management helped each other."
good,"I am a workaholic, so I normally love going into work. What I noticed about the change of mood working for Dillard's as a sales associate was that the hours were too long. I'm perfectly fine with working on weekends, but weekend hours or available days would be at least 8 or 9 hours of work for part-time in one day. A normal work day would be helping a customer find an outfit, clean up after people in the dressing rooms, and keeping up with my numbers. Quota is a huge thing with Dillard's. My department manager for juniors was very unorganized: schedules, her own tasks, constant ""crunch time."" Prior to juniors I worked for the kids department and the manager over there was always on top of his duties and making sure we were all well balanced, so I was able to tell the difference. Honestly the hardest part about working in clothing retail was just trying to not look tired. On a busy day, you are constantly running around cleaning after people, and running after your customers so no one takes your sales. The most enjoyable part was just being able to help customers and reorganizing. I really do love to organize and make things look pretty, so I actually enjoyed that."
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
good,"my work day was the same just about everyday it was the same routine everyday, opening and ending of the shifted."
good,Got to stay on top of your game to mate a good quote. Associates are verry nice and friendly. Will help.
good,Helping customers was my most enjoyable part of the day. My co-workers were young and less determind then I was and it made it difficult when management didnt deal with those issues.
good,It was a great job I had fun while working there and met a bunch of great people and helped me.become a.more people person I was very hands on and helped.everyone out.
good,Dillards is a very fast-paced environment that teaches people to meet customer demands. You have a personal sales goal you must achieve and it helps you strive for a department goal to drive sales for the entire store.
good,i just had the best experience working there. My manager was very understanding given that i was a college student then. She worked very well with my schedule.
good,Some days were better than others. Did not completely agree with some of management actions. Loved the position I held within the company and the hours and pay was perfect.
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. Because, you can only keep your job if you maintain sales goals even if the business is slow you still have to maintain the sales goals if you don't you will be terminated."
good,"Dillard's was a great experience that I will always remember and appreciate.  The job was competitive, but rewarding.  The managers are very laid back and easy to work with."
good,beauty advisor. great workplace and pay. very poor management. great pay. outrageous quota with not enough clientele. needed more classes. I had none.
good,"i worked her for almost a year and i loved it! the only downside was i asked to be part time and they scheduled me full time instead. i was a college student at the time and i still loved it. great pay, so fun!"
good,Everyone is nice and I am always treated with great respect. I was surprised that the hourly wage was so high and they give you a lot of tool to help you move up and be successful. My feet always hurt because of the shoes and I never have a steady schedule but they pay more than other department stores and they treat me better too! Awesome team environment!!!
good,"I love the cosmetics department of Dillards, Inc. All of the beauty consultants were passionate about his or her craft and loved working for this company."
good,"Co-workers are really nice, the hardest part of the job was making a ridiculous quota, I dint like when customer returns something and it counts against you."
good,"great atmosphere but the SPH which was designed to create friendly competition actually created a ""cut throat"" environment"
good,"Merchandised the whole department."
good,"Loved working there but if you get a pay cut and you're making under $10/hr, its automatic termination. My managers were very nice to me however the structure of the company leaves many employees stressed out. The company stresses how making your quota is very important.Another downside is that when a customer returns something you sold them it counts against you & you have to make that money up on top of your daily quota. If you want a short term job go for it but if you want a job with job security I would not recommend this company. The way that this company is setup results in letting a lot of good, hard working people go & creating even more tension in the workplace."
good,"I loved working at Dillard's as a sales associate. I was on time for every shift. I worked with all kinds of people, and that's where my excellent customer service skills kicked in. I assisted my customers with anything they needed. The customers turned into my cliental. I learned what my customers liked and disliked, which made their shopping experience fun and stress free. This is what my favorite part of the job for me. Making the customers happy from assisting them find what they came for. The management at Dillard's, to me, wasn't that great compared to my previous management I've been under. I can say that the manager over my department was pretty awesome and so were my co-workers. We all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job, in sales, is meeting the sales per hour (SPH). Since I'm great with working with people and listening to customers, I was able to sale more and always exceed my SPH."
good,"Work a Dillard's Kenwood for the company for a period of eight months, many interesting, I helped my skills as Customer service grew, but sales is not my thing. The company is Cincinnati Ohio"
good,"Dillards was a great environment to work. A typical day consisted on selling fragrances and cosmetic products.  I learned how competitive it can be to meet sales goals despite the saturation of sales associates in one department. Management was consistent. My co workers were great. Despite our efforts to meet our goals, we were very cordial and willing to help when needed. The hardest part about the job is meeting sales goals during the slow months. My most enjoyable part while working at the fragrance department, we were able to make win tester bottles from various reps based on the quantities sold."
good,"Great pay, being retail they don't offer set schedules unless you work in the office. They do try to work with you if you have other obligations such as school or a child. Employees work together to get a big project done and even go into other areas to assist."
good,"Excellent environment, I Felt comfortable with my employees and customers as well as my job positions. There's plenty of opportunities at Dillard's.Due to my hard work and skills I possessed, I was able to get promoted quickly."
good,"Good benefit, fast pace, Good retirement plan. I worked hard and sometimes stressful.  But it was a good job.  Sometimes you want ti be off but you had to work."
good,Its usually just waiting for customers to come call them and make a client tale. Management was really nice and co-workers very little rude sometimes nothing was really hard then standing for 8 hours and the reason I left the job because I had to move back to Pakistan for couple months. The most enjoyable part was customer service and learning how to do make up on different people
good,"My employer is a great company, they have a great benefits, my only problem I have my rates is to lower. I love my job I enjoy to work for them. Not everyone gets pay the same. I just don’t like the pay cut"
good,There was something different going on everyday. Never was a dull moment.
good,"The work culture was absolutely horrendous, and my manager was a gossip monster. She had her favorites and that was that - if you were not one of them, she would do everything in her power to make you miserable. Girls are not kind to each other when it comes to sales."
good,"the work on a daily basis were good fair time schedules, I learned how to work the system for customers, management was good to the employees, work place culture was great"
good,They hired me under false pretenses. I started at the end of June and have now found out they’re turning into a discount center which will not only cut our hours but they will be cutting the pay as well. They will also be letting go about 30 people.
good,"There were daily sales goal set and if missed enough times, the ability to move up, was impossible. The sales matrix also determined the ability to go from part-time to full-time."
good,I managed the fragrance and makeup departments. Dillard's was a fun place to work I enjoyed working and improving the customers appearances and self-esteem.
good,"Extremely competitive, cut throat, sales goal driven. The previous store manager was amazing but the manager was horrible, partial to specific cultures, and was not above sneaky endeavors. She had me sign three write ups before firing me, even though I had documentation and had my shifts covered due to extenuating circumstances including my child being in the hospital. Will never work a sales job again after this one."
good,it was good until i sold something to myslef and they fired me.ll admit I bought shoes from myself but the next day i returned it. So it's not like it went n my quota. Not to mention that my manger said that I could but them from myself so I feel like I was cheated out my job on that one.
good,"The pay is good, and the vacation and discounts are worth the stress of having to sale and open credit applications if you think it is worth it. not all managers work with schedule."
good,Dillard's need to come to terms that times have changed and customer want help but not the same help like times in the past. Most customers today what to shop the whole store and just one department and raises where base on sales. This cause issues in the depaments and with other co-works to fight on the floor
good,"We would make regular rounds to all of the stores in the KC Metro area, as well as the locations at the mall in Topeka, KS."
good,I usually worked alone
good,I think it’s a great  department store very expensive but the experience I had with the manager was unheard of  the thing he said to me was very unprofessional even his assistant called him an SOB under his breath
good,"I came in to move up to management after a year. I made Dillards $300,000 in sales in ladies shoes my 1st year and 3 years after: 3 Pacesetter Awards. Needless to say i never got offered a management position. I had 6 years of restaurant managing before hired at Dillards."
good,"A fun job but very cut throat w sales. A big turn around rate, if you miss your sales goal one time they will let you go (I've seen it done twice). A good environment as long as the sales associates aren't mad at you for ""stealing their sales"""
good,"Overall a good Company to work for it is a sales per hour store, so you had to hustle and that creates hostilities among co-workers the most enjoyable is selling,because u maintain your sales per hour. We had employee appreciation days and we get free lunch"
good,"A typical day at work, I would clock in go to the morning meeting in front of the escalator listen to the managers pick on each person except for the ones who opened the most store credit cards. Then proceed to  count each register because sometimes only one person is there to open three areas,check fitting rooms from last nights shift to make sure there is no merchandise left for customers to take. Put away any shipment brought out by the receiving dock, then if theres markdowns proceed to execute them. Take care of the customers. Co-workers were very friendly, except for those who have problems with each other. The hardest part of the job is getting the customers who don't want to open a store credit to do so. If you don't open any credits the managers would come on the floor and speak with you and then point you out in the morning meeting.""EMBARRISING""! The managers don't care what shift you tell them you could work, they'll give you whatever schedule they want! The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the nice customers in their children and the store events that they would have from time to time. Training the new sale associates, their like little puppies. Store moves was the best time wasting experience I ever had. I miss working there, I would recommend this job only if you could deal with some not so nice managers who think that their GOD!"
good,"pleasant working environment for the most part, flexible hours. schedule went out monthly. you were able to take your birthday off paid, unless you were born November-January( you get to choose what day off for birthday pay outside of Holiday months)"
good,Fun for a short period. Also great for experience and seasonal openings. Best for college or school students with flexible hours. very open to shifts of choice
good,They really thought they could talk to their employees any kind of way. I didn’t like how they honestly operated the store . Everybody was like in a rush to do things.
good,"Too few customers, not able to meet sales quotas. Fast paced work environment. Really enjoyed employee discounts. Management needs to improve in order to make this a more enjoyable place to work."
good,"Good products - nice experience - nice associates - officious management - a good metaphor would be ""one rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel"" and he did."
good,"this is a slow paced job with a lot of opportunities. however you must meet sales to gain these opportunities . be careful of what department you chose, because it will determine your sales rate."
good,"just a part time job. its nice and slow, nothing too hectic. the hours are good. just wish they would hire for full time and also offer growth. its ok though"
good,"Store I was in had horrible manager who after 2 years did not even know regular long time employee names.  40+ hours a week, sometimes 6 days a week and only had 1 weekend off a month...sometimes not even that."
good,Will over work you with unobtainable quotas. Credit apps are a must have 1 for every 40 hours worked. You can be laid off for not reaching this goal or sales quotas
good,"My biggest problem was getting my schedule once I was not at the store. For a company as big as Dillards there should be some sort of online employee portal for scheduling and pay information. The only was is to go to the store and print out a stub, or ask someone to see what your schedule is."
good,A company that you work a lot and don't get appreciate it....no raise in 11 years. Environment very stressfull.  No way to grow in there. They expect me to train new people when I am just an associate
good,"Dillards is a fun company to work in. But if you are not good at selling you will be fired no matter what your first three months . The daily quotas were very high and hard to accomplish since it is a high end store not a lot of people shop there since it very expensive , which makes it hard for the associates to accomplish their daily goals. It is very easy to get behind on your quotas."
good,If you don't mind dressing up in a suit and standing for long hours it's a good place to work as a sales associate. Management was nice. Highly competitive! Issues with other employees trying to steal your sales. Decent incentives for meeting goals and special incentives from time to time.
good,This was one of my worst jobs. Poor management in my opinion. The manager has the ability to change your time with out you knowing. This was the only job that at the end of the month I owed them money for not reaching the unrealistic quota numbers.
good,"Evidently my review contained inappropriate comments, but try as I might, I couldn't eliminate whatever it was that was objectionable.  It's just not a nice place to work."
good,"It's a beast.. It will eat you alive if you can't handle more than 50 calls per day, 75-125 during holidays. 1 out of every 4 customer is going to yell at you and 1 out of 3 of those will cuss and fuss. That being said, the people that work there are good people, they will have your back as long as you leave very informative notes. The people in tho\e office are always sharing recipes, and sharing home made food, if you are there for over a year they become family. Management though. it depends on the person, some are WAY sweet and helpful. Others cold shoulder you and leave you in the cold."
good,"I had a great manager and she got transferred to the PV mall and a idiot took over and didn't know how to do anything. I would be scheduled to come in at 9am and the manager came in at 8am and make changes to have me come in at 12pm, and doesn't call or text me, i show up at 9am and he looked at me like im stupid, theres know way to be automatically notified when there is a change to your schedule.   I loved my job overall, the manager was gone(finally) but they wouldnt give me full time, i would have stayed but i needed full time"
good,Retail sales for full time employees is difficult.  The sales goals are somewhat unrealistic and if they are  not met you are terminated within 6 months.
good,I have been with Dillards for  6 years. In those six years I have loved ever minute of my job. I have two young children that just simply need more of my time and Dillards hours and demands are simply too much and they take me away from my children.
good,It was an okay job the people in the departments are really rode. Probably because they have more experience than the new people I don't know. But they aren't helpful or friendly.
good,We were constantly being reminded of sales goals from a previous year. If you weren't able to meet those goals would determine whether you kept your job or not
good,"For retail, Dillards is a great place to work. Work/Life balance depends on your position with the company. Benefits don't start until 3 months and 401k until 1 yr. Job security/culture depend on the manager at the time."
good,"must keep up with Sales per hour or draw if not you will get fired. They use very old Point of sale systems. Management can be unfair at times, don't communicate with associates. Co workers were older women who gossip a lot. Best part of the job was interacting with co workers and customers."
good,It's a job plain in simple they work you from time in to clock out but want you to work at a full time effort but you are part-time and when you max out at pay you are done. But they will give you you more responsibilities but no more money.
good,"Retail is a funny job, some customers have no respect for you and think you are a failure at a ""real world"" job while others appreciate the service that you give to them during their shopping experience.  It is a unique climate with a customer base that ranges in a wide variety of classes.  I have fun with the job and am friendly with all of my co-workers.  I try to have fun with the client and help them relax during their shopping experience."
good,"typical work day very long, slow business, co-workers very caddy, required to meet high sales per hour and business is very slow during week, for the most part the pay is good and friendly customers, good quality merchandise, generous employee discount"
good,"Dillard's likes to proclaim its a family owned business, but at the end of the day its a corporate machine. Employees are forced to meet unrealistic quota's for sales daily, and if they don't meet them, their pay is reduced. This breeds unnecessary competition between employees and creates a very stressful work environment. Management also makes promises they never come through on, and micromanage to an extent that the way things worked changed multiple times daily."
good,"Was challenging, working for this company brings out the competitiveness in everyone.  One area they need to be work on is treating the employees better than they do. Employees will work even harder if they are appreciated and recognized instead of making them feel like they are disposable."
good,"Typical day at work, adhering to customers needs and wants in clothing. Management not too enthusiastic. Co-workers very greedy, always after your sales. Hardest part, meeting monthly sales goals."
good,keeping up with clients and money.Keeping up with your quota.
good,I was a full-time employee in the home department of the store. I was a cashier and a stovker of the store product. I would also have to sale store product by a certain percentage every three months or my pay would go down.
good,"Face Pace work place mon-sunday, I enjoy Dressing up in aSuit and tie everyday it really make me feel important in the working world. Ive learned how to be very professinal and how to use correct grammar daily. I love my co-workers we uplift eachother everyday to help one another meet our daily sales quota. The hardest part of the job will have to be the management."
good,Enjoyed results of produced Displays
good,"Overall not a terrible place to work. The management was nice enough, however the upper management only cares about the upper management. I had previously been a retail manager before working at Dillard's and I learned a different point of view from the retail industry. I learned a lot about the shoe industry, which is pretty irrelevant to what I'm going to school for and the career I want to begin eventually. The co-workers where all very nice and for the most part everyone got along with everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free shoes and free lunches from several different reps. The most enjoyable part of the actual job was the customer interaction and every work day differing from the previous."
good,"I met all types of people, Had fun doing make up on people I work with a great group of women"
good,"the enviroment is very sales oriented so i can be a little cut throat, it is difficult to move up with the company frome an associates postion, "
good,Personally l think the manager of Ladies Dept should have clean and groomed nails and represent her Dept and if she can’t even do that why would she expect so much from her sales staff? It’s difficult to work under a manager that is threatened by and intimidated by your presense.
good,Management was extremely unprofessional and would yell and belittle you in front of other co workers and staff. They made a great job unbearable . Especially that Ruth. She is one of the worst managers I have ever worked for and she should be ashamed of how she treated her employees.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. If necessary I probably would go back! The store managers are horrible but you don’t deal with them everyday. Your immediate managers are the ones who make it or break it for you. I had an amazing manager that i was so sad to leave her. She made me love my job. The sales quota is high if you let it get to that point. You can manipulate your quota which most people don’t know. If you let the employees get into your head you will never make it in the job. Hostile employees due to the quota but if you stay in your lane and hold your head up and not let them get to you you’ll be great. Employees stay there for years! Generous pay too.
good,"The shoe department consists of selling, stocking, keeping the floor neat and clean as well as inventory, I learned a different kind of structure not having worked for a corporation before. I also learned many people don't work well in the structured environment. Its fun to work with a large group of people to meet different people from different backgrounds."
good,"Sale goals, sale goals, sale goals "
good,"I wish management was more active and collaborative with all employees. Working in cosmetics with a great work ethic and true passion for artistry/ making people feel their best did not really cut it for Dillards management. They are very STRICT on making numbers and selling selling selling. Sadly, I was with the company for nearly 2 years and have gone through 3-4  store managers which never cared to reach out to employees and offer further training/assistance to help grow our knowledge and make better sales."
good,Not the best company to work for. Too cut-throat. Management staff is no very supportive and when you ask for help they don't properly coach you. The company pays well.
good,"You had a ""ranking"" which was based on how many sales you made per day. If you don't make many sales, when it comes time for a raise, you may get a pay cut if you do not make enough sales. You work with others who are competing to meet the numbers that management provides no matter how unrealistic due to few customers. It makes weekends hectic when there are more employees working and everyone is trying to snag as many sales as they can. I just worked at my own pace and focused on good customer service and providing customers with what they needed."
good,"We would sometimes only have 1 customer a day.  Cosmetic customers are now mostly ordering online.  "
good,"The pay is very low for the quota we make everyday. A lot of cleaning to do during Christmas, some of the managers are super rude and won't work with your school schedule."
good,working with different aspects of the public. Dealing daily with clients on their beauty needs and fun associates to work with. The store would always offer deep discounts to its associates.
good,"There are daily goals that need to be meet, Those goals are usually pretty hard to meet because they are money based, and your co workers are also looking to take your sale."
good,They pay well and offer great discounts to employees but need more structured management systems. Most stores have outdated fixtures and outdated management styles.
good,Dillard's is a great place to work. The people are very friendly and the pay is very good. Dillard's has helped build my sales experience and knowledge while teaching me new ways to provide the absolute best customer service possible.
good,Dillards as a Company is a great place to shop for quality brand names. I was able to obtain quite a bit of positive knowledge from this company. It contributed to a better position after almost 10 years of service. The hardest part of this job was having to cope with upper management staff being sometimes unable to separate personal views from business and actual job performance. There are times where a company as a whole is condemned for events brought on by store level management. I will have to be fair. Other than that I loved every bit of my time there.
good,"Dock worker/Support Associate. Since ""Obamacare"" getting full time is pretty much impossible unless you want to go to sales floor and not have a job for long..."
good,"It is a better place to work than other retails. "
good,I love having ladies come in looking and feeling one way and having them feel another before they leave. I love seeing them smile and loving themselves a little more. The knowledge I know about the products gave me even more confidence in giving the product to the customer.
good,This position was a part-time position when I was in college.  It served it's purpose. I gain knowlege and it help me develop and prefect my customer service skills.
good,If you don't meet the required sales in a three month period your wages will be reduced. This makes the work place very unfriendly because everyone is trying to make their goals at any cost
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking the stock room and taking care of customers, while taking care of the sale going on at the time. I learned good time management skills and knowledge of my product. The management was very good and was organized. My co-workers were good but not very helpful when it came to the sales floor. The hardest part of the job was keeping the sale going on organized. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers."
good,"Job is fun and helps you learn what it is like to work under pressure when you have to meet sales quota every day, very competitive. Job security though is not there."
good,You have to very agresive selling items and making sure you reach your quotes daily and weekly... You can't be nice to certain ppl because they would steal your sells and then you are in the hole so yeah.... It's very agresive
good,"A typical day at work for Dillard's would be providing guests with and pleasant and enjoyable shoppin experience, assisting guests with the proper attire for various occasions, locating specific items within store, keeping guests imformed of upcoming events, placing special orders for guests upon requet, cashiering, creating attractive menniquinns that produces increase in sales, create special events that promote stare visit thereby increasing revenues, etc."
good,I learned that you can stick with thing longer than you should and get far
good,"Helping customer, showing and telling customer about new merchandise"
good,"Here my job was to help people find cosmetics and perfume/ cologne."
good,"Upon clock in, set up register and counter. The department manager was very diligent and strong when it came to running the department, very enjoyable to work for. Head management and Asst. Management were never on the same accord and made work a harder task than what it had to be. The co-workers were amazing to be around and very easy to work with in the department."
good,"Met and exceeded my sales goal (SPH)set by Dillards. Assist customers with their shopping needs. Unpacked and set up merchandise during shipments. Scanned for markdowns, tagged and merchandised as needed. Was involved in inventory and attended multiple seminars to better my education for the products."
good,"My department manager was great! Probably the most realistic minded person in the store. Unfortunately, his bosses were not so realistic. Daily work consisted of unpacking product and making room to display it. My co-workers were charming old ladies, who would regale me with tales of years passed."
good,"* Helping guests and organizing all of the Michael kors handbags and wallets."
good,"I loved the people I worked with.  My manager was great. Pay was good at the time, I was younger without kids so it fits for that time. Worked around my schedule."
good,"I worked at Dillard’s for almost 5 years. Every store is different, every manager is different, & every department is different, so people’s experiences at Dillard’s vary a LOT. They pay very well, & there are lots of benefits (vacation PTO). If you work hard, there are lots of opportunities to advance within the company, but FYI, managers will work a lot even on days off. Corporate tends to bully store managers, causing those store managers to bully department managers & associates."
good,"The pay is good, but you have a quota that you have to meet daily.  You have to get atleast 2 dillards credit cards daily or you can get in trouble. It will keep stacking up until you have made it all."
good,"The people you work with could make or break your experience. There is always something that needs to be done and majority of everyone will chip in to help when its not busy. Getting paid weekly was nice. "
good,Selling to meet hourly sales goals. Move fast to provide customer service and move on to work with several customers at a time. Meet and great every customer quickly always looking for a customer to complain.
good,It was a decent job. Goals and quotas are set very high and employees can be terminated very quickly because of it. Makes it a very competitive atmosphere.
good,I really enjoyed my time here working part-time during college. The pay was good ($11-15) but it depends a lot on your selling skills. People who have been working there for a long time will eat you alive if you don't stand your ground.
good,"-You were expected to continuously open dillard's credit cards which offered very little rewards for customers"
good,"Dillard's is a good place to work if you like competition. But, the competition is sometimes too much. They have unrealistic expectations of employees regarding amount of mandatory sales. There is no job security at all. The department managers are amazing at leading their departments. The store management needs a little bit of change."
good,This is my first experience in working in the retail world and it has been an eye opener.  I don’t like the extended holiday hours and not allowed to take anytime off during the holiday. You get Thanksgiving day and Christmas Day off-no time to spend with family with one day off but that’s retail-not for everyone.
good,Communication among different levels of employees could be better. Sales goals are realistic sometimes but at others they are impossible. Credit Applicant quotas are impossible to meet.
good,Dillard's was a workplace where I enjoyed helping people and putting a smile on their face. I also tried to make shopping easier for them by locating specific merchandise. It also had the opportunity to voice my opinion
good,"My experience with Dillards was mixed.  My coworkers and immediate management were great but upper management seemed confused."
good,very stressful and fast pasted. overall it is a good environment to work in. Everyone works as a team and willing to help out wherever is needed. most employees are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.
good,"A trade of anywhere from running credit card applications to sizing individuals for shirts and suits. Excellent customer service is expected, and a clean neat appearance along with an repetitive attitude is essential."
good,"I learn so much from my management here , you have huge opportunities here if you planning on staying in retail. Very easy job if you do what you supposed to do. High goals to achieve and maintain your pay."
good,"Enjoyed interacting with people. It was fun and fast pace."
good,I honestly enjoyed working at Dillard's. I cannot say anything negative about my experience at Dillards. I had the greatest manager at Dillard's. The primary reason I left was to get a full-time job at Deluxe Checking company.
good,Manger at my store was horrible. My department manager left and she was a good manager. Your co-workers can be your best friend or your worst enemy depending on if you are in the same department. People steal each others sales often.
good,It was a good experience. Great pay and benefits. Good opportunity to learn to community and work with others. Very flexible with my school schedule.The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with your sales.
good,"Great team. A lot of responsibility, but a great Salon Division support team."
good,"Days working at Dillard's can be stressful because everyone has to meet a sales quota. This often cause arguments between associates on the floor, sometimes in front customers. However, if you know how to sale and handle customers you will be fine."
good,"Upper Management changes are frequent which makes it harder for one to prove themselves.  You are constantly starting over.  You need to be organized and devoted to team development, recruiting and out sourcing."
good,"the job responsibilities were fine but the compensation was not very good. did not have very good benefits. treated everyone the same, no special consideration for being a manager versus non management."
good,"unloading trucks and restocking shelves "
good,Pay is good.  High Demands from Corporate.  No work life balance.  If you are willing to work hard and are a self learner promotions can happen fast.  Employees are held accountable for their job responsibilities.  Dillard's has been good to me.
good,Working at Dillard's at La Plaza Mall was a good stepping stone to get my feet wet for working in retail. It is easy to learn the routine for the job assigned.
good,"I enjoyed this job, because for one the pay was great. The job was fun. I was able to interact with various characters and introduce them to the products that the company offered. I learned that a customer does not always have to be seen as a money making instrument, but a friend. I was able to build strong relationship skills with my customers, not by only meeting the quota, but wanting the best for them. However, that was the hardest part of my job. Meeting my quota everyday. There were days where there was just no customers, no money to spend. Our prices seemed to be too high. It was difficult to makes sales, but the most enjoyable part was leaving work with a victory, after it all seemed contrary."
good,"Provided guest with one of a kind sales experience by knowing product knowledge  and competition. Kept a clean and inviting area. Counted all monies before and after a shift. Made top sales in department by earning gratuitouses. Also, put together displays to keep the store with an inviting appeal."
good,"the place is ok, some people are nice but advancment is nil, they keep you part time and trying to get to full is a joke. "
good,"I've already done this part. No health insurance for part-time employees. I have nothing more to say. For the most part some of the managers are understanding.... but the store manager at the time was just rude, unprofessional with customers, and employee's."
good,"You have quotas you have to meet or you'll get fired. However, the pay is good and the discount too. It is a good part time job."
good,"This job was a great way to start a career path. The compensation was good. The base pay was good, there were incentives to get a higher pay. The atmosphere was good, as well as easy to get along with people to work with."
good,"The most of enjoyable of the job is to help customers and rewards if you worked hard to meet their quotas to get raised  each time of evaluation.  To some people the hardest part of the job was to meet their quotas but to me if you worked hard you meet over their quotas.  From the time I started to work to finish.  I Worked hard to help customers, got along with co-workers and managers."
good,Could have been better. The management all act like the employees are scum. All though this is only accurate for about half the management staff.
good,"Some days shopping was slow. We used that time to arrange clothed and complete mark downs,"
good,"Dillard's was good with their hours being stable and paid fairly. I have to say, their management in my store was not my favorite. It seems to me a lot of managers get lucky to have their job positions. Most of the time they don't seem nearly as competent as they should be."
good,"I have noticed that if you are good at the job you do you can not get promoted to better pay and more hours,"
good,Good starting pay. Commission is hard to make sometimes. Monthly quotas are kinda tough on slow months. Co-workers are typically sharks.
good,"My most favor part about this job was getting to know a customer making sure they were taken care, showing them that we were always there as a team to help them find the items that they wanted and giving them a pleasant experience at Dillard's. The hardest part was dealing with poor management and they showed a lot of favoritism. Overall very unprofessional!"
good,"A typical day at Dillard's  was very laid back through the week, and  busy on the weekends. I really liked getting paid weekly. I got along really well with my co-workers."
good,the job was ease but hardest part was standing long hours and the trip to the break room was to long takes up half of break time.  my team members was enjoyable.
good,"I love working with customers and helping them find exactly what they are looking for. It's a great feeling when you have a satisfied happy customer. Sales quotas are impossible to meet in most areas of the store which is how you get your raises, and by getting people to open a Dillard's card! Management (from corporate, which trickles down) only cares about the sales numbers. They do not take into account how hard you work doing markdowns, unpacking freight, merchandising, cleaning...etc. if your numbers aren't good enough even if you are a really hard worker in all of those other areas, you will be fired. I've watched it happen. Corporate management looks at numbers and decides who gets fired. This is decided when they have never met the person nor do they know about their other strengths they bring to the company. Frustrating. I've been there a year and a half with no raise, yet I train new people and because of my experience, newer employees seek me out for assistance with problems and questions. I'm always more than happy to help them and I enjoy training others but it would be nice to be recognized for doing so. One big point for me is Dillard's flexibility with scheduling and time off for part timers. I travel quite a bit and they have always been great about giving me what I need off. I know a lot of places wouldn't do that. Overall, it's not the best job I've had but certainly not the worst either. I just keep trying to do the best I can and that's all I can do."
good,"Dillard's is a great retail place, but the management needed some guidance in helping their staff.  It was most satisfying in dealing with people of all races and diversity.  Most enjoyable was assisting any young man who did not have any clue as how to dress for an important evening out."
good,"Working in the executive office was an exciting learning experience.  Handling all time errors prior to closing payroll, answering associates questions concerning time available, requests for name tags and business cards and handling customer service issues.  Hardest part of the job was handling 200 employees' questions while getting my actual jobs done.  I took care of reviewing applications, setting up interviews, running background checks and bringing in for new hire class.  Coordinate with managers regarding time errors, interviews, reviews, etc.  Also maintained credit card statements for executives corporate cards, keeping receipts and emailing all relevant information to corporate office.  Most enjoyable part of the job was keeping everything moving forward."
good,i really love working at dillards. very competitive environment so be reaady to battle. results based job so get your SPH up.
good,"Strong retail sales experience. Manager for six weeks while manager went on maternity leave.  Responsibilities included daily sales goal maintenance, monthly training sessions via internet, Up Sell or Add-on techniques, stocked shelves and arranged new shoe displays, telemarketing current clients about upcoming events and sales, one new credit card obligation per week, and excellent customer service skills."
good,I have been with Dillard's almost 3 years.  I worked in the Monroe store for 2 of those years and had good success.  I am now at the Shreveport store.  I have had many accomplishment will at this store.  The Bedding Department has improved greatly over the last year as the customer have repeatedly complemented.  The sore manager is always patting me on the back for a job well done.  However we are moving back to the Monroe area for good.
good,I enjoyed being on a positive team of women and working daily with people. Goals were made and expected to be met.
good,"Good place to work, coworkers were good.Management were good,Ienjoyed working over there but policies are not good."
good,Typical day of work includes throwing freight and stocking to production floor.
good,"A typical day at work was loving to work with customers and help them find what they needed. I would always find something to do to keep busy. Learned to maintain a calm attitude under duress and cope with the situation in a professional fashion. Management was fun until visits from their bosses, where my managers would get nervous instead of remaining calm believing that they have done the right thing the first time. My co-workers were very much involved in sales as I was and my management team were in depth with doing the job with the utmost respect. The hardest part of the job, was having to bring the merchandise to the floor from the dock area at the same time that I was setting it up on display. For the most part, my overall job was enjoyable. With having love for people and being that people person, what more can you ask for?"
good,"Fun place to work and meet people. I was very busy most of the time. As a manager I learn how to do payroll a new way, how to make out schedules for a month at a time. I unloaded trucks and helped my employees keep the store clean and neat. I took inventory to the floor I helped out in all areas of the store if needed. I enjoyed all aspects of my job there. I got along with everyone. I enjoy meeting and greeting people which I think was the most fun about the job. The associates that worked there were pretty much all hard working and fun to be around."
good,"I worked in the Dillards store, but the fine jewelry department was rented by an outside company. We were told to put down Dillards as the place of employment, even though they did not pay us. The company has since went bankrupt and I don't know what happened to them."
good,"competitive sales floor(sales per hour),salary may flucutate,flexible work schedule"
good,"It is a good complany to work for, the hours arent the best. The pay is good. My favorite part about the job with being around people . The management is not the best. Not the best work ethics."
good,It was easy to learn and catch on to the business but mainly about work and only personal with co workers not management. It was a good experience and it gave me a respect and appreciation for retail workers
good,"Aggressive sales culture. Quotas are challenging to meet. Other associates, including department manager, stand behind register to ring sales making it difficult to jump in and get sales. Personalities on the sales floor can be challenging."
good,It's hard to have a consistent work life balance and black out no vacation nov-jan 1.  Paid holidays were a bonus performance pay not hrly. So very competitive.
good,"Good seasonal job, competitive and fast passed. Able to use creativity with merchandising that is all up to you to complete. No room for advancement but ok job. It was nice the time I was there."
good,"though this was a stressful job with competitive peers ,competitive pay i stil was able to meet nee people every day and serve customers as best i could. the challenge was to sale the product."
good,"Dillard's is a good company to work for with great discounts. They rate your sales goal too high for this area which makes it very hard to accomplish. Dillard's will train you for different departments. Tehya llow you to make decisions when making displays, etc."
good,"Sales goals are really high impossible to meet the goals but they pay you good if you meet your goals otherwise you get a pay cut after one year but the management is awesome they work with your schedule and good environment to work for , sales goals are little stressing"
good,"Provided information of merchandise to better perform on sales floor.  Hours were inconsistent however, some managers were kind and flexible as long as there was early notification."
good,"If you like working in the retail business Dillard's is a great option. Very nice products to sell and promote. Although very competitive to get a full time position, Every sales associate has to meet sales per hour given on a daily basis which is fine if customers are in the store to purchase."
good,Very little notice to employee overachievement or rewarding efforts. Management is abusive to their power; taking extra breaks and leisurely treatment
good,"As Dock Manager the job was enjoyable and schedule was set, but advancement opportunity was lacking typical for a retail job.  Senior management looks for people they can manipulate and sometimes these are the ones promoted to general store managers, operation managers, and/or retail managers."
good,Es muy buena paga pero bajo mucha presion por mas que di todo mi esfuerzo no lo vieron
good,"Great place to work as long as you don't mind the schedule which is made a month ahead of time, and don't let the attitude of other employees get you down. Most employees have such a negative attitude about the job and it can make you question if you like it or not but it is a great job for how much you get paid and the experience you gain."
good,"slow pace although I learned a lot about housewares and the difference between better cookware and even in the better crystal. the work culture was difficult sometimes, having to meet sales quota this would push staff to be competitive which would make a coworker upset if she or he believe you stole their customer."
good,"Dillard's is a great company to work for. It is usually a calm work environment, although it can get really busy. The management is excellent and really try to make their employees succeed. The hardest part of the job is how competitive it can get."
good,"I learned to use a scanner, and a company computer at checkout.  I learned good customer service skills.  "
good,It was a good job that was slightly physically demanding. I worked in the children's shoes department so it was never a dull day. I rarely saw my manager so I just managed myself and made sure my tasks were done before I left  for the day.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Great pay, benefits and even received a lot of items for free but lack a good management at the time I worked for Dillards. Stressful and sales goals were too high for a world that revolves around internet sales now-a-days."
good,Dillards is a good place to work for if you don't mind unreasonable sales goals. The fear of being fired was always a fear for me but i survived for 4 years.
good,"Dillard's in a great job to have while attending college. They don't pay enough to be considered as a career. The management is decent, but they do have their favorites."
good,"I enjoyed my employment at dillards no complaints j"
good,I decided to work there.put in an application and got the job .I sold mens clothes and I was the top credit app person in the store.I really enjoyed the people and the culture there.
good,"Dillards is a company where customer care is very important.  As a sale representative you need to stay in your department at all times so if you have a customer that feels comfortable with you and desire to do more shopping around the store you can not help him/her. This is also for foreign customers. Being able to speak more than 3 languages I understand that customers feel more at ease when the sales representative speaks same language. It is a way to give great customer care and make sure that the customer will come back."
good,"as a call center operator the job can be hard just like any customer crevice jobs, the environment is well serviced and maintained."
good,"Sales goals aren't manageable most months.  "
good,Loved this job but I had a small son who was only with his father every other weekend and management would not work with the hours that I could work even though they agreed to the schedule when I was hired.
good,the typical day was very stressful environment but other then that I learned a lot from working at dillards. I learned good customer service skills I learned a lot about different fragrance's and whats in them and how they were created. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay focused on your job with all the drama between the mangers and employees but I magerd to just stay to myself and do my job . The best part about going to work was interacting with my amazing client's making there day amazing getting them exactly what they came in for plus some .
good,"The job paid very well for an entry level job but lacked good management, which caused the job to be stressful. If you can stay focused on your job and not on the drama in the store you will enjoy working at Dillard's."
good,Always offering assistance if necessary.  Great organization between managers.  Team work was always encouraged and enjoyed.  Repeat customers because of how they were treated and the professionalism of the store.
good,You are given quotas daily and they must be met or your numbers decline and if by a certain time you are not where you need to be they can fire you or depending on your workmanship keep you and you'll be moved to a different department.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard's, made many friends. A tough place to advance unless you ""know somebody"". A lot of pressure to meet company goals and quota's."
good,"The hardest part of my position at Dillard's would clearly be that "
good,"normal pace, level headed co workers, same work different flow daily management  was decent could've been better there is no hard part about it very simple tasks to complete"
good,"My overall experience with Dillard's was positive for nearly six years. I worked with some awesome people, in a fun atmosphere and the Dillard's name stands for luxury and great quality.  I just didn't care for the often unattainable sales goals.  They have a specific dollar amount you are supposed to sell per hour.  Often time the goals are ridiculously high and that affects ones ability to advance or earn raises, unfairly in my opinion."
good,"I loved working at Dillards however, the store manager was very insecure and was worried that the CEO took an interest in me.  I just wanted to work in cosmetics.  I had no desire to do anything else and still don't.  I like engaging with customers.  The store manager and the assistant store manager were too petty."
good,"easy job as long as you were good with people, got to work with several people from different countries, very diverse."
good,"Greeting customers in a friendly manner."
good,Job was a good fit for me while attending school. Pay raises were a bit difficult to get as the goals were impossible at times to meet if you didn't have access to sell items in certain departments; and senior salespeople who were just awful made sure that did not happen.
good,Dillard's has a high expectation of sales numbers and amounts each day.  The Dock work required proper display and maintenance of store goods and materials along with merchandise.  The Dock requires all members to work as a team and cooperate for successful daily job completion.
good,Great atmosphere to work. Easy going and laid back. Very informative and dedicated to the customer. Co-workers are like family.
good,"To see everybody busy with there job."
good,it is a good place to start out in and the opportunity to advance is there but hard to reach at times and it is all based on numbers which go up and down day to day
good,"over all nice place to work, a lot of goals to make, friendly place to work, management was always there to listen and help out with problems and work around other jobs."
good,"A day began with a morning meeting. This meeting included top performers in the previous days. I was surely mention 2-3 per week. I learned how to have people skills and exceptional customer service. I dealt with handling cash every day, so this enhanced my exchange of monetary funds. My co-workers were supportive and creative. The most challenging part of the job was merchandising after high volume of customer activity. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting returning customers and speaking about the sale transaction, and how life has been for them."
good,"go to work clock in, and try to sell woman's shoes, not many people come unless there is a sale and then when there is a sale you need to watch for thieves because people steal a lot here. and since its commission based every worker is fighting for the next customer."
good,"Days were long, business was slow, there were a lot of requirements for sales goals when market was slow. I learned a lot about the products but it was only from independent company training and experience, no prior training from company."
good,Typical day at work consist of redoing displays and chatting with some customers and co-workers. I have learned a lot about the company as well as how thing work. My coworkers are great .
good,"It was a great place to work.  Co-workers were a joy to work with. However, there were issues that were not addressed which created an unfriendly atmosphere with employees."
good,the job pays well but you have no quality of life.  employees are easily promoted and then once in mgmt they quit.  Being an employee actually pays more then management and you have the luxuary of working with the cusomers rather than being covered in a desk job.
good,A typical day at work was slow but with an instant it would switch paces and it would be flooded with customers. What I learned was you must approach your customers differently not all of them are the same. Management is great always there when you need them and always happy to assist. Co workers are fine not all of them will be friendly or nice but some will gladly talk to you. Hardest part of the job was everyone would fight for sales it would even lead to arguments in front of customers. Most enjoyable part of the job you meet a lot of new faces meet new people which brings out the comfort zone for everyone.
good,"The pay is great, the people are generally great. They are over staffed so that the customer is asked by 5 people if they need help. To get a raise or to get to full time you have to keep your sales up. To do that you have to steal sales or fight for them because they are over staffed but still have the same numbers. Most of the time the employees are arguing about sales and management allows it."
good,"A tyical day for my department is somewhat laid back, no sales pressure like other associates. Alterations isn't a hard job unless I run into a task I've never experienced. My job is enjoyable and I like going to work on Mondays."
good,I enjoyed working for the company met alot of very nice people however I found it very uncomfortable that one could not associate with management and I also feel some of the upper management talked to the associates in a very demeaning manner and if the floor associates were not pulling in numbers or credit apps for them then they looked down on them.
good,I feel that Dillard's was a great way for me to get my foot into the retail sales door.
good,"A typical day at work will be starting by 9am or 12noon according to my schedule. carry out a team meeting and updating my associates on the goal for the day or month. Brain storm on how to meet individual goals and counter goal. making sure the counter is clean and ready for customers with a smile. I have learnt to be motivated , be an encouraging mentor/coach , leading by example."
good,"Have to be able to multi task. Not only do you manage your people but have to be able to keep up with incoming stock, keeping the store to visual standards.  Be an effective recruiter as well."
good,"My typical day at Dillard's was slow pace but interesting because of the different people to interact with . I learned that no customer likes to have to wait to long and to always be courteous, polite and helpful regardless of how rude a small family of woman who had a great amount of respect for each other. The hardest part of the job was having to reclean your area and then close out your register five minutes before close . The most enjoyable. Having the competitions to see who could sale the most"
good,I loved it here at Dillards. I gained Customer Service skills.
good,I have worked in retail for several years. I find it enjoyable. Associates are always friendly and helpful. The hardest part was not satisfying someof the customers when they are search for something and the store does not carry it. I always strive to find it at other stores.
good,"Being a counter manager was hard work but I really enjoyed the busy seasons. The best part of the job was customer service. Beauty Assessments and makeovers. The hardest part was standing, my feet became a problem. I learned about skin care and top of the line products. I respect Lancome's research and value the products."
good,"I liked this part of the job, ""selling"" . But I felt sometimes the rules of making goals was aggrivating because in order to make goals need to sell more . it was not that fun to make customers to buy because soon they either brought it back or became unhappy for persuading them to buy. The increase of salary for each associate was based on making it's goal. I think for me selling and contact with people was fun because I liked the retail job and I would say Dillard's was a good experience for starting a new job. The funest part was to talk to people and chat with them. Dillard's is very compatitive store and the co-workers are in hard competition even with each others, therefore it was not very friendly atmosphere for associates. I liked the time that I could sell or open the credit card for a customer. I learned to become a good sale person from Dillard's which was my first job and I enjoyed very much when I was working there. I even forgot how time was passing so fast. I learnd and experienced many things in Dillard's including inventory, opening credit card and taking orders from customers. So in one year of my work experience I learned the best part was enjoy working and the worse part was taking un wanted rules that was not very pleasent.. However; after twelve years from my first job at Dillard's I am not that eager to work in retail anymore."
good,"This is great job for part time work, opprotunities for advancement, the knowledge of the product they are selling is important."
good,I loved my job at Dillard's from the beginning . I
good,Overall Dillard's is a friendly and family like atmosphere to be part of but being a single mother with four children ( the youngest 3 years old) it was difficult for me to work retail hours.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of straightening the department, doing price mark downs, waiting on customers, putting out new merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the merchandise they were looking for and making the sale!"
good,"Markdowns done generally on Mondays and Tuesdays. The hardest part of my job is keeping people from shop lifting our items, especially when the ones stealing know that technically I cant do anything to stop them. The most enjoyable part of my job is opening boxes and finding fresh new merchandise and getting to re-set my jewelry cases. I can honestly say that I have learned how to stick to my guns and not be afraid to talk to people."
good,Flexible scheduling availability due to store operating hours. Great pay in general especially for retail.
good,"Great sales people, there is very little micromanagement. The younger you are the better your success to work for Dillard's."
good,fun place good people. worked with my schedule and staff upper staff was nice
good,"Sales are very important for raises work hard and you will have success."
good,Fair and a pleasant work environment. I really enjoyed my time at Dillard's. My co-workers turned into a second family. Paid day off your bday as well!
good,Typical day involves helping clients discover new products and meeting the needs of the client.  My job really was about connecting with clients and building a relationship to determine how to make them feel better about themselves.  Many women are really just looking for something to improve their self esteem and makeup is one of those things that helps an individual.  Workplace culture is fun with lots of incentives.  The group of women I worked with were professional and vey supportive.  The management at this time is very unprofessional and immature and self serving.  I have had management in the past that was professional and supportive.
good,"Learn alot about the seasonal holiday change in the store, customer service and friendly work area. "
good,The job is easy and relaxed but dressing nicely every day can get old. The sales goals are so unrealistic you can never make it every day even you get every sale in your area sometimes you still wont make it. Sometimes makes for a toxic competitive environment.
good,"Very nice place to work for the amount that they pay you. Otherwise, they pressure you to make an impossible goal everyday and if you don't you get fired. Their system really isn't fair and they don't really care half the time just as long as you sell."
good,"I have had a good experience working at Dillard's, especially because of my work associates. They are very helpful and supportive, which is very important when we have to try and meet unrealistic sales quotas. The benefits are good and management is fair with work schedules."
good,They offer their employees very Good Pay and they also have great opportunities to move up and get promoted. You do have a quota everyday that you have to meet on sales so you want to be attentive to your customers.
good,"N/a"
good,"Friendly staff, great working conditions,fast-paced. The training was to provide compassionate customer service and excellent customer service. I really enjoyed working with the public."
good,There were days where personal things started to affect my work and they were concerned without being pushy. I like that they care about their employees and see them as people and not just workers.
good,They were flexible in time off and scheduling for school. Enjoyed the people I worked with but hated how were pitted against each other to compete for sales.
good,Dillard’s have a  productivity system that you to meet in order to keep your employment with the company. It was very challenging at times because other employees would take your customers to meet their  quota.
good,"Not so many people go out shopping anymore so not only Dillards but any retail job is hard but for Dillards,they give you a very high quota and it gets very stressfull!!!"
good,Great pay get paid every week very very competitive you always have a daily goal to me if you fall behind I get returns from customers it puts you in the hall it’s hard to catch up you’re on your feet eight hours a day
good,"You will be compensated for hard work. Very competitive with coworkers, Stressful when its a slow month, but you still have to reach your goal. Money is great, plus they pay weekly."
good,"The quotas were rather high,  but I made mine.  I worked in the Home department and really enjoyed setting up the displays  . The managers could use some help with motivation."
good,I worked many years at Dillards and felt that I was fairly treated. Management for the most part was helpful and friendly. It was fast paced and rarely boring. Lots of nice customers who always shopped with me. I had a loyal clientele and developed friendships with many of them. My co workers were like a work family as many of us had worked together for many years
good,"the hours and pay were great, but  the quotas were completely unfair and unreachable. The expectations were held way too high for beginner sales associates."
good,"welcomes new customers to the store, loved being able to chat and get to know customers.  Needing to know what their wants and needs are."
good,Hourly pay per department is based on sales. You are not given the option  to choose the department you want to work in. If you are moved to another department
good,Working at Dillard's gave me an opportunity to meet and greet more people and enhance my customer service skills. It was a learning tool that I took great advantage of. I would not have any problems with recommending this company to  others.
good,"Dillards offer great benefits such as insurance, vacation pay and sick pay. Dillards pay is great and they have high expectations with quotas as a standard and a raise goal quota."
good,"I enjoyed being Sales Auditor, auditing the previous days' business.  My supervisors were wonderful & helpful. Was in an office with only one other person.  Was disappointed that after 09/11, Mr Dillard decided the Sales Auditor position was superfluous."
good,You always had a goal every day and it was a high goal and if you didn't meet that with in a year you got a 10% pay cut. You were to call the customers and let them know that they had new products and build up your clients.
good,"A nice company to work with.  I worked in Cosmetics for Clinque so basically worked for two companies.  Good management .  Hardest was sometimes the long hours during inventory, etc.  I met a lot of wonderful people and still friends to this day."
good,Loved working at Dillard's until i transferred. Management did not like that I was part time and had a cost of living raise. They became obsessed with pulling me in the office for random issues.
good,The job is very stressful because you have to fight for sales. They give extremely high goals that can be hard to reach when the store is slow. It is also very hard to move up in the company.
good,As a CSR i was able to grow with the company and learn a lot of new things about how to interact with customers and problems that may arise. They are not very flexible when scheduling your weekly schedule so you have open availability and be very specific about when you need days off for doctors appointments and such. But over all it is a very good place to work at.
good,You definitely have to know how to sail to be here and build clientele if you don’t then your numbers will surely show it . But overall it’s not a bad place to work if you are in school.
good,This was a good place to be.  The people were nice and I enjoyed selling the products that I sold.  A typical day at work included stocking the shelves and selling merchandise.
good,"Unrealistic sales goals"
good,"I worked in there jewelry, clothes and shoes department I stocked , cleaned, cashier, unloaded boxes , inventory, counted drawer , made deposits, met new people."
good,"This is a retail job. Be prepared to not have a life outside the work, because the schedules have you there for most of the day, regardless of whether you open or close."
good,Productive upscale department store.  Fashionable trends for every member of the family.  Great merchandise to select from.  Kind of pricy but not over the norm for a garment and excellent sells.
good,"Work hard and you will be rewarded. "
good,"I worked on the Dock and it paid pretty well.  The job was easy and simple, even for people doing introductory work to doing maintenance and stocking."
good,typical day is greeting customers and see what the each customer is looking for maintain knowledge of current sales and promotions. Inventory stock balance cash drawers
good,"I enjoyed working at DSCC.  Management was always available to help in any situation.  It was an informal, family type culture.  Unfortunately, the company closed."
good,Working for Dillards was good work experience. You definitely learn how to work with different kinds of people and get good experience with customers and sales.
good,"Working at Dillard’s, I have learned a lot, cash handling, gift wrapping, working a muilt-phone line, paging system, problem solving skills as well as patients"
good,"Sales are goal oriented, if you don't meet you daily goal you have to make it up another day and if you don't make your goals you can get fired. The environment also includes a lot of gossip around the whole staff."
good,Close and personal customer service experience. I worked the women shoe department and i was able to assist customers on a day to day basis to meet their needs.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Dillard’s. I would like to go back to work for them. Great company and very personal when you need something. Was easy to get a long with others!
good,"Working for Dillard's is not for everyone.  The company is very goal oriented with daily sales goals.  "
good,It was a good experience with a new environment I enjoyed very much would definitely recommend. The trucks and putting up the clothes for each department was new for me.
good,"Worked in Home Furnishings Dept. at  Barton Creek Square Mall in Austin as a Sales Associate.  Typical day at work would include assisting and ringing up sales (Never ran a POP terminal before, so that was different!) People would call you and ask you to help them look for something in a different dept. Spent several years in retail before this. But this was more intensive retail.we seem to spend more time on the sale than actually helping them out, I thought.I just like to be out on the floor helping others, that was my favorite part."
good,"I would recommend that the management work with its employees schedules better. At my store, they had part-time employees working 12 hour shifts nearly every single day, and threatened to fire them when they would call in only twice."
good,I really loved working there until my store manager and assistant manager were both promoted at the same time. I did not get along with the new management and left shortly after they started.
good,"A typical work day included creating and arranging displays, keeping the work areas clean, helping customers, and stocking merchandise. "
good,It is a very hard working place but pretty much laid back. Good management as well..  Hot at times and nice people.  It is a great place to work. stack pallets load and unload trucks etc
good,"I loved working at dillards. between the two years i was there i was Promoted twice, transfered stores, and went from a part time employee to Visual Manager over entire store. I miss my Dillards family!"
good,"must maintain daily quota in a very competitive environment"
good,"clock in 5 minutes before scheduled time,open cash register,process/run merchandise on sales floor and back stock room,dust store fixtures and wipe down mirrors when necessary and sale,sale,sale."
good,Good pay but stressful job you have to stay on top of your sales and not let your quota accumulate or else you can get fire for not making your sales . Your co workers can be competitive and sometimes is hard to make your day when it’s a lot of them working and if it’s a slow sale day
good,The job is easy until the year reaches the slow months where it becomes impossible to reach the company's insanely high sales quotas at which point after a prescribed amount of time the store will fire you but if they like you they will drop your pay and move you to another department or forgive your deficit. Coworkers can be very hostile and aggressive as is normal in many sales jobs it is very normal to see two coworkers get into a verbal argument over a lost sale.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard's and I would work there again. The environment was fun to work in and I liked my supervisors. The job is super easy! If you like working in sales, you would probably enjoy working at Dillard's."
good,Working at Dillard's as a Customer Service Rep can sometimes be challenging. It takes alot of patience and CS skills when dealing with customers. The associates are friends and very helpful. Neat and clean working environment.
good,I went from 1800 bridal to corporate and develops 10 key skill and general ledger also worked a multiline phone I learned alot about how to spot associate stealing and enjoyed working there
good,"The Manager was a nice person who cares about every employee in the store, he meets with the employee every morning and encourages everyone to do his best."
good,"Loved my 5 years, had 5 different store managers and high turnover for employees as well because of the quota system mainly. Management was poor some years but other than that awesome company to work for. Learned how to fit suits, push brands, product knowledge and learned how to become a salesman. Became a pacesetter and employee of the month a few times. Discount was the best part by far but the entire job was fun. Long days because you’re working mall hours so rarely do you have time to do anything after but if you want to make your numbers you have to work. Would still be there if our store didn’t close."
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their question and concerns. Assisting them with what to wear and giving my input when needed. It was a nice company were I can interact with customers
good,"I was a part time employee, but worked almost equivalent to full time hours. Management was nice, but could be better at times. Life accommodation was often nonexistent. The best part of working for Dillard's was the people-customers and employees alike."
good,"Dillard's hires in at a high hourly rate but; to maintain that rate you have to meet hourly sales goals for a specified review period.  Usually 3 - 6 months.  However, goals are usually fairly high and difficult to maintain.  Therefore, it is a good chance that you will face a hourly pay reduction.   If you miss your SPH goals for 3 reviews you may find yourself unemployed. The system has several flaws because you are assigned to specific areas and if your area is slower that other areas you will have difficulty acheiving your goals."
good,"Volume, expectations, and company policy are inconsistent from store to store. I worked at two different locations in the same region and it was like working for two different companies."
good,Dillards was a great place to work and taught me a lot about customer service and how to get customers exactly what they like. I'd recommend all my friends and family to work here.
good,My expirence there was amazing. I loved my work staff  and all the events we use to have all the time it was a pleasure to work there. A great job for anyone in sales.
good,"Dillard's has good pay and benefits for a retail position. Sales can be very competitive, and if you don't make your sales quotas you could lose your job. For the most part, I enjoyed my time at Dillard's and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent job."
good,Great experience working with customers on a one on one basis. Giving customers the best customer service in retail atmosphere is biggest goal. pleasant atmosphere.
good,"depending what department you work in the job can feel different to many. but for myself, working in kids shoes was a challenge, Dillards expects you to sale a certain amount each day you work."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's was assisting customers with merchandise selections, opening and closing the department. I learned to increase sells with the training seminars provided. The management worked on every level of the store and were called to approve customer large purchases. The hardest part of the job was working weekends and late evenings with young children.The most enjoyable part  of working at Dillard's was working with friends and meeting customers who became friends."
good,"They pay fairly, there is opportunity to get a raise if you make your sales goals but in the store I worked it was impossible to make numbers. The sales goals pin employees against each other including my immediate manager which creates problems in itself. My biggest reason for leaving is being completely unable to ask for a day off. It never gets approved"
good,The culture in the buying office is weird. Everyone keeps to themselves. They work there assistants to the bones and its hard for them to keep good people. A lot of the buyers have been there forever.
good,"I would say that the company is very family oriented."
good,"A typical day at work was highly varied. There were days when a shipment would come in and we would have to stock it on the shelves. Some days, when items would go on sale, we would have to rearrange the department. The one constant was looking out for customers and giving them the best shopping experience. I began by learning much about all clothes, then when I became the suit specialist, I learned everything I could about the suits I sold. Management was not fluid at all. Upper management, the general manager of the store, and the department manager were all on different pages with what needed to be done and how. The culture of DIllard's was very cut-throat as everyone worked for commission. The hardest part about the job was trying to make all the managers happy, and redoing things when one of them was not happy. The most enjoyable part of the job by far was interacting one on one with a customer when I was selling a suit. Creating a relationship and trust between me and them was fun and very fulfilling."
good,Stressful retail environment. Difficult to balance home life and work life. Retail work hours fluctuate depend upon needs of the store. Must be prepared to work lots of weekends and holidays.
good,great pay can advance in company fast if you are willing to relocate and like to travel around. Good discount meet new people from all walks of life..
good,"This was the first time I worked in retail.  Although very competitive, I really enjoyed the customer service, and the overall professionalism of the company."
good,They expect you to work until the job is done. Frequent corpoate visits. If you’re salary you are working for more than the job is worth. Not much of a wok/life balance.
good,Great Manager and support working in the Home department. Working on shipments while a truck came in to display new products there was always plenty to do and stay busy and focused. Markdowns were being be placed daily. Sale and push items were a must.
good,The store over all is cool but there is little room to move to full time if you are part time. Some of the sales requirements are ridiculous for the are that my location is in and what type of people live in the area and the general income. There is too much pressure in sales period. It makes you not enjoy your job which has a very strong effect on progress.
good,Very fast paced and always on your feet. I did not like how you were hit with less commission if someone returned a product you did not check them out for.
good,"I personally liked working for dillards because I loved the environment, the typical dillards customers are quiet and polite and the store is never dirty or chaotic. The discounts are great too. The only problem was that the sale quota keeps going up every time you reach it making it almost impossible to keep a job there unless you make it to full time."
good,"A very competitive sale culture. "
good,A typical day at work is productive assisting customers with merchandise purchases. The work place culture is relaxed yet stressful in producing your quoter. The hardest part of the job is keep you quoter up. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and assisting them with their purchases.
good,good job great people great experience great opportunity. Yes I enjoyed working there I learned a lot. Yes I would love to work there again if given the opportunity.
good,"Dillards is all about the numbers. If you can sell, and meet your quotas, you are golden. If not, you get a pay decrease and eventually fired. 2 inch heels are mandatory for women, they don’t care if you get your breaks, and no sitting on the job. Not many perks, except to hound you about numbers."
good,"* Meeting daily goals, interacting with customers. Also keep up on product knowledge and stocking."
good,This was a nice place to work. My coworkers ranged from long time employees to seasonal workers and workers coming in for part time work after working their 9 to 5 jobs. A great mix of people and personalities.
good,"Dillard's has a calm, clean, friendly working atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed working in Women's Designer clothes because I could see the latest styles."
good,A typical day at work consist of customers service and sales. I now have extensive knowledge about James Avery products (certified specialist) and many others. Dillard's provides an exciting work place! The only thing challenging about working for this establishment was the inability to set a consistent schedule to follow. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and talking to people.
good,I worked at a very slow skin care counter. Pay was good. Poor management. The hardest part about the job was the fact that it was slow and standing on your feet all day. Was boring a lot of the time. I enjoyed my co workers. Great discounts. Payday was every Thursday.
good,"Quotas are hard to reach, some days are slower than others and some days you will exceed your quota for the day which is an amazing feeling. I learned a lot of new things, actually, for example how to get your'clientele' and how to recruit. I loved the department I worked in. The hardest part of the job was to meet your quota on a slow day, yes you could call your clients but most of the time those clients do not want to buy that day. The most enjoyable part of that job would be the events that would be held during the holidays and so on. You get to meet amazing people, I met a lot of amazing makeup artists which i am so thankful for."
good,"It can be stressful having to deal with customers, managers, etc. but the pay makes it worth it. Just be careful, because they tend to have very strict/annoying rules about everything (cellphone/food/sitting/visitors/etc)."
good,Very good company to work for..a fast paced environment that is a good work atmosphere for the employees and employer. Felt as if you can easily talk to management.
good,"As a shopping location I would recommend this company to everyone. It has the best sales prices on high end brand names of any retailer. As a place to work I think they should pay according to longevity, and sales incentives."
good,"fun place to work,easy job and They pay attention to employee recognition and appreciation and having a special way to recognize and honor good work. Excellent communication between management and staff."
good,It is steady pace environment to work in. You learn how to interact with customers and work on interpersonal skills with other employees. The workplace culture is friendly and i enjoy helping customers find the right products that fit them.
good,Have to constantly push sales dollars per hour and credit applications. Management expects you to make sales while also maintaining stock and resetting the area.
good,It is a great place to work. You have lots of chances for advancement. The management is great to work for. They are fair and care about you. The hardest part about the job is working during holidays

good,"A typical day consisted of making sure the store was presentable"
good,A typical day at Dillard's was never the same.  Some days very busy and some not so.  My job consisted of sales and receiving inventory and distributing it.  Management was stressful .  The  hardest part of the job was trying to make sales when business was very slow.
good,"It's a fun work environment depending on which department you're working in. Only cons that I would say is that if you do not open credit applications with customers that they will hold that against you. Also you will have a daily sales goal that if you do not meet, it will roll over onto your next workday. Management is ok, however, they will look out and help who the want to help."
good,the best part of working for Dillards is the pay and being able to help customers. I enjoy interacting with customers and helping them. Management is wonderful
good,"this job afforded me the experience of honing excellent customer service skills and purchasing abilities along with marketing excellence, but again i worked long hours and weekends"
good,"Was a dock worker at the local Dillards. Not a bad gig, just be ready to deal with all different types of situations. Although getting time off was not easy, and my boss was never there. Hard to know what to do when nobody is their to tell you."
good,"I really enjoyed being able to help clients put together suits and outfits for big events such as weddings and interviews. I learned that each person has their own unique style, and that even though at first some patters and colors may not seem to go together, you would be surprised at how it turns out, and that edge gives you notice."
good,"Work was the same every day, wonderful supervisors, and a fun work environment. We had a good mixture of both fun, and work while there, and always got the job done."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working and getting to know the employees and managers. The promotions were always fun. The hours weren't bad at all.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Dillard's! I worked part-time but I had consistent hours. One problem I did have was with having a ridiculous quota, which was my downfall. Other than that management and the other employees were fun and informative."
good,"It really is a good place to work. Coworkers are kind and helpful. They start everyone out at $12/hr. Some managers are cool, but some are strict. Lots of opportunities for raises and to move up in the company. There is no commission (unless you work in shoes), but they make up for it by paying employees well. Aslo its just kind of an old fashioned place, computers and registers are outdated. But I had an over-all good experience."
good,Typical day consisted of watching for thieves whether it was customers or other employees. Management was hard to work for at times. Hardest part I found working for Dillards was racial issues.
good,"Great place to work if able to stand on feet 6+ hours daily, very competitive with sales, must be available to work some nights, weekends, and all holidays"
good,"In this store i learned what I need to do with my life. I learned  about customer service, how to assist the customers, how to sell products, how ro present a product foe sell."
good,Gained sales learning experience and also a lot about customer relationships and merchandise at Dillard's. The money you could earn here was unbeatable!
good,"Everyone on staff at Dillards is very friendly and outgoing. Also, gained a lot of work experience in my time there.The hardest part of the job was conflict resolution with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting to help customers solve issues that they were having."
good,"The shifts are long depending if your full or part time, some weeks you might be required to close 2 or more nights, 30 minutes to an hour break depending on how many hours you are scheduled"
good,Received my experience in retail here.  My supervisor was great and was knowledgable about the store and merchandise.  I really enjoyed meeting new people and providing outstanding customer service to them.
good,It was hard to keep your quota up when you were subtracted for every return. Especially when you were switched between departments with very different price point merchandise.
good,I had to opportunity to work with great people. helping customers. kind of did a little bit of decorating when helping customers make their selections.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of dusting the counters, removing fingerprints from the glass cases, ensuring that the products were properly displayed in the case, putting away product from the boxes delivered to counter and also to display large posters of the newest products at the top of our station. Our main focus was to gain a general consensus of what type of smell and auxiliary products the customer might use. I used my knowledge of the ingredients/smells to make the best suggestions for the customers."
good,very great part time job i would work mostly just weekends it was during the time i was going to school so i was more focused on school than work but the pay was good for just a part time job

good,There is nothing special about this job. You see a lot of people come and go here. I am a hard worker so I showed up and I did my job.
good,"Dillard's was a great place to work, every day was different and you make a lot of great friendships with employees and customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of building relationships with individual customers, asking questions, finding out their needs, likes, and dislikes. Presenting merchandise you think may interest, or benefit them in order to build up their shopping experience with you."
good,"I would open or close, make sure the correct amount of money were in the drawers. If my manager was there I would ask if she had any tasks for me to do, otherwise I would just do the typical go backs, taking clothes from the fitting rooms and putting them back on the floor where they belong. I would make sure all hangers were in their correct form. Make sure all tags and garbage were off the floor. Maintain up keep of all aisles. My co workers and managers were all fun."
good,Enjoy working there.Not enough hours.Low pay.not enough hours offered therefore insurance not an option.I need more hours to be able to afford insurance.
good,"I love working there and my co workers are great.  I am looking more for full time and not in a retail setting."
good,Just put in the work and it pays off. You will learn how to set sales and the basics of retail. Co worker are there to help you gain sales right along with management.
good,"A typical day at work for me, began with clocking in before store opening, logging into the system with my employee i.d. number, counting my drawer, and going to designated area where my supervisor called the team meeting. There, we discuss sales goals, current sales events and rules regarding them, sales floor layout, items to push, and questions frequently asked by customers for immediate problem solving. Upon ending the meeting, the doors are unlocked and the customers are greeted, assisted with items, dressing rooms and purchases. There are returns, exchanges, suit and dress shirt measurements, and recommendations regarding clothing, suit alterations, accessories, shoes, and fragrances. I was often so busy, that time flies by quickly, and before I know it, it's time to clock out. I organize my sales floor area, my work station, count my drawer, take any damaged items to my supervisor's office, and clock out. What I've learned, which is very important to me, is that although you and your coworkers are competition, you are still on the same team. Management is professional, open to suggestions, yet firm with rules. The hardest part about working at Dillard's was leaving. I loved my job, but my physician's orders was to stop working at least a week before I gave birth. What I enjoyed the most was reaching goals, and that began first with satisfied customers."
good,"I do not wish to review. I had great co-workers, and the customers were great.  I had a problem with one individual and I requested a transfer to another store and was deigned.  I was having a serious problem that was not taken seriously.  I have heard from many employees of Dillard's that they have loved their job."
good,Was a sales associate waiting on customers doing inventory and cleaning area when time to close.Putting up new inventory and always putting things back where they belonged
good,"A typical day at work would consist of people trying to reach their sales quota. "
good,"A typical day at Dillard's is full of surprises! The day consist of many different tasks including inventory, markdowns, scheduling, conference calls, staff meetings, manager meetings, and coming up with a goals for associates to make sales plan."
good,Dillards moves its employees around to give them a chance to find which department they excel at. Dillards provides its employees with an abundance of knowledge to provide the best experience for the customer.
good,it was an okay place to work. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. Management could be improved a little. overall it was very inlighting
good,Dillard's is a better department store. The location I worked at was more like a family oriented store.  All the clients knew the sales associates and the managers were really supportive of the sales associates.
good,"The customers who come into the store were very respectful, courteous, and genuine. I believe in customer service and it was very important to me to give the best customer service possible."
good,"Sales was always key in this position, up sell the current trends to customers.  A typical day, I would sell $1000+, per shift.  Management, was good as long as you met your quotas.  My co-workers, on the most part were excellent, like in any sales business, it could get catty at times, but keeping a level head, and knowing your customers needs, proved to be a positive balance.  Hardest part of the job, competition.  The competitiveness of some of the co-workers was unprofessional at times.  I understand companies look for aggression, go-getters if you will, but how much is too much.  The most enjoyable was when I not only reached or exceeded my quotas, but each and every customer was satisfied with my professionalism and customer service."
good,"While working for Dillard's I learned a great deal about the business world. I enjoyed competing with my fellow associates to meet a daily sales quota and help the customers find their needs. Although finding some days harder than the others to meet my goals i pushed through and did my best. Everybody was great (including the customers) and while ill miss them dearly, now, i'm looking forward to what the future holds."
good,My time at Dillards taught me how to manage my time and how to multi task as needed from floor to floor. Dillards staff were friendly and supportive.
good,"Dillard's honestly is a great place to work. The people were great, job its self was great as well. I would recommend working at Dillard's to others."
good,I enjoy sales and would meet and exceed my daily sales quota. I enjoyed working as a team with the other sales associates. I worked over the holidays and became very familiar with the brand names.
good,"For the most part, a typically day was making the highest sales in the store. I made my set goals most of the time. However, the management was poor, co-workers was mostly unhappy. The hardest part of my day was dealing the managers. I feel they were unhappy also because their superiors were always on them. The happiest part of my day was helping my customers...."
good,"You learn a lot on the job. There are quotas for sales and it really does depend on what department you work in. Co-workers are generally friendly though can be competitive, due to the quotas. I made some lasting friends at the job. To make it you really do need to be full-time."
good,"They have high expectations, which they tell you right away. I wish business was a little better and more steady, but that's out of your control. Management is okay. You get great discounts."
good,I loved working with the other associates and selling to their loyal customers. My one complaint was the competitiveness that comes with the personal sales goals each associate has.
good,"While I loved what I did at Dillard's, there was not enough training for my title.  I would have loved to have been able to stay, but it was more stress than I could handle and management needed a few training classes on how to be humane."
good,"Job taught me different human behaviors,  ability to identify different personalities and  to communicate effectively with them even in heightened situations."
good,"loved my Dillards family but the sales goals were unrealistic for the area they are in. Great management  and supervisors, great pay. Benefits were ok. Hours were long."
good,"If you have a string competitive drive, you will thrive in Dillard's. They reward making sales goals and meeting service metrics."
good,Dillard's takes really great care of you while working there. The money is good for what you do and they are understanding if you need off for certain reasons.
good,"Customer service jobs are very important professions to obtain. As the worker you deal with clients from different backgrounds, beliefs, values, and morals. So when obtaining a job which consist of customer service, one has to make sure that he/she personality meets the customers needs. That's what I enjoyed while working at Dillard's. I enjoyed my clients. I enjoyed making their days and helping them find what they needed."
good,You will make friends with all types of people. The pay is amazing but the goal is way to far out to reach. Reward for employees are good paid lunches and gifts for holidays.
good,Sales is always difficult. Aggressive to customers. Always busy and multi-tasking. table audits and stock room work is always needed. daily
good,I learned how to upscale and meet my quota on a daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to met customer needs and help women leave out the store in the junior's department.
good,I really enjoyed the class of customers.  The company pays better than most other retailers.  Benefits are not the best.  You get a descent associate discount.
good,"The management overall is weak and needs to be more aware of those under them and helping more. I would recommend working at Dillards for those who take they're work seriously. There is no room for those who are not committed to the work ethics that are placed on the employees who dont want to work. Working with a weak team can make it hard for the whole group and that would be the hardest part of the job besides the added chores that have nothing to do with our position? Overall I find Dillards to be a good place to work, but could be even better if the management would work together more."
good,Its a nice company to work for while going to I was in college. My co-workers were fun to work with. It was good retail learning experience.
good,"Help customers with whatever they need, room to get further in company and somewhat flexible with schedules. Great pay and business managers care about employees"
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and in retail. However, if commission was not met our hourly pay would go down significantly. If commission was met, hourly pay would not change."
good,This is a place where you meet a higher class of client and have a more professional frame of mind. Teaches people a sense of fashion and appeals to a trend oriented crowd. Employees are very friendly and management is always helpful. They are very profit oriented and assign every employee a set monetary goal which must be met in order to receive a raise. This often causes a very high turn over within the company. Employees are given a generous discount and long lunch breaks. They offer a nice 401K matching program and there health benefits were not too bad.
good,Great pay and the opptunity for growth within the company is there iff you are a productive worker.  I went from an associate to an area manager in 6 months but you have to work for it
good,"It has the potential to be a lot of fun if you work with the right people. You get what you put into the job in return. Pay is not that bad, hours are good"
good,A typical day at work is helping customers look for the right outfit with some of the best name brands in clothes. Learned how to assist customers while folding and pressing clothes.
good,"There isn't really anything typical about my days. I never know what is going to happen. I plan about 30% of my day and leave the rest open for reaction. Retail is always in motion and things change rapidly. The ability to change with them is crucial for success. I work with the entire store. Store manager to dock associate. The core of my job is to train the staff visually and help maintain the company standards. The reality of what I do goes far beyond that. There is no task too small or large. One day I might be in a suit walking with executives and another I might be using power saws to make tables. What I enjoy most about my job is the mobility. I am never standing still. My store has three floors, and I spend my day going between them. The hardest part of my job is maintaining a certain level of standards. It takes constant supervision and organization. As a whole I enjoy my co-workers. Most of them work hard because I work hard. I would never ask someone to do what I would not do as well."
good,"I performed customer duties, merchandising and clienteling.   Staff was friendly and helpful.  It was a competitive selling environment so as an associate you had to be focused."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Dillard's and feel as though I learned a lot by participating in their leadership development program. I was able to develop my leadership skills while learning about the retail industry and the challenges faced by management. While more and more shopping is being done online, it is now, more than ever, important to push customer service and maintain client relationships. I was able to participate in many activities such as scheduling and inventory control. I was also able to monitor sales goals and participate in employee coaching."
good,"My experience at Dillard's has been good, it is a nice place to work. The pay is better than most retail positions. I have been able to better hone my customer service skills dealing with people one on one and have built great relationships with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with the quota that has to be met because your job depends on it. I enjoy working with my customers and my co-workers."
good,"Boosts up your self confidence with dealing with customers, and you make a quota to get paid. Have to have a sense of fashion to make you projects in your section work."
good,Dillard's is a great company to work for if you love retail. You have the option for career advancement and get to meet a lot of people.
good,I loved selling men's clothing and men's suits! Being a personal shopper for those in need of an outfit is very rewarding experience for me to complete. Putting together an outfit for a gentleman is when my creative side takes off!!
good,"its been so long since I can remember, but what I can say is that the people were I worked with were like family. everyone cared for each other and worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the constant changing of the displays because we would work so hard on a project, then a day or two later we would take it down and start another one, but at the same time we got to work together in groups and met some really good people."
good,"I would hire and train staff. Up selling new and pre existing clients. Putting together marketing objectives, and setting sales goals."
good,"Let's face it, retail is still retail. You have your good days and then you have your bad days, but what job doesn't?"
good,I loved working for this company.They start  you off with great pay and they paid me every week.good staff and great clientele
good,The company is great for people going to college. You can work on your school work and assist customer on the phone. the call center has two departments: furniture and retail and i did both.
good,The hours and pay are good. You must watch out for other associates stealing your sales / customers. If you are in a slow area such as the Home Dept. watch out you can and will be fired if you don't meet your sales goals daily. Management ...will not help you improve your selling skills to up your sales. In fact they can lie.
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers in making sales purchases. Providing quality customer service to customers and helping them in their shopping needs. Setting up floor and counter displays. Also, merchandising, stocking, inventory and creating and working store sales and markdowns were apart of my daily work routine. I also assisted customers with making phone and online purchases. On this job I learned how staying positive and upbeat with create higher sales and an overall better shopping experience for the customer. This job required tact in regards to working with other co-workers because the salary was based on quota. The hardest part about this job was the schedules. Management did not like to work with you if you had family emergencies or school priorities. The most enjoyable part about this job was meeting and working with different people. I enjoyed working with different customers and making relationships that allowed new customers to become regular customers."
good,Not a bad gig. Not very many opportunities to move up unless you are in the group or know someone. Overall nice experience.

good,"Learn to work with high fashion goods.  How to merchandise, show and sell it on a daily occurrence.   Train and educate sale associate on features and benefits of product.

good,The group would unload the trucks and have the merchandise to the floor before the store opens. when we are not loading we are helping customers and helping other employees.
good,Great job! Very nice place to work. You got to dress nice for work and discount on all merchandise. Learned to be very professional in sales.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job Is putting a smile on the customers' faces after helping them. I like building relationships with the customers who over time become my clients who come in to see and buy product from only me.
good,"5s and team building positives are practiced ."
good,"A typical day you are required to do an hour of stock where put new merchandise out and organize it in the stockroom so other associates can find it. Then you help customers find what they need, while showing them new merchandise which leads to bigger sales. "
good,"It was a great experience working at Dillard's, at times it wasn't very busy therefore I always got a lot done. Every other few days we always scanned through items that were going on sale, and on other days we got shipment in that needed to be put away. I learned how to multitask properly dealing with my department and the customers. My co-workers were a lot of fun, and got along with them great! The hardest part was having to contact my manager, she was in charge of the cosmetics department and it seemed like she didn't care much for my Junior's department. The most enjoyable part was interacting with great customers and getting to know my co-workers."
good,"Great company, I always did my best in fulfilling customer needs ."
good,it was a nice environment of workplace however it is to hard to keep up those high sales goals in a small and empty mall.

good,"They took good care of the children and the school and the environment around them, providing good food and bible teachings."
good,"Great place to grow as a professional, very good salary and benefit package."
good,The hardest part of job would be I would never know my hours from week to week. A typical work day would be seeing my team make their goal. I learned to treat every co-worker the same. The most enjoyable part of my job was to make the customers happy.
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Just didn't enjoy having monthly quotas when you don't get many customers. Loved assisting customers with their needs. Wonderful employees as well.
good,"Fun atmosphere, Great opportunity to learn business. A lot of nice people."

good,"Dillard's enhanced me in many ways.  Before I began to work for the company, I was not confident in personal selling and having a clientele.  Management taught us thoroughly how to build an unforgettable relationship with the customers.  They taught us how to engage and add on different things to help other departments within the store.  I really enjoyed wardrobing the clients who came into the store.  Being that I worked in contemporary, the department was already fun and up to date when it came to fashion."
good,"Meet new people "
good,"•	Trained and specialize in shoe sales "
good,I honestly enjoy working for Dillard's. It offers a competitive pay and a flexible schedule. The hardest part is selling in the home department because it's rare when customers come by.

good,"Sell, sell sell to customers. Easy fun job if you can get your sales. Its hard to make your sales quota unless your in a high sales area. The employees that have worked there longest have the best departments. All but one manager was unprofessional. If you don't make your sales quota you WILL loose your job, no matter how hard you work or how long you worked there.  I left before my 1st review.  They started me at a pretty good rate, I made more than most of the sales associated that had been there for a long time.  You can get little bonus' for selling items, they run different contests.  The best part of the job is dressing nice and looking professional everyday.  I met a lot of nice customers and co-workers.  I would still work there if I didn't have to worry about loosing my job because of sales pressure."
good,"Family owned company that appreciates its employees.  Management is fair to all.  Though much is expected of you, especially during the holidays, the owners do not make us report for work at midnight for extended hours.

Team building and developing everyday.......The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the clients and making a impact on their lifestyles,and understanding their tastes and meeting their needs........"
good,"Assist and clean up after customers"
good,Meeting new people everyday help them in there need and wants of fashion
good,The job was awesome just needed more money. The advancement was hard
good,Loved the fact I worked in the beauty industry. It allowed me to find a career in the industry.
good,"I assisted customers with returns, problem solving, and gift wrapping.  I was responsible for counting the cash drawers and registers when opening and closing the customer service department."
good,"A typical day at work started by opening and counting the registers in six different departments. Helping many customers find the perfect accessory.  I learned to keep a great attitude at Dillard's no matter what and to give the very best customer service possible. The hardest part of the job was Dillard's raise policy. Dillard's would cut your pay if you didn't meet your sales goal.  They would give you a raise if you made your raise goal.Though I never had my pay cut, some employees did and they would develop a bad attitude.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be helping my customers find the perfect handbag or accessory and making them smile.  I truly enjoyed the customers and went out of my way to make them happy.  I would go the extra mile for them. I would also work on markdowns, restocking new merchandise, and I would help the assistant sales manager with what ever project she needed. I am a people person and can get along with just about anyone.  My co-workers and management all worked as team players."
good,Enjoyable to work with the makeup and new products.  I felt that Dillard's sales quotas were somewhat high causing a stressful situation among employees trying to compete for customers.  The hours weren't the best having to work nights and weekends.
good,"A typical day of work at Dillard's consisted of keeping the work area presentable, maintaining visual merchandise, attending to customer concerns and requests, demonstrating and selling fragrances and skin care products, striving to meet sales goals and keeping in contact with clientele."
good,"Typical day at work was a 12 hours shift from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m."
good,"This job had good hours, decent benefits and I made many good friends there.  I enjoyed my day helping customers with there shopping needs. The hardest part of the job is trying to make your quota, when other employess tried to take your customers. However, it became easier by getting to know your customers and building a data base and callling them in for appointments. or just by letting them when the sales started and they would come in and ask for you by name.  I enjoyed helping customers find everything they needed, and also helped with alterations."
good,"Management was great. Very difficult to work. Had a sales goal and was hard to keep up with, because there were no customers."
good,Customer service. trying to make more sales to meet quotas. assisting customers with their needs. checking out customers. and making sure they got the customer service the need.
good,Retail gave me further knowledge of my supervisory skills. I was taught how to effectively take care of customers in a positive manner.
good,"You're encouraged to sell sell sell as with most retail situations. I think Dilliards GM said it best in a meeting. ""We (Dillards) don't sell things you need. We sell things you want!"" I found it fun, fast, paced, and competitive. Managers for the most part were very knowledgeable and helpful."
good,my day at work starts with housekeeping duties. afterwards we usually unload a truck if there is one avaipable. Trucks usually come in 2-3 times a week. then we process merchandise from truck. Also assist customers and store associates with help. maintain a clean work area.
good,"I worked at this company for 2 and a hlf years. I was promoted from Sales Accosiate to Denim Specialist at my six month review. A year later I was promoted to Business Manager. There is room for growth if you apply yourself and work hard. Finding the very delicate balance between generating sales to surpass your SPH, and staying on top of the daily tasks of a retial accosiate such as visual merchandising, markdowns, go-back and general maintainance of the department is challanging, but rewarding. Sometimes the atmosphere can be a bit competitive because of the high SPHs, so knowing how to resolve internal conflicts is a must."
good,When working there the managers all gave opportunity for people to grow with in their company structure. They always were there to help out with anything you needed help with and tried their best to meet your overall needs with in the company.
good,I worked in the home and china section. The best part was handling the bridal registries and working with the couples and customers shopping off of the lists. I enjoyed the customer service experience.
good,"Taking care of customers, helping them find the right shoe for them. I learned different brand of shoes. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a monthly quota and with so many co-workers working the floor at the same tie it was almost impossible. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting all kinds of people."
good,"cool place good pay and discounts on merchandise and hour lunch break its all good baby,"
good,"I am a hard worker, team player, efficient in my work, strive for perfection and very friendly. I like sales but am looking for more clerical, data entry, administrative work as well. I am great with computers and a fast learner. I love being around people and constantly staying busy."
good,Managerial duties that included overseeing of 4 department locations.
good,"Management is very flexible with school schedules if you are a college student. I learned how to work in retail, they were very patient and friendly, hardest part was inventory and organizing everything and getting used to where everything went. But the most enjoyable part were working with most of my co-workers. "
good,"A typical day includes assisting customers, merchandising, and operating the cash register. The most enjoyable part of working for Dillard's is making a customer happy when you find exactly what they are looking for. "
good,A typical day includes unloading and loading trucks. Dispersing merchandise & crushing boxes. Any task that is given by my supervisor plus any other task needing my assistance by additional managers. Dock nightly duties & housekeeping must be done at the last hour of shift before clock out.
good,"As a Men's Shoes Salesperson, I help clients understand the long-term benefits of having a good pair of shoes, and help them decide which pair of shoes fits their individual style and physical needs. By necessity I have to keep a neat and orderly stockroom, so that I, and my co-workers, will be able to find any shoe a client may need promptly. In order to attract potential clients, I find it helpful to keep the display floor clean and orderly, adding a certain level of aesthetic appeal, and providing a reason for random passersby to stop in and take a look, aside from of course, the big comfy chairs."
good,"I learned patience and excellent CSR skills. I really enjoying working with people and sales, so that made the job worthwhile."
good,"Dillard's is a great, fast-paced, fashionable place to work."
good,Didn't care too much for the managers.  They have too many.  I really didn't care to work every weekend and holiday.
good,"As an employee i worked in the Juniors deptartment my co-workers and i basically were in charge of our floor. Which i enjoyed. It was in our hands how our deptartment looked and how we treated each customer. A typical day would be, go in open the 3 registers we had, be sure all the merchandise were organized and put together with the certain groups it belonged. Go online to our clientele data base be sure to keep in contact with our customers we had a quota to meet everyday as well as a credit application goal per month. Also to approach and assure every customer walked out of our area satisfied or happy with our service. Got kind of competitive at times but that kept it fun and everyone on thier toes. I enjoyed it very much but was not my career choice. "
good,"Its been a decent year and a half. I typically go in open up a couple registers and get ready for customers. Some days are busy some are dead. Some days you have stock to do or markdowns. I usually get my stuff done before everyone else so I just chill and wait on customers the rest of the time. Pretty much if your numbers are good you can do what you want. People who have been there for years get let go because of a couple bad weeks, while people who dont show up or are under some kind of influence get a slap on the wrist. Other than the favoritism, management is good. Sometimes I believe I know more about things than my managers but thats neither here nor there."
good,"Building sales in /out store /beauty advisor, skin care advisor, conducting and producing makeovers, building new client’s data base, organizing special events, assisting in training. Listen and caring to guest needs, meeting and exceeding guest expectation, producing inventory projects. Heavy communication and interaction with guests."
good,"Dillards, Inc. is an overall nice place to work. The production(incentive) system is nice, but there is no room for growth/advancement. I would recommend Dillards for a person who doesn't want to be in management."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I really liked all of my co-workers and most of the management was outstanding. There was some pressure regarding sales, but nothing that couldn't be handled"
good,I love working with people because you can learn something new each day.
good,"I love working with people, learning different aspect on how the dept. are coordinated to entice customers to want to buy. the overall of the job is priceless when it comes to learning about retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with different characters, my coworkers & customers are fantastic, I truly enjoy. The Business Manager is very professional, which I like, she know how to diligent work to us, which only enhances our knowledge. The hardest part of my job with Dillard's is the hours are not consistent to enjoying a balance life."
good,"A typical day is going into work and cleaning racks, reorganizing, and helping customers. We also have mark downs so we have to multitask between doing those and helping customers. My coworkers are amazing and I look forward to working with them when I go in. All of the managers are nice and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you get really busy helping multiple people at once. The most enjoyable part of the job are my coworkers who have become great friends."
good,"On a typical day, it is required for each associate to maintain individual and department quotas. I LOVE my coworkers, however upper management aren't very personable. Micro managing is monotonous. There are different parts of the seasons where hours will be cut. Just starting out, it's a good job as a stepping stone."
good,Great place to work. Got along good with everyone. Nice managers. Nice coworkers. Flexible schedules.
good,"A typical day was me selling multiple pairs of shoes to customers to make my commisions higher. I helped with displays, stocking, cleaning and inventory."
good,At Dillards you pay goes off of your sales per hour.. So make sure u can sell or u won't be there long.
good,"An average day working at Dillard's is like meal time at the watering hole. Dillard's is on a sales per hour pay system, which is fine besides the fact that coworkers pretty much attack customers to get the sale. Anyways, after the morning meeting we all go open about three registers and get ready to start selling. The morning usually starts off pretty slow. My department manager comes around and tells us our sales goal for the day and tell us what we need to do to improve our section. I usually try to lighten the mood by actually talking to him, maybe tell him a joke or two and agree on what I have to do for the day. Once that is done I start in on cleaning up my section from the night of shoplifting before, Dillard's gets a lot of shoplifters. I clean until I see a customer walk by and I ask what they are looking for, after light conversation on the weather, holiday plans, family, I finally know exactly what they need/want/desire. I walk them around my department and sell them as much as they are willing to purchase. It is then time for a quick fifteen minute break so on my way out I tell a few coworkers so they have a heads up to keep an eye on my department. I drink some of my tea then head back to the selling floor, its time for my coworkers to take their breaks so I keep and eye on the whole floor. I find more customers and help them find what they are looking for and take my last break. I continue to sell and clean, sell and clean, sell and clean. After about eight hours it's time for me to clock out and go home for the day. On my way out the store manager says a very"
good,Very slow at times but its a job that is full of great choices. Work in steady but strong surrounding at each store.
good,Fun enviroment. Great co-workers and a team effort all around. I gained great customer service skills from this job.
good,Have to keep up with sales goal. Always getting new staff. the hours are not too bad.
good,"There is no typical day in retail. Each day is full of a form of mystery as many people pass thru the store. I've learned to study human behavior more than I ever had to. Knowing the different gesture, & movement helps in doing my job effectively & properly."
good,I have enjoyed my jobs. I work hard and have been very flexible in the hours I work. Don't feel that I have a chance for promotion. I enjoy my customers (they are the best) and my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the standing on your feet all day.
good,Great compensation. I worked here and loved it and was paid greatly. The store closing was very tough for me. I met lifelong friends here as ex coworkers as well as customers
good,Working at Dillard's requires a strong will to be a sales person. Each day requires you to step away from your comfort zone and approach potential customers. Each employee is judged based on performance. If you are seeking employment here make sure you are willing to work hard and are wiling to work Holidays.
good,Worked with customers to suit their needs. Management was okay. I enjoyed helping various customers and my co workers
good,A normal work day here at dillards is greeting every customer and talking and getting to know each individual to help them find the product they want. Your goal is to hit your sph and quota and open credit accounts.
good,Everyday we had to to interact with customers and make sure that every customer have an amzing experience whenever they shop at Dillards. We also had to meet sales quotas and make sure merchandise is correctly priced.
good,I worked as Counter manager and again in Fragrance sales for Dillard's. I now work a few hours a week as a fragrance Vendor within Dillards.
good,Typical day requires follow up calls and sales
good,This is a great place to start working for a first time job. I had the pleasure to meet wonderful people and learn how to interact with customers and build great customer service skills.
good,"With my bright personallity, I really enjoyed while I was working at the store as a sales associate. I loved to see my cutomer being very satisfied with my customer service, I also loved to communicate with customers, it seems not that important, but that is actually help to figure out the customer's need and also provide very friendly environment to the customer."
good,I was able to learn and do as much as I wanted to in the Men's department. They had great training - I worked in each of the different departments in the store before I was assigned to the Men's department. Once in Mens I was eventually given free reign in the young men's area. I was able to determine the placement of merchandise and I created all of the displays. The other areas had planograms to follow. I really enjoyed working in this department.
good,This place is a very stressful place to work and the hours were not for me as a mother.
good,"Great job that always had me on my toes. Great learning experience, good coworkers."
good,"good managment, fun to work because we always had a gift basket to win if someone met a quota or sold the most of an item"
good,work hard and you will succeed.co workers were mostley excelent.
good,The hours were great because I was able to spend time with my family. The work was easy and the co-workers were nice and easy to get along with.
good,Provide excellent customer service to the genral public. Maintain a sales goal. Stock new Merchandise. Stay positive.
good,I loved my customers here. I'm so sad that finely is no longer in Dillard's
good,I had fun creating a wall and display area for my section pay was good and schedule was flexable
good,"Dillard's offers a mostly productive work environment for sales associates to achieve personal sales goals in. Dillard's prides itself over customer relationships, feeling like that is the best way to increase sales. Overall, I feel that a good bunch of emplyees find it dfficult to become totally motivated to complete work."
good,Dillards was definitely a sales driven company. I still had a great time working there. The reason I leftward to go back to school.
good,"A great place to work. Fun and freindly people to work with, but if you not a people person and dnt have good commucation skills this is not the job for you"
good,"I would maintain the stockroom, and show tables on the sales floor. I also sold shoes and worked with the register."
good,"Be ready to clean, display new product, be friendly, able to multi task, put up stock n build a clientele book."
good,"Basically, make sure the sales floor was ready for the day and made sure the racks were full or appeared to be full. Checked the displays and changed them with the newest arrivals. Cleaned out dressing rooms that were missed the day before and rearrange new merchandise that came in. Also assisted customers with their selections and purchases and any other question they might have about our services."
good,Enjoyed strong customer relation.team work.Lot of training in all area from open to closing.
good,Learn about excellent service and tried to go above and beyond with help guest
good,Retail is great for those needing a flexible schedule. Great employee discounts.
good,Great way to learn multiple sales fields in everything from shoes to high end clothing.
good,I enjoyed working as a bank teller. I probably would have enjoyed working as a banker more due to they are more interactive and essentially making the higher rate.
good,The one thing for working for this company you meet alot of friendly people.The upper management is GREAT! The management over each department is horriable.
good,"Seems because of Healthcare some of their benefits are over priced for cost, and I work long 12 hour days sometimes.. but it's all regular time if it's less then 40 hrs/week.. and most weeks.. I can barely get 38.. Overtime is 'frowned' upon."
good,"So far so good. I learned a lot about the skin care and good people to work with, My manager is awesome. She allows me to work at my own hours as long as I meet my goals. So far so good"
good,Dillards was my first retail job experience. They created a professional environment and I loved the job throughout. I got to interact with people I can relate to.
good,"When I was employed, I was told that they didn't cut people like they used to, but when I transferred, they didn't seem to get that memo. I saw high turnover. It all comes down to having the right people, and that includes management."
good,Came in early got task done early and everyone worked together to accomplish this. I had a great management experience while working here . I learned alot about working for a large business.
good,"good working environment, flexibility in learning in different areas,manager willing to work with employees,good benefits and opportunity for advancements."
good,"Working at the mall includes working days, nights, weekends and holidays. Usually customers are nice but sometimes they are not. If you are looking to work at the mall, this is a great job. It's not too hard and it pays well."
good,Dillard's was a fun place to work because you were offered a discount for your purchases. It was easy to get along with others and the work atmosphere was laid back. The one downside was the sales quota.
good,You're in charge of how much or how little you make. Dependent on the  amount of customer visiting the store and more important the department you work in.
good,"If you need a quick job this is a good place to start . Everyone starts at bare minimum wage and they don’t like giving raises . "
good,Good pay for a retail job. Only if you make your sales goal every day.  Its hard when its slow without customers.  Overall a good job with benefits only fulltime associated
good,It was a nice place to work for a while. Good place to work right out of college and go into the training program. Training program is classroom environment.
good,I enjoyed working for this company it was a relaxed  atmosphere the managers were good people I would would work for this company again pay rate should be better
good,"Started in cosmetics and it could be very slow. You Must take the time with each most customer to make sales. Dillards is a number driven company. Make your numbers and you will do well, numbers can be difficult do to customer traffic."
good,"Being promoted twice during my year of employment with the company I soon realized it is quite easy to advance with the company if you are knowledgeable and expendable. I learned how to run 3-5 different departments, work with multiple personalities and train myself on upcoming or current products. I loved all of my coworkers and would have stayed with the company if I had more time to spend with my daughter."
good,Stay to yourself don't get involved with the drama always got something to do putting away clothes can get overwhelming an if your shoes are not comfortable may wanna rethink of what your wearing
good,"- Great starter job out of highschool, great $12.50 an hr payroll to start."
good,"Great work environment with friendly coworkers there to help out with any situation, as well as a management staff available all day to help with client relations or discrepancies."
good,"Sales"
good,"Dillard's is an awesome store for employment only if you are at a high volume store."
good,Fun place to work. Worked with all nationality and race .  Great sales for the employees. The department work with your schedule.   You get to meet a lot of people. The sales was great for the employees.
good,Constant rotation of employees due to high sales quotas. If u are self motivated and goal oriented the sales quotas are not impossible to achieve. Probably one of the highest paying retail jobs in the area.
good,"It was one of the best experience with my new step of direction, it taught me a lot and help add more skills to my portfolio. The company is friendly and has great people. Job is based on sales and numbers."
good,"The workplace culture is very comfortable, managers treat employees like family and also have compassion. Recommend to someone who is looking to move up in the company and is willing to relocate for a higher position."
good,You have to be sure of your ability and able provide service on call.  You need to be the tour guide showing the lay of the lands of sorts. This displays how well you know the store and its offerings.
good,good place to work and plenty of fun times some down time and a lot if fast pace work. good work days discount was good the people are really fun and the hardest part is sometimes the managers
good,"I enjoy sales very much, I seem to have a knack for it. I was very successful at Dillard's and advanced quickly, I was being groomed for store management before I left. I enjoyed it very much!"
good,worked here during school.it was an ok place to work. it paid decent. loved my co workers. very sharkey environment. sales are important. i would not recommend this to a friend.
good,The company is very competitive in sales. I would recommend working here for the reason it is easy work and pays above average. They have a good employee discount.
good,"Management was not great and lacked communication. Understaffed which led to conflicts in schedule. Long hours on feet without a proper break, wouldnt recommend."
good,"It's a commissioned based retail job, so do not expect a nice coworker  at all! you will meet a very few people that will care for others. Everything else is fine (it depends on the department manager)."
good,"A typical work day was fast-paced and consisted of handling stock, assisting customers, and cleaning. The hardest part of the job was the quotas they gave each day."
good,Too much gossip going on. We are suppose to be adults so lets act like it. Minding your own business and concentrating on customers are what we are there for.
good,"It is a hard and competitive work environment. It might not say everything they expect of you, but you will learn quickly. There are people you can trust and people you can't, like any other job, but here you will find out very quickly."
good,the staff is very friendly and the discount if even better.  I learned a lot of human behavior watching people to prevent theft.  we were able to strategically place hot items in an area that was hard to steal form.
good,A tough management company but great opportunities for growth and developing all management skills.  I loved the quick pace and people that I worked with.  Very structured environment.
good,I had to start from scratch but working here has given me the opportunity and the realization to know what I want to do with my life. Great experience!
good,I used to feel like i had job security here but as online shopping has got more and more popular and people have got busier and busier brick and mortar stores are becoming extinct.
good,Long shifts not very flexible with scheduling. Coworkers and problems with management can be draining. Great job for college students looking to make more than minimum wage but not a very permanent job.
good,"Good place to work, on weekends it was pretty busy, not so much during the week. Very cut throat and you have to be very competitive for sales. Great discounts"
good,"The Sales associates make it so difficult for a new workers, they so jealous about somebody else doing great that they are not friendly they just want to make more difficult"
good,"Competitive, worked on commission, required standing for nan long period of time. Merchandise had to be tagged before bringing to the floor. dressings rooms had to be monitored regularly."
good,"I liked working at Dillard's and made friends with my co-workers. I was competitive with sales.My manager was great and responsible. I would have loved to stay, but as a single mother, my child has to be in daycare so I can work."
good,"Working in Dillards was a very good experience for me. Being that I already worked in customer service already for a couple years meeting new people was always the trill for me and Dillards made that happen. The work environment was friendly and capable of getting your work done. Management was good at handling the issues we had whenever they did happen. I say the hardest part about working in Dillards was whenever its the first of the year. Every first of  the year we have an 50 percent off sale on everything, and I must say it can get pretty busy. I've learned during my time at Dillards, but the most important one was to never give up even if your not use to something."
good,"A relaxed atmosphere that can get busy at times. There is a lot of collaboration that must go on between sales staff, managers and security (loss prevention department). However, my overall supervisor - operations manager for the store is kind, understanding, fair and very flexible when it comes to scheduling your hours.The only disappointing thing is Dillard's corporate office sets a salary cap on long-term employees instead of giving them an annual raise. So your income does not really adjust to inflation and cost of living across the country."
good,"The job is more based for those in a younger generation just starting out. Pay is above minimum wage, but the hours never exceed 28 per week. Its a good place to be for high schoolers, or people in college."
good,"Some days would be pretty stressful, like big sales. I learned that sales is about communication and just being able to talk to people...getting to know them. Sales isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Management is different at every store and state....some good, some bad. Like every job there are a groups of people that you just need to stay away from...negativity. The hardest part would be probably trying to keep up with the high quotas. The most enjoyable part would be working as a team, and of course great discounts!"
good,"I made lots of friends while there. Loved the job, didn't like some managers. The discount was awesome and even better during sale time. I miss my days there."
good,"Workload made the job difficult.  Over the years I oversaw no more than 35 employees which included scheduling, reviews, correctives and terminations."
good,I enjoyed this job. Many tasks and duties to make the day go by. Incentives for getting the trucks unloaded quickly. I enjoyed getting to see the new merchandise.
good,"It's definitely a competitive atmosphere, and every store is run somewhat different because store managers are given freedom to run the business the way they see fit. My boss gave us a lot of freedom and was fairly hands-off, while a neighboring store was the complete opposite. That SM was very hands-on and micromanaged even the smallest daily activities."
good,"stocking"
good,It was a great experience. The benefits were very useful and it was used almost every week. I learned how to go towards people when it came to letting them know how deals and getting customers to sign up for the dillard's card.
good,"Dillards is one of the best retail jobs that I had when it comes to pay. The overall management is okay. Hours are like any retail, nights, holidays and weekends."
good,"This job gave me the opportunity to discover my abilities and the chance to advance in other departments. Gave me the in-site on how to endure my ability and to find my passion toward serving and create that relationship with the customers, for their needs."
good,"i worked for around 9 months. First few months went well. since we were only 2 sales associates in one department. But later they hired around 4 or 5 more people. Which effected the sales and goals that we needed to make. But i likes the pay and the benefits. (Huge discounts on high end brands). The only part that was completely unfair and disappointing, when i resigned from the job and put my 2 weeks in. the manager next day told me my performance wasnt upto the expectation and i was only allowed to complete 1 week. They got my signature and promised me i would be able to complete my 2 weeks. But they lied. They do not follow their own policies."
good,"i worked in the shipping department when i was there. it was a tough job at first, but once you get the hang of things it is more enjoyable and very rewarding."
good,I enjoy working at Dillard's. It has been great. I have worked with some great people. I enjoy working with customers and the other associates. You can have good days and bad days as with any job.
good,It would be a better place to work if the job was full time . Very relaxed environment. Very respectful and respectable environment. Nice co-workers . Everybody helps each other
good,"Great place to get your career started and to gain management experience. It is defiantly a family friendly place to work, probably the best retailer to join."
good,I learned from this workplace is to read all reviews before you sign your name and submit your application to a job. Management were rude and rarely speak.
good,"I worked in two different departments while I was working there.  The first one, I sold furniture and we were commission based.  My co-workers would do anything to get a sale even if it meant they had to steal one from another sales associate.  The next department I worked in was Ladies Shoes and it also was commission based.  Working there was even worse than the Furniture Dept.  Very cut-throat environment."
good,This particular Dillard's was managed well. It was fast paced with a lot of foot traffic. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. The only negative things are you must meet your sales quota or your pay could be decreased and you have to sell their credit cards.
good,"Selling shoes"
good,"I enjoy retail sales and being around people.  Dillards had a daily sales quota which was hard to meet especially when you had long time employees there that thought every customer that walked in was theirs.  When I worked by myself I did great.  When I had to work with others they felt like all I should do is keep the changing rooms cleaned.  I know that's part of the job, but hard to meet that sales quota when working with others."
good,"Customer Service could get hectic at times if not scheduled enough people. When slow it gets very boring, even when not being able to go any where but the small area we have up stairs. Might not be for everyone. Management could be rude at times when you need help, but other then acting like they forgot, it's pretty easy sailing from there."
good,"A typical day at Dillards is not your typical place in another Department Store. Dillard's has it's own culture with it's very loyal clientele. I was directly responsible for assisting clients with purchases, handling large sums or money and inventory control."
good,Dillard's holds their employees to a SPH (sales per hour) system. I totally disagree with this because good employees who are hardworking can be fired due to not enough sales. The company feels like they have to blame someone. I was amazing at my job my manager cried when she had to fire me. I wasn't fired for my work ethic I was fired dude to having to meet $3000 in sales a day to keep my job.
good,"It is hard to be on your feet that long in dress shoes and being highly active.  I enjoyed the competitive nature and to do your best selling. I bought a lot of products from Dillard's.  Pans, dishes, and clothes were a big sale and what I bought.  I would send anyone there for the great bedding."
good,Working for Dillard's was a big change for me from the field I was used to and no less working in the hair salon. It was rocky when I first started out but at the end of the day I love all the lady's there they are absolutely phenomenal to work with. I learned so much working at the front desk that I thought I was  stylist at one point.
good,Had some amazing coworkers. Most of management is amazing! It's fun to work in a place you also shop. Discounts!!!! Love to go back and visit. It was like a little family.
good,"Mostly opening, getting ready for guests learned a lot about retail and its procedure, some good managers, ok workplace culture, hardest part trying every day to make sales with very few customers and  knowing the I had to perform an specific amount of sales per hour SPH to stay with the company, but I really enjoy my time there"
good,"This is another travel job. It started out with my working in my home town, then the travel kicked in. My job was to go to whichever Dillard's store I was assigned to. Hire local Manpower temp help to complete re-lamping of their entire store."
good,"The experiance for customer service was good. However, having previously been in a management position, I noticed the management structure wasn't solid. Extreamly fluid and prone to a clickish mentality. Some of the corporate leadership was of the same mentality. The higher level management was very helpful in everything. The store environment was very competitive."
good,"I had the opportunity to learn how to solder and clean sterling silver jewelry to meet the James Avery specifications. I kept trying to improve my technique with each piece I soldered onto the charm bracelets.  I had other tasks to do in addition to managing the James Avery jewelry.  I liked working with my manager. She was very hands-on in her department as well as knowledgeable.  The most enjoyable part of my job was listening to the emotional stories of how long James Avery jewelry has been a part of the customers lives. Also, working with seasoned professionals was an extreme joy, everyone was team oriented in my department."
good,"I liked working here, competitive sales. Only problem is that at the time I was working here I didn't have a reliable source of transportation. Had to quit  to find a closer job."
good,"Staying aware of the surroundings was important because of issues with merchandise being stolen was important. Being knowledgeable with merchandise was the key for sales and adding accessories was a plus. Understanding staging of products with the designer's flow was important. Knowing how to ring merchandise adding discounts and offering other items near the register was important with upselling."
good,"Working at dillards is a great experience. The pay is great, a lot of my associates are amazing, healthcare and benefits are good, Its just to sales based, everyone fights over sales to keep their jobs"
good,"Reviewing sales from the day before, looking at staffing for the day and setting goals to achieve a sales increase. Good work place, very competitive, pushing for sales daily. I interview people daily, coach and train. The hardest part of the job is to keep the sales increase, The most enjoyable part is seeing people I hired get promoted."
good,Good company overall to work for.  Shows diversity in employees.  Easy to work with for work schedule. Excellent employee discount program.  Clean stores.
good,"It was a cool warehouse environment. Typical management. People were cool and very friendly. Work hard, have fun, make decent money."
good,"Working in cosmetics was a fun job, helping customers find the right products for them and making them feel good about themselves was very rewarding."
good,"Dillard's was a great job! To the task, the customers, the bonuses. BUT managment could be a lot better. Most of my coworkers have left over the years due to poor managment. The head manager uses his title to bully"
good,Dillards in a whole can be a fun fast paced workplace with great department and store management. Although I worked there for over 3 years with no promotions and no increase in pay. They have a sales quota that is specific to each department. You are required to meet this goal no matter the current volume of customers. They blame the associate on not making there quota even when theres physically no customer traffic in the store. Dillard's does not advertise but once a year for christmas. Dillard's has a fantastic store with great deals. On any given day they have numerous brands and items on sale just not everyone knows about them.
good,Dillard's is a great store with lots of promotions to entice customers.  I sold shoes on a commission basis and found it a very competitive sometime stressful job due to pressure to meet sales goals -- if you did not meet your goals two months in a row you were terminated.  I was always able to exceed my goals but it was very difficult in the slower months of the year... Feb and July come to mind.  The commission was good and made it worth your while.
good,"I love the fact that I could make a customer smile while we found clothes that served their purpose. It was a great experience I've met some great people that I still see from time to time. I also had a great relationship with my co-workers. It was challenging at times because we had to sell so much per hour and it made the job a little stressful at times. However, I loved what I did and to have happy customers made it worth my time there at Dillards."
good,pays very well but requires you to meet personal sales goals that are  unrealistic. cares only for the money you make them and not much about the costumer service as well as your personal health . schedules dont make since most of the time as well. one thing i do enjoy is some of my coworkers
good,"Needs to support Associates in Client Service Model, More training in Dillards and utilize individuals talents to achieve store and individual goals."
good,"We would always have a morning meeting for about 5 minutes advising everyone of what new contest, sales and or other upcoming events in the store that day, what our store goal was for the day and open the store would be next. I've learned to never forget that at the end of the day were are all a team despite what dept you are from. we all have some little job/ part in making the train successfully getting to its destination and in order for that to happen we all have to do our part an work together not against each other. The hardest part was keeping everyone in a positive state of mind.  The most enjoyable part of my job as a manger, team mate, and sales person. Having a customer leave happy with not only the service they were given,or the small little change you made in their life and how that could have such an impact or everlasting impression. to make them feel so welcomed and want to revisit the store."
good,"This was a job I easily advanced in. However it wasn't my first job and certainly not my first in the retail world. As far as compensation, they are willing to pay you an enticing salary, but you are expected to earn that salary. You have individual sales goals you MUST achieve otherwise they will not keep you around."
good,"Because of their pay per/hr sales base, it can be a difficult ""shark tank"" place to work, but overall loved my job and had a great immediate floors supervisor/manager. Their benefits are a little high, but still available if you work full time. Definately hardest part of the job was markdowns and displays when you aren't on the floor getting sales"
good,Dillard's supplies med-top quality products for the general public. The scheduling was not as flexible as I would have liked but the management was hardworking and tried to accommodate. The accessories department was always short staffed which made it hard to cover such a large area. The best part of working for this company was helping customers make educated and fashion forward decisions for their wardrobes.
good,"Dillard's is a great place to work. It has good opportunities for advancement and they have paid vacations. However, there is little training provided which is frustrating and the sales expectations are very high."
good,this place will work you very hard. they do pay well but they ask a lot out of you for that pay. i was offered a manger position for less money. that doesn't make much scene.
good,"Enjoyed Working at Dillards,"
good,Worked in men's shirts and ties department.  Learned that you had to be very patient with some customers as some had difficulty making decisions.  Management was always available but were very nice.  Co-workers were very nice.  Hardest part of job could be the hours.  I really enjoyed meeting and working with the public.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Dillard's especially my coworkers. It was a friendly, fun, and caring environment. Management needs to have better communications with their empolyees."
good,"Great pay, great advancement opportunities, but poor work/life balance."
good,great co workers the customers are great. The clients are the best and make the job most enjoyable. great quality lines.
good,"The manager helped me get into the field I love. He believed in my talent and took a chance with me. In doing so, I found the career I have wanted. It was difficult in the sense that there was only one visual for the entire two floor store, but I absolutely loved it. They gave me freedom to be creative and that made my days of working there something I will treasure."
good,Enjoyed meeting the wide variety of people.  Learning the cosmetic and fragrance industries was interesting and beneficial to selling as well as personal knowledge of what was trending and a good product.
good,"Drive daily sales for department"
good,"easy to advance if you let management know you are interested and can prove yourself"
good,"Wide variety of responsibilities for management, including department sales goals, store sales goals, training of associates, high-level of customer service expected as well as maintaining a clean merchandised floor. Individual plus team environment. Mostly good co-workers."
good,"the most hardest part was leaving my coworkers, We are the hardest working employees they had working in killeen tx. I learned a lot from them when i first started."
good,"I had a hard time with this job.  When customers needed help this is a position that people need extra individual time with. When I had a sale it was big, but it took a lot of time. The company focused a lot of  time on sales instead of customer service.  If you didn't make your quota for the month you lost your job. I couldn't be a good customer service representative and keep my job."
good,"Inventory control, talked to management about daily specks, stock inventory, handled cash, assisted customers in finding product the needed or calling other stores if it was not found in the store."
good,"Helped the customers and maintained the area organized and appealing.  The work environment was nice and I enjoyed interacting with different kind of people.  Developed a better understanding of the apparel industry. "
good,"Dillard's is not a bad place to work, but because of the hours they are opened it is difficult to have a life outside of the work place.  I am a single parent and I have to use my lunch break everyday to go and pick my son up from school.  They rarely schedule your off days together and I often work at least 7 days in a row before I get a day off."
good,It's a good job. it's moderately laid back with it's busy days. it mostly consists of unloading trucks and preparing merchandise as well as keeping the floor clear and some lite housekeeping.
good,I worked in the ladies shoe department. It was very competitive for customers.  The shoe department was a commissioned area. I learned how to be persuasive. The hardest part of the job was taking multiple returns on items  I sold.
good,"Dillard's was a great company to work for everyone was very laid back.  I really liked it when New Years Day would roll around we would have to work (I know what your thinking why would that be a good thing) we would get paid time and half and we could pick another day to be off WITH PAY.  I only left because I moved to Decatur,  Texas."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and would like to get back into this kind of work environment.
good,"I somewhat enjoyed this job it was just hard to reach the sales goals they required you to meet. I worked well with all my managers and co-workers and learned the basics of selling. The most enjoyable part of his job was working with the customers, the hardest part of the job was selling."
good,"-Love being at work"
good,Great place to work. Opportunities are okay. I think its the highest paid department store. Great benefits
good,I enjoyed what I did and where I worked. Management seemed a bit unprofessional at times and made some days harder than others. Coworkers tend to be lazy at times so it felt like the majority of the work fell on more people than it should have been. Communication with customers made the job enjoyable.
good,The pay is great but the pressure your put under to make sale and credit goals is not.
good,I didn't like that you don't get breaks here other than that things are ok.
good,"Flexible, great pay, but it was very slow so difficult to make sales goals."
good,"I enjoy working at the store however, I the hours are minimal and all weekends are required."
good,"A typical day for me was to do stock in the morning, then working on my sales throughout the day. I learned a lot during my time here. Iv'e learned of different managements, a good sales ethic, and a way of better showing my confidence. The co-workers were great but the hardest part of the job was to actually make the sph. The most enjoyable part are the co-workers."
good,Make what you can of it while you are there. The atmosphere is decent with OK clientele.
good,One of the best paying retail stores.  If you apply yourself you can make good money.  If you don't apply yourself the turnover will be quick.
good,Sales and merchandising in large retail department store. Being on the Las Vegas Strip every day was fun and exciting. I learned how to greet people in many different languages because of the very diverse workforce. Co workers fun but very competitive. Inconsistent schedule hardest part. Meeting so many interesting people was the best part.
good,"Taking care of customers"
good,In my opinion I would recommend this job to others. I am presently employed at this company and I am happy to say I thank God I  have a Job.
good,I did most of the work under my own guideance. I learned good organizational skills. My dock manager was great at his job overall. Co-workers were great. It was a great experience overall.
good,fun to meet people.learn a lot of new and old merchandise.people you work with can be challenging since we work for a sells quota. hardest part of the job may be getting customers to come in an purchase.the most enjoyable was you pretty much work at your on pace.
good,fun people you know what you are going to be doing everyday work  good management team will to work with you on time off.
good,My typical day at work was slow. Weekends and holiday were a little busier. I sold perfume but it seems like I did more cleaning and organizing than anything. My co workers and managers were pretty laid back and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was meeting sales goals and most enjoyable part of my job was helping people choose fragrances.
good,"A typical day at work was all about sales and customer service and competing with other retailers. I learned product knowledge, and the retail business in the cosmetic industry. Management  I realized how much pressure they were under with competing company's for sales and advertising. My co workers I absolutely loved, we all backed one another and watched out for one another in our sales. For me the hardest part of the job were the hours as I was raising small children at the time. My enjoyable most part of my job were the people I worked with and our regular customers, whom we became friends with."
good,"Our managers allowed us to work on our own pace, collect our own sales and manage our designated cubicle. "
good,Come in open registers and start the day. If there is stock we open stock and put it in place. Management is new so we are all learning together. My co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part of the job is the sph(sales per hour) if there aren't any customers purchasing products it hurts our productivity and lazy co-workers. I enjoy going in and talking with my customers when they do come in the store.
good,"Great job, fast paced commission atmosphere, inspires you to work hard"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job-helping customers. All my co-workers were very friendly and helpful people.
good,Due to SPH this make Dillard's a very competitive environment. You have the chance to work one on one with customers to help them find what they want.
good,"Assisting customers make purchases by recommending, describing and demonstrating products. I also use cash registers to ring up transactions, which involve using barcode scanners, calculators and credit card machines. When not assisting customers, I arrange product displays; stock shelves and take product inventory.  I Enjoyed the interaction and team work of my co-workers and the management support on daily basis."
good,"a typical day at work is pretty good. if you are good at taking initiatives and lead on your own. Management depends, I guess it is okay. The hardest part of the job to maintain and keep the items that never sells ( items on sale that attracts a lot of ppl) tidy all the time. the most enjoyable part of the job is making the sale goals."
good,"A typical day was to get my book full of my cliental, and perform whatever hair service they requested. I loved my co-workers, and wish the job was a job that was stable."
good,"Dillards is a great company to advance with, however retail hours isn't something that suited myself and my my family."
good,Good pay but you definitely could lose it if your sales are not kept up.
good,"- Customer service, Five star service"
good,best part about dillards is digging deep into your department numbers and building relationships with buyers.
good,"to load and unload trucks when needed, and to do genaeral clean when neccessary"
good,Out of Business- great money and family business. Integretiy is the highest youll find with the owners.
good,I genuinely enjoyed working for Dillards. Most of my coworkers were friendly and good people. The only real complaint I had was that it seemed like a lot of people who did their jobs well got fired and a lot of people who didn't do their jobs well stayed on staff which did not make sense to me. BUT I was also not a manager so I don't know the reasoning behind all of that. Other than that I really loved it there and miss all my coworkers!
good,Job security is the only thing thats a downfall of Dillard's. Loved the weekly and hourly pay.
good,"I enjoyed my days working at Dillards and meeting various people each day. A typical day would be to assist customers with selection items for special events and arranging the stock rooms in the proper order. Dillards has a great selection of product and they carry items usually carried in high-end stores at a price reduction. Management was great by providing proper training to help employees become the best. The hardest part of the job was having to prepare for our big promotional events and cleaning up afterwards. You have to be extremely organized and great with customer service to meet your sales requirements. Co-workers that do not follow guidelines are what also make the job harder, leaving others to clean up behind them. Overall, the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer and making them happy by providing excellent customer service."
good,"Dillard's is always trying to be more up to date with teaching sales. Coaching and Mentoring was a big aspect of the management position. Management training and some management is a little lax. The best part of the position was the employee and clients and the relationships that were built. The hardest part of the job was was wearing many hats, the longer hours expected upon management and not being recognized or compensated for the dedicated time and effort."
good,"Dillard's was a temporary solution for my employment at the time because I was in the process of making my way back to my family. Overall, my experience with Dillard's was positive. I did enjoy the opportunity to work in the cash office, gaining exposure to the procedures of daily deposits and balancing."
good,Always meeting people. Great environment. Lots of beautiful items.
good,"Dillard's is a great place to work, you meet fun people everyday. It's exciting working and displaying merchandise.I've worked in retail for twenty years and I love providing excellent customer service. I love working with colors and my co-workers were great."
good,"Overall---I rate Dillard's average company to work for. I enjoyed working with clients and my cowrokers. I have met many new friends while working for this company. I enjoyed doing the visuals for the department and doing the markdowns and meeting new people. The hardest part of this job was selling as we (the store) did not have a lot of customer traffic. Management was always courteous and fair with me,as I certainly was to them aways."
good,* Worked with the public each day
good,Working in retail is a much harder job than it appears. Meeting sales quotas can be hard. Customers can be rude. Very physically demanding position.
good,"I love the people I work with, the only problem is that the management encourage an extremely competitive environment that makes it stressful to work in."
good,I enjoyed working there. I really enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"enjoyed working with costemers, plenty of hours fun place to work"
good,I love the job although sometimes the Sales Driven atmosphere can get very aggressive. Your pay raises are determined by your quota and your quota only. I thourouly enjoy visuals and merchandising as well as talking with customers and meeting there needs.
good,"Hours of operation 9 to 9 Monday thru Saturday and 12 -6 Sunday's, a typical day would be checking all current sales and updating signs, reviewing historical sales figures and moving and placement of furniture. Hardest part of my job is handling ALL customer issues from all the sales staff and attending to their needs. I did enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when customers walked away satisfied with their furniture purchases. Retail hours are generally long and although they compensate you better than most retailers you are expected to preform according to their expectations as far as sales is concerned. And as a Selling Business Manager I was expected to sell more than my associates and outsell them as well."
good,"selling.meeting quota, love my coworkers ,i learned how to help people with all their needs"
good,Learned many lessons about people and business skills. Great starter company.
good,Good job to have while in school. Being on your feet all day is very tiring. The management wasn't all that good but my co-workers and customers is what made me come back to work every day. They had good benefits as well
good,"Not much to. The schedules don’t really rotate so you don’t have time for your family. It’s easy money but some management can make it miserable."
good,"A day at work, consistence in customer sale,The hardest of the job was trying to find out what the staff really wanted out of the worker. No matter how hard you worked, And give great customer,Someone always had a negative complaint . But i still enjoyed working there and learning something new each day. The most enjoyable part of the job was sale,s. And meeting new customer each day. Some customer made my day worth being on that job.Some customer enjoyed buying as well as i enjoyed selling the items to them. At the end we both enjoyed the process at Dillard,s. sale, was the best part of the day. Wish i could find another store like like Dillard,s."
good,Great place to work employee's discounts I enjoyed interacting with the customers and having a good customer employee relationship with some of the customers.
good,"The people with whom I worked were fun and engaging, as well as super familial. They certainly made the every, ho-hum aspect(s) of work much more entertaining and enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed working here. I was supported by Management. Sales quotas are the hardest especially in todays world of on-line shopping. The most enjoyable part of the job was our customers.
good,Enjoyable job that works closely with management and Law enforcement to prevent theft in the store. The only down side would be sitting in the camera room the whole day almost waiting for something to happen.
good,Dillards has a great work atmosphere  I really enjoyed my time of being employed there  staff was very professional and assisted new employees like myself in learning how to approach and provide great customer service
good,"If I could have worked here 10 years earlier I could have made a nice living.  Good management, classy atmosphere, nice coworkers, but the pay declines as retail declines.  too bad."
good,"Management is terrible, but the associates were great. The sales goals are completely unrealistic and if you don’t meet the goal the will terminate you after 3 months"
good,"When working here I had a great group of coworkers! The manager are okay, some are good and some aren't. The customers are the ones you have to watch out for they are some of the rudest people I have ever met."
good,Dillard's is a good solid brick and mortar to work for.  Stock options are there. Taking time off depends on other managers/supervisors schedules.  Seniority takes priority for time off.  Management  satisfaction varies by location.  The most difficult part is the competitive sales skills and long hours on your feet.  The most enjoyable is the discounts and team appreciation events.
good,"At Dillard you are one one  with the customers you learn about fashion and different brands. The management at Dillards was great. The dress code is very strict."
good,"I actually really liked dillards , i was pregnant the whole time i worked there ,  but they give you as many hours as you need , and very communicative and organized."
good,"Slow to start with, Gradually got busier, Much nicer variety of merchandise.People seemed genuinly glad to be at work Hardest part of the job was the days we got stock in.We did not seem to have enough r00m to put the sock away."
good,"I enjoy working here.  It is a very relaxing environment and our customers, for the most part, are the best.  I wish I started here when I was young.  Thank you for the experience."
good,Dillard's is a great retail opportunity. Dillard's offers a liveable wage. They also have a great employee discount program. Dillard's also gives you your birthday off with pay.
good,"AS Business Manager, my role was to insure the team had their goals, all visual was set properly and caselines set to standard. I was also responsible for my own sales goals, which I met and exceeded regularly. I also set up events with vendors, store events with customers, etc."
good,"I expected the worse there cause I read online how ex employees felt. I was surprised that where I worked, I got along with almost everyone and employees there helped me out with advice. My manager was stern but fair and helpful. I liked the scheduling but felt we could have gotten out earlier than 6:30 pm , but I was told it was to help with sales."
good,"I love dillards. I felt that the pay was fair, the job I had isn't stressful. The benefits are nice. You can start a 401K even if you are part time. I'd recommend it to anyone"
good,"- A typical day is pretty busy, taking calls and helping customers"
good,great place to work good people. management could be better with associates and there could be more hours and flexibility. great environment and discounts but not enough respect for associates or customers.
good,"A typical day at work putting up inventory, working with customers."
good,Pleasant work environment.  Coworkers are fun to work with and help where needed.  Learning about retail.  Work/life balance needs work.  The best part of the job is helping the customers.
good,In the department I worked I got along with most coworkers very well. the store was slow paced  so it was competitive when guest would come in.  had to push cards on every guest. i loved working with the merchandise and meeting new people.
good,Dillards pays its employees well compared to several other retail jobs. Unfortunately they have a very high turnover rate due to exceptionally high sales goals
good,"Depending on the shift, I would either open or close a register. Throughout my day, I would greet customers and have a casual conversation with. Then I would try to get them in a seat to give them a skin care treatment on their face and/or do a makeover on them. The goal was to show products to the customers so they would be interested in buying them. Alot of times I would have customers who knew what they wanted already, so I would just get the products and ring them up on the register."
good,"I like how busy the job keeps you and being able to learn more and more about the different product that we Carry. Quotas are the worst, sometimes impossible to even make because they are so ridiculously high, but other than that the people that shop there are pretty friendly and very dedicated and I love it. Seeing new faces become regular faces that become our friends is definitely something to look forward to everyday."
good,I love the job. The customers are great and easy to get along with. The company itself is a great company and I enjoy selling to my customers on a daily basis and finding out what it is that brought them into the store.
good,"Dillard's a blissful and competitive place to be employed. In a struggling time for retail, Dillard's remained steadfast in its approach to the ever changing market. Adapting and overcoming challenges faster than the fashion allows. With feedback from store level through executive managers, company goals were met through product awareness and excitement among team members. A competitive yet rewarding selling environment to fuel the profitability of the company as well as the income of employment."
good,"Sale and explain and show customers new products how they look how they smell,did makeovers. Learned all about 5 different Brands of cosmectics,had classes and meetings about the "
good,"managers are accessible, great open door policy. Open and close register, sort new inventory, pull markdowns and place in sale area for department, sort new merchandise, hardest was being in high heels all shift. most enjoyable being able to interact with customers and help them find what they wanted."
good,"Working at Dillards is just fine. However Dillards has quota, the same as other Stores, you need to work hard to meet that quota otherwise your going to have a paycut"
good,Good job with good people as well as management. Very competitive due to it be a commission store. The hardest part of the job is trying to make a sale after the holidays.
good,"This job should have been just for the Christmas season, but it lasted longer than I expected. I then moved looking for a place where the rent and the pay scale were better aligned."
good,"In the Children's department, it was pretty slow.  When there weren't any customers, we had to clean/tidy the department which never had to be done b/c we kept our area neat.  If you didn't meet your sales quota, you could be looking at a deduction in pay.  Most days it was hard to meet because there weren't enough customers."
good,"The company moves qualified candidates up fast. Really all depends on relationships, not skill unfortunately. Management changes frequent sometime things get lost in translation."
good,"I loved this job but over time it became very stressful. You have to work really hard to keep your pay and a lot of times business can be slow so you don't always make numbers. Then comes the competing for sales, its like a shark tank. You have to have a good customer base. Other then that is could be a great job if the eliminated you getting pay cuts not not making sales quota."
good,"Never a dull moment, you can be yourself, learn, grow, and teach. Dillards is the kind of company where you come to work, do your job, mix, mingle, and create. I've always had a thing for fashion so it fits me and my personality, you have to find what fits you."
good,Dillards was a good part time job that helped round off the hours.  I really felt that things were pretty good with the hours and timing around my main job at Teleflex.
good,"Dillard's was good job, great people and management was ok most of the time. Working there was not for the weak hearted , its a SALES job your a number not a person. Dillard's is a cutthroat work Environment!!!"
good,"A typical day at Belk is challenging with most customers being rude."
good,"I loved working for Dillards. They pay well for the amount of workload. The commission gets scary at times. You HAVE to meet your sales goals, otherwise you risk your job over time. I made some wonderful relationships, and gained customer appreciation at this job. I would work there again."
good,Great job. There's opportunity there for those who push towards it. Managers place very high demand on their employees who are dealing with the remnants of a dying consumer culture.
good,i loved dillards but with different rules and mangers things got out of hand dillards was a fun place to work but i needed a new start and i hated how mangers made up rules be real
good,"Management seems to remain in high stress, which rolls down to other department managers. Highly competitive environment and you are expected to surpass daily sales objectives, in some cases, higher than is reasonable."
good,I worked in fine and retail Jewelry in sales. I also rotated to all other departments when needed. I loved working with different people and the mall has a great atmosphere.
good,Through out my time working at Dillard's I learned many job skills that will help me with making decisions in the future. The work environment was friendly and welcoming.
good,"Working at Dillard's was sufficient.  I was able for the most part to keep my schedule flexible to be able to take care of my child, as I was a single mother at the time.  The benefits and the perks of the job were great as well.  The management at this location was adequate, although their communication between each other and the staff could improve some.  Overall, this is a good place to find employment, as you have the possibility to advance your career here if you so choose."
good,"-good starting pay"
good,Its a fast pace environment. If you are shy and quiet I do not recommend. You stress too much about meeting daily sales goals and maintaining good sales reviews. If you are not a good sales person they will give you the boot.
good,Great place to work when in Retail... Good Management and Focus on Customer Service. Ability to move up in a more lateral way. Helpful and fun people to work around.
good,"Raised are given due to making sales quote's which is fare, but returns are counted against us, and we're often short handed. So if you work on a didn't work area is also counted aginist you. I don't think scheduling is fare."
good,"Overall I really liked the coworkers I worked and the environment I was given but something seemed off about my role and position at Dillard's so I put in my 2 weeks. If I got the opportunity to work their again, I would do it because I loved my job and the customers I meet everyday."
good,"Working in retail is very stressful.  Long hours, weekends and some nights.  You are constantly checking the numbers.  If your individual business is not turning a profit, you could lose your job at any moment. The fear of losing your job or being demoted could happen at any moment."
good,This job is quite enjoyable and can have flexible hours but management can be a big issue. Many times I would do multiple jobs not in my job description due to management's poor planning and scheduling. I was always expected to get work done at the same speed and output when put in other roles and in different regions of the store. Many managers here place highly unrealistic sales goals and expectations which causes stress for plenty of employees. I fixed this by opening up and building a bridge of communication with management but other employees weren't as comfortable doing this and become overworked.
good,"Dillard's pays well and they love to promote from inside the store, so there are options to move up. Fun environment to work in, and great employee discount. Just watch out, there is a quota system, so be prepared to be very competitive."
good,Very good place to work if you like to work with people. Dillards is all about customer service and helping others. Very competitive for you to get a raise.
good,"This job would have been extremely great if management had a lot more training as well as sales reps.  Very eventful place to work.  Enjoyed all the new launches from clothing, fragrances and shoes as well along with home appliances."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Competition between workers for sales can be a bit stressful.Departments work towards a goal, in addition you have to meet a sales goal. So it is a goal oriented job."
good,Dillard's is surviving in a tough market.  Decisions on management level employees are often made from afar without full knowledge of the local situation.
good,"Dillards is a great place to work if you like being on your feet and constantly talking to people. The weekly pay is great, but just be prepared for working holidays, ""snakes"" in the work place who try to take your sales, but also some really nice people. Commission is a plus, but making your sales goal is probably the hardest part of the job. Overall, more positives then negatives. I would work there again."
good,"All I can say is it is very competitive and one has to meet one's goal. There are a lot of vultures there and you have to be strong to get to where you want to go and develop a really thick skin. As for the management,  they are a set of nice people. They are the kind of people that you can meet and talk to. My mentor is a nice lady that has put me through how to go about my work and make it easy for me."
good,"Enjoyed working here overall , discounts are great, just need to make daily quota. Business attire uniform. Management is very nice , they have their off days, overall very nice and understanding people"
good,Exciting to learn how to apply makeup and skincare products.             I was proud to have increased sales significantly. I got to meet all types of people because the counter i worked at was in the mall.
good,Always fun and challenging to work in a fast paced sales environment where your success depends on you!  Highly competitive and must meet daily sales quotas.
good,a normal work day depending on what department you worked in was always productive and it could be stressful if you were behind on doing freight or your area wasn't properly in its place.
good,The sales associates are friendly but sometimes they can be a little pushy. They have great brands and there store sales make it affordable. I got a great commission rate and had days were I made quite a bit of money because of the commission.
good,Great company to work for. Very much expects results and as long as you achieve then you are fine and if you aren't well then you are in trouble. I had three different supervisors in five years. Two where bad one was great. The great supervisor made the job a fantastic year. The other years where rough.
good,Dillards is a good place to work for and you have good job security and great pay. hard to advance in. they do have medical for full time employees and  401k
good,"I meet new customers everyday. Some of them became good friends. I learnt a lot about American culture, met people of different origin, learnt about old and new brands in the market, spending nature of people, merchandising, visual merchandising, improved my sales skills, professional language and personal grooming."
good,Left only due to schedule problem during the time i was still raising my kids. The discounts and sales were nice especially have to clothes my kids. They weren't able to work with me on a schedule around my kids spring break
good,Setting up products for that day to sell and cleaning up dept for displays. Learned to how to sell fragrances. Management was satisfactory overall. The culture was very friendly.
good,A typical work day consisted of working with a variety of customers and organizational responsibilities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with the customers and building a relationship.
good,The only thing I really didn't like was the fact that our returns hurt us so much. Love the people i worked with and my manager was one the best in my opinion.....
good,"A typical day consist of stocking merchandise, and assisting with customer sales. I learned how to complete customer service sales. The hardest part of the job was I was working full time at High Plains Radiology and almost full time at Dillard's. The most enjoyable part of the day was assisting customers"
good,Lots of different departments to work in and gain sales experience . Lots of opportunity to move up in the company . Always keeps you busy and pays decently
good,"Working at Dillard's has given me a lot of experience working in customer service. I have been able to be myself with customers and co-workers. The hardest thing working in retail is being on my feet all day, organizing and marking down items, because then I come home and have to clean up after a toddler. Management isn't the strongest here at Dillard's but other than that I really have enjoyed working here."
good,"I like it here, but it's not a forever place and quotas are high and you are punished if you don't meet them... "
good,"Great work environment, good pay with good benefits."
good,"Go work to and sale!!! A day at Dillard's would be going to work, work on stock, and greet all customers. The hardest part about the job is making a sale. The most enjoyable part about the job would be meeting new people."
good,"Meet new people everyday, make friends within the work place. Help customers throughout your department. Managers are willing to work with regarding schedules or emergencies. Just have fun."
good,Put away new merchandise. Helped others with their task. Helped customers. Management was pretty okay. Watch the people from the home office come thru the store and never have any complaints.
good,"Everything is handed down from the ""big Boss""! Nothing gets done without prior approval from corporate offices, which leaves little room for creativity and personal style. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my co-workers and loved the location."
good,"In my short experience working with Dillard's the only thing that I discover is that they don't care for their employees. All they wanted to have them do is sale and sale did not matter that there was no customers around, they wanted for the employees to somehow appear sales. They gave too high of a quota and had far too many people working in the same area to be able to have them all have a significant portion of the quota done, and they would only make you stress about it, and they are always firing and hiring people."
good,"Working hours run so fast, always busy "
good,"The average starting pay is decent. I loved meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with tasks on sale days. Things would get pretty hectic and it was sometimes hard to focus on your quota, cleaning, putting out new merchandise, and keeping up good customer service. Especially when you had the department to yourself."
good,Enjoyed the people and customers I work and came in contact with. The joy of working and helping the customers that I encountered was just unimaginable!
good,"a typical day at work would be loading trailers with a pallet jack full of product"
good,"Productive, fast paced work environment with a lot of learning opportunities for anyone new in the retail line of business, great experience and real helpful in mastering organizational skills."
good,"it was a good part time job for extra cash during the holidays"
good,Great learning and working experience in sales and customer service with daily goals and milestones. Making connections and good selling points to push merchandise into the hands of clinets is an every day intent.
good,"Let me start off by saying the people are great. Pay is awesome, benefits are also, and i'm saying the free stuff. Other than that, it is ok. And remember if you do decide to work here, you can and will be replaced and they will let you know that."
good,Great place to work with great co workers however management needs  a little work and organization. I have learned a lot about sales and how to speak to approach customers.
good,"I tried to keep the workstations full.  If I kept a moderate amount of work on everyone's line,  it was a good day.  The management was effective at communicating changes in process or vendor problems."
good,"I really enjoy the customer relationships developed while working at Dillard's. The management has been a great group to work for. They are always helpful and willing to work with you to help accomplish a task. It can become very challenging with learning new system updates without the proper training. It can also be difficult when under staffed and needing to multi-task between customers and retail responsibilities. However, the multi-tasking is what I like because it keeps me busy and helps me maintain my energetic attitude."
good,"Working for Dillards was a dream come true. I was able to show my good customer service skills in a good environment, and learn different skills that would help me in the future."
good,"Enjoyable work place with supportive team members and management. Daily quota and team goals met , but also focus on developing as an associate into becoming a specialist in an certain area."
good,"Quiet, formal environment. I enjoyed helping and interacting with customers, assisting with purchases etc.. Hardest part of the job was folding and refolding items and restocking."
good,the management  there don't look after there employees they sit up in there office and when its time for a store visit then they come out to help you but when you need help with a matter and call them on it they don't response it needs to get better there  turn around is very bad cant keep good employees that are good at tier work
good,"Every day there is a new and exciting way to get thru the day with this company! Floor work, dressing rooms, cleaning, trucks, even sales."
good,They don't mind giving raises. They even start you off with a decent wage. They don't mind overtime. Your birthday is considered an holiday and you are paid time nd a half. With all these good things mentioned nine of it matters when management sucks.
good,A typical day consisted of managing 3-5 staff members and 25-30 kids. I taught them how to swim one hour every day. I organized educational field trips for the children and projects related toward swimming.
good,"I am a sales associate in the Home department of Dillard's. My department is rather unpredictable to work in. Most of the time it is slow-paced, but there are times where the pace picks up. Even when things get fast-paced, nonetheless, the environment remains nice to work in."
good,Dillard's was a great job for me at the time. It provided everything that I needed. I would go back. I espescially enjoyed the Tailored clothing department.
good,"I opened the salon on a regular basis, i would get everything ready for the day for all the customers.  Throughout the day I greeted all customers and answered all phone calls.  Checked all customers out and made reminder call for next day appointments."
good,Dillard's is a very fun job to interact with others and help people out. I enjoy working with the associates there everyone is very friendly. Management is ok I feel like they can do a better job. The hardest part of the job is reaching your quota on a very slow day and you have a really high quota to reach besides that everything is great!
good,"Would have rather had department sales goals.  Saw several very"
good,"Lots of pluses when working at Dillard's, starting pay is higher than most comparable jobs, lots of job growth available.  The negative is that each employee has an hourly quota, and this can lead to a very competitive work environment, especially during seasonal slumps."
good,"Learned about different between brand names for clothes.."
good,"Dillard's cosmetic department is a productive environment to work in. Working in cosmetics has taught me the importance of relationship building with clients. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to help women feel beautiful. I have also learned the importance of teamwork. During certain times of the year, particularly special events, the department has large numbers we need to accomplish. This would not be possible without everyone working together and giving each other constant support."
good,Very conservative and serious. Hands on with customers. Was motivated to take on many leadership roles.
good,Dillards is a very fun work environment and the staff is amazing. The benefits are very good and selling the most important priority. Also they sell the best product anybody can buy at reasonable prices.
good,"a typical day working at dillards department store was fun, it always was something to do around the store as well as there as always a good  number of customers to assist daily, Management was also great people to be around instead of feeling like you were pins and needles'. My fellow co workers all knew me and also as a team we helped each other out during high volumes with customers, the hardest part of working with this company was markdowns and inventory due to the department store being so big, and last but not least the most enjoyable part about this job was the fashion and customers who needed assistance with finding what they wanted to purchase."
good,They pay very well but the quota for some departments are almost impossible to reach on certain days of the week. The store manager had his days but he has a disconnect with how to treat employees with respect including some of his managers. I did like the job its not bad if you are in school. They can be flexible at times.
good,"Dillard's was a great experience.  Loved taking care of the customers for the most part.  People ""customers"" are good and bad but being able to provide excellent customer service is an art especially to the bad customers who have forgotten their manners.  Management was usually young kids who were not always capable of handling ""power"" or people.  The requirement was to be professional and proactive in producing high volume sales and positive customer relationships.  Really learned how to handle a tough job.  Not worked retail or been a cashier? Become one and see that it is not for the weak.   That is where you learn or not learn customer service. Great team mindset when you are a good team member.  Loved shopping with the discounts.  Dillard's keep doing what you are good at, evaluate the managers often (secret shoppers are best) and encourage your hard workers."
good,"Crazy"
good,"Worked with customers daily"
good,"Dillards pays very well, and they hire often, but it's because people are always being let go or quitting. The management is pretty uncaring and tend to make up rules as they go. The scheduling is erratic, and they promise advancement but it never comes, even after months of exceeding sales goals and awesome work ethic."
good,Days vary with business. I have learned a new job function within the company. Management works hard and will reward store for job well done.
good,"I would work a normal 40 hrs a week in 8 hour shifts. Sometimes I  would have to open and close 2 registers while working as the only sales consultant on the floor. My manager in charge of my department was very understanding, motivating, and pleasing to be around. As far as higher management I felt they were less understanding. The most challenging task i dealt with had to be fussy customers, I always stayed calm and patient, calling a manager to the scene if needed. I would have to say that overall I enjoyed everything that the job entailed especially making people fell comfortable in they're own shoes."
good,Working at Dillard's was fine.  The only set back is the sales quota.  They offer employees benefits and a great employee discount.
good,I worked here while pursuing a degree in college and it was perfect!!! Made great friends and really liked helping people! Great hours and never too late!
good,I learned a lot working here through some of their training programs.  Always had some type of event planned as to boost employee moral. Management and employees work well.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining sales quotas.
good,"A typical day at work was great."
good,"working at dillards is grear for a part time job, The pay is good plus they give you commision and discount on their products"
good,"very quick paced on the dock."
good,"Check all fragrances be sure everything is neat, check all make up counters clean brushes, restock whatever needs to be restocked. Say hello to all employees around me, greet customers, sell fragrances and make up. Give make overs. Call my clients from Dillard's to inform them of any sales we have going on or good deals, also about new products."
good,the most enjoyable part of the day was helping out people find what they wanted but didn't know how. It was fun finding the right fashion pieces to meet their needs.
good,"Providing customer service, Excellent customer service experience, Huge turn over, Very competitive."
good,Most days were very busy.  Worked first in upper level clothing then advanced to cosmetics.  Management was very helpful and willing to assist you.  Co-workers were easy to work with.  The hardest part of retail are the slow periods that come along but there is always something to be taken care of during the day.  The most enjoyable part of the days are the customers - even grumpy customers.
good,"Typical day requires tasks - markdowns, merchandising floors, sales goaling associates, recruiting, training videos."
good,"open, hang, tag, and distribute merchandise. prepare merchandise for shipping to stores."
good,"Dillard's was a great opportunity for me. They were wonderful to me  and really gave me an opportunity to grow and advance within the organization. I spent several years with them in a sales capacity and a sales manager capacity. I learned how to manage many people, which I tend to gravitate towards a leadership role anyways. I enjoyed working there very much and had the best co-workers. The hardest part of the job really was dealing with difficult employee issues. More to the point employees who were not willing to go with the flow and be responsible. I don't like having to reprimand or terminate employees but I did so as necessary; however I did find it challenging. I very much enjoyed the teamwork that I experienced there. Everyone was always willing to help each other all the time. Someone was always pitching in to do he best job possible."
good,"a typical day at work consists of customers and shipment. i learned how to multitask at a fast but productive pace. management could be more efficient and less reliant on associates to cover/pick up slack. depends on the manager. some are good some need training. i worked in 6 different locations at the request of district manager. i had 1 great manager, 2 good managers and the others i wasn't clear if they were fit to do all job requirements. co-workers are great as long as you maintain a professional and friendly environment as with any job. the hardest part of the job was physically with unloading shipment, tagging, marketing, helping customers, maintaining tidiness all at the same time, with only 2 associates or by your self. the most enjoyable part was being a part and up to date with fashion, customer interaction, and always learning something new."
good,"Learned alot about women's shoes; peep toe, strappy sandle, ankle strap, ballet flat, etc. I enjoyed keeping the stockroom in order, it made life easier, but my co-workers didn't feel the same way."
good,I worked in the office when I was in this position and also processed glass claims and took pictures of properties to be insured.  I would not have left except that I moved out of town.
good,A typical day at work consisted of standing in the fragrance department helping guests decide which fragrance to buy.  I learned the many types of scents that are used in perfume and how they react to the skin.  I also learned how to professionally gift wrap boxes for special occasions.  Management was a bit impersonal and more concerned with sales than employees.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make my sales per hour during slow seasons.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take home free bottles of perfume during training sessions.
good,The enjoyable part is meeting customers from different walks of life
good,"Working at Dillard's, you must rely heavily on selling skills, product knowledge, and customer service. This workplace is very goal and performance oriented and may at times be discouraging. You must be diligent to sell especially with co-workers in your department with the same mindset. You must remain ethical in your selling as well by honoring a return and resell of a shoe made by another associate or other circumstances. Overall, it is a friendly yet competitive environment with an emphasis on policy and standards which I personally respect about the company and its management."
good,"my manager was the best! she would do everything in her power to help you,she would keep in touch woth her co-workers and made it fun work place,i did learn a lot from her and how to approch customer and make a sale."
good,"Worked here for over a year. LOVED my manager and all upper management. However, the particular Dillard's I worked for had a very low traffic volume, thus sales were usually down."
good,"The workers and management staff are great, but sometimes the people from the corporate office limit what workers and their management can to do bring in customers. It is a fast paced retail store chain that demands a lot of dedication and determination to get the stores where they should be at. It is not a hard company to advance in if you are dedicated and a hard worker."
good,I obtained this job when I was in college and soccer season was not in session. I worked in the men's department and worked part time. I was asked by my manager if I had an interest in loss prevention due to me being observant and detaining several individuals attempting to remove store merchandise from the store without paying for them. I was unable to accept that position due to it being a full time position.
good,"Dillard's is a great place, Co-workers are easy to get along with but they promise you so much like only closing two days out of the week, one weekend off each month, being able to get days off when needed for family events, doctors' appointments with no hassle but they do indeed hassle and question everything. Management is not what is expected, they try to get everyone to fear them, if you don't fit into their crowd or their idea of perfect they pick on you or even have you do all the dirty work. That was the hardest part trying to please them. I love working with my customers and over looked the way they treat people because in the end, the customers matter the most. I enjoy my co workers and customers because we engaged and felt that satisfactory when i helped them discover a new look or fragrance."
good,Work starts with a managment meeting by store manager.We review what is the goal for today.we then break up into separate deparments where all department managers hold there own sales rally.We work on training throughout the day and best practices on how to best care for the clients.We get into merchandising and markdowns then signings and visual .There is nothing hard about the job other than sometimes our Personell need lots of motivation which can be different for each person.Merchandising and motivating are the most rewarding parts.
good,I created a schedule for the employees I had under me and managing them. I learned how to create an efficient work schedule. The management helped me to learn the correct way to manage employees. The hardest part was creating an efficient schedule for all the cashiers and customer service reps. The most enjoyable part was to be of assistance to all customers and creating a family based environment.
good,"I liked working for Dillards but with the way the economy was and has been. The sales was touch to make happen to get my quotas. For the most part I did well. Well, until I was switched to a different part of the store as I had worked in the Mens Dept and was doing well until I was switched to the Women Dept."
good,"If you're not competitive don't work here this is a high sales job, but if that's your type of thing and you have high energy and love clothes this is the place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Clinique/Lauder. The hours are hard because it's retail but that's to be expected. My co-workers were great and we developed close relationships. Management was management dollar driven,if you can't handle pressure about sales and making more money this job is not for you. Neither is retail because itis dollar driven! Period!!!"
good,"Although Dillard's has great benefits and pay, the hours are long and so what tiresome. Retail is not for everyone and should be explored more if one desire."
good,Good work environment
good,I liked working here because the associates were very helpful and I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,I worked in the home section and my job was on the sales floor and overall I liked the area i worked in and the people i worked with. I did not like that the emphasis was on individual sales as opposed to overall store sales.
good,"This was my very first job and I was extremely nervous coming in. My coworkers started helping me immediately, showing me how to initiate an and engage in a conversation with customers, showing me how to open/close a register along with how to work it, where everything belonged, and making sure I didn't feel rushed, needing to learn faster than I could. "
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers in my department. I enjoy the trendy fashion changes every season, and I enjoy meeting and retaining great relationships with my customers."
good,"Loved working for dillards. Very encouraging environment. Really understands work life balance. I felt important and valued. Closed on Thanksgiving, which most big retailers don't do anymore."
good,"A typical day in customer service would be me counting money to open registers, then I would take car of any customers that come in that want cash refunds or returns etc. Managment was great it was the hours they had me working I wasnt great with I have a son and I would come home late every day. Overall the job was great the customer service ladies were great and helpful."
good,I worked at the clearance store which pays less than a regular dillards but you do not have to meet sales requirements. It was a lot more relaxed while still being fast paced. My only complaint is that they only let you have 28 hours a week
good,"I enjoyed too much working at Dillard's because sale and people are my passion. I met a lot of people of different culture and countries like costumers and employees."
good,"Better than most places. Laid back work type environment. Flexible work schedules, request for vacations are usually approved, works well with military schedules as well."
good,The management and staff are helpful and care about the customers.  They are very knowledgeable in the department they oversee. Employees are given a generous company discount.
good,You have to maintain a quota and you start part-time. Most of the time you are cleaning up and trying to find a sale. Its fun however its retail and you will work weekends
good,"Dillards was a cool job. It was very fast paced working in customer service, especially around holidays, but all in all, it was fun. The pay is great. Management was amazing."
good,I enjoyed working there but it was very stressful and high maintenance. I sold perfume and cologne in the cosmetic department. Very time consuming and very competitive. The daily quotas rollover to the next shift and so on and so forth. Very stressful. The General Manager was extremely difficult to work with and listen to. But everyone else was amazing.
good,"A typical day at work starts by getting your work area ready for opening. Each associate who are assigned in different departments are required to do mark downs and receive new merchandise. Associates are required to ensure show cases are displayed with new merchandise. Management is polite to staff members. Most of the staff is nice. To me the hardest part of the job is working long hours on their major sales day, January 1st.  I do like meeting with the guests, letting them know what we have to offer and helping them to choose the right product and know that at the end of the transaction they are truly satisfied."
good,"Great staff, great Managers but they need to get rid of the SPH. Not realistic. Good pay. Great shopping deals. Overall better quality of merchandise compared to other big stores."
good,fun job to work at. getting to meet new people and help them make decisions. the company also offered me opportunities to grow with them. totally recommend.
good,The workplace culture is a formal  business atmosphere.  Employees dress for work in business attire.  This culture has taught many employees to take pride in their appearance and has positively affected their confidence and self worth.
good,Dillards warehouse is made up of several diffrent departments rhat all vary in roles that potentially ban  together for a good work day. Do your job an you will be good
good,"A typical day for me was organization, recruiting customers, following up with recent and previous customers. Demonstrations, marketing and sales. I learned how to recruit, customer service, and sales. Management was great, it was a little like college a lot of competition. Executing sale goals and reprimanding employees. I loved the benefits, free items, and travel."
good,"Unloading and loading trucks,take trash off floors,clean bathrooms,run trash compacter,vacuum sales floor,and help others. I learned to run varnisher to clean marble floors. Being asked to get multiple things done asap. The people you work with are a team."
good,Dillards is a great place to interact with your customers and really get to know them on a professional level. You start to gain loyal repeat customers who trust you to help them find the best products for their style. You get to work with great people in a fun and vibrant atmosphere. Everyone is very helpful and and very friendly. Hours and pay are great. Eligible to earn discounts and gratis. Allowed to have tattoos and colored hair. Highly recommend working here.
good,"It was a good experience. It shined a light on my sense of taste, and integrating it very much. I learned some history of some famous people and the inspiration"
good,"I worked at Dillard’s for 10 years, and only left for medical reasons. The pay was great and management was nice. The only downside was having a lot of down time. There is an emphasis on selling, so most of your time is spent standing around waiting for customers to help."
good,I have enjoyed working with Dillard's. They have been very good to me and have worked well with my schedule so that I could finish college and now graduate school. It is a very diverse and culture friendly environment with opportunity for growth.
good,"Dillard's is amazing. This is a good part time job, with opportunity to advance to full time. You get along and find common interests with all employees and staff."
good,I have worked there for a little over a year. The people who work there are really cool. The job can be high stress but the pay is good. There is opportunity to move up as long as you are close with the upper management.
good,"In the two years, I worked for Dillard's I was stressed out. I loved the fact that they paid every week. My son died the first year that I worked there they told me to take all the time I needed off so I still had a job when I was able to return. I did get good raises I started at $9.00 ended with $12.70. That was really good money but most of it went back to Dillard's because the depression shopping took over."
good,I enjoyed my time there. I was able to learn a lot about fragrances and beauty tips. They treat their employees fairly and do a lot of promoting from with in. The general manager of the store was a fantastic guy who Ifelt a very fair man. Most of the managers were easy to work with.
good,It was a great work experience while I was there I learned how to run the cash register. I also ran fitting rooms where there were up to ten idems the customer could Tae in at a time. I got a lot of credit apps during the time i was there and I enjoyed helping people.
good,"Your career is what you make it at Dillard's. It is a very entrepreneurial environment.  Leaders are given quite a bit of latitude in executing their business plans.  Regional Managers, the President and Corporate Executives are responsive to requests and new ideas to grow business."
good,"Monitor store with 28 cameras for shoplifters and other issues as assigned. Detain suspects for police and attend court trials to testify. Complete daily, weekly and monthly reports and paper work. Complete paper work for all detained suspects and record all suspects to a CD for evidence."
good,"I really loved working at Dillard's, I hardly had obnoxious customers and I only had two co-workers that I didn't entirely get along with (which is impressive, as we could have up to sixteen people on the floor in our department at a time).  But, if you are not aggressive about sales, they will let you go.  "
good,"My job consist of one on one costumer service. Sale quotes to meet every week was probably the hardest during the slowest time of year. I worked in the Jr. section, so I was always up to date with the latest fashions to assure costumers was satisfied."
good,I am legally blind and they were reasonable in their accommodations. They let me have the hours that fit my transportation needs. Management was very understanding.
good,"Passionate about fashion, love to learn, excellent communication skills using active listening techniques thereby making the correct sale and decreasing sale returns, and a desire to be the best. Participated in the ongoing product and sales training, met and exceeded monthly sales goals evidenced by continued pay raises."
good,"You have to be sales driven. They are not hiring someone to stand at a register, they are looking for someone to sell. You have to maintain sales goals or else it is easy to be fired."
good,I worked in multiple departments throughput my duration at Dillard's. I learned a lot in all areas and even more about business ethics and customer service.
good,"Nice work environment.. Great management staff. Employees are helpful and enjoy working together as a team. In some areas, there is opportunity to earn commission. Also, receive employee discounts on regular as sale merchandise."
good,Its a ok place to work. The pay is descent. You do have sales goals that have to be met or your pay will start to drop until it gets to $11.00 per hour after that you will be let go if your numbers don't go up.
good,"Should have more and better training for Customer Service Reps."
good,"being better than most of the jobs I have had Dillards allowed me to learn management roles and duties without having to jump headlong into the post they always had something going on to help their employees learn more about the product they have to sell. "
good,"I worked with a great bunch of people at Dillard's, some of which I do regard as family. The job taught me about how to provide customer service and to work as a team."
good,"best pay I have ever received working retail but as a single mother, working mandatory nights, weekends, and holidays, just did not work for me. The sales associates do it all. Markdowns, stock, cashier, answering phones, placing orders through online system, and so much more."
good,Fine-tuned my sales skills while working at Dillard's especially after relocating to Miami where I was faced with helping customers that spoke a different language. I learned to adapt and did well.
good,Good customer service was important for this job a typical day of work required you to make at lest 2000 dollars worth of sales each day. This means I needed to make 158 dollars an hour. The hardest part was the completion I had with my other employees making these sales. I learned the value of teamwork and advertising products. I enjoyed being a cashier.
good,"Dillard's is a good company but you must be dedicated to it. During the holidays, you are required to work long hours and be prepared to work 6 days a week. The management was great however the quotas were often unreasonable."
good,"A typical day at work was, counting the register in the morning and cleaning up the sales floor. Ringing customers up throughout the day. I learned a lot about the work place, such as how to deal with customer situations. Management was okay, sometimes selfish. The hardest part of the job was Saturdays. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I work with."
good,Dillard's had taught me good leadership skills and a way to work with people. The hardest is with nursing school and the hours. It pays well and helps with bills. Needing something willing to work with my school schedule and clinicals
good,"associates work together but also fight over customers dont meet yours sales quota your salary may be cut "
good,"One of the biggest challenges would be working in the shoe department of Dillard's. Many customers who visit this department are established and will often return to their preferred sales representative. I had transferred to this department from another and going from one department that everyone would work together to this department and seeing employees working against each other, being upset about someone stealing a sale, high turnover with new employees,  was just very difficult to really focus on getting the job done. Sometimes the department would be over staffed making it difficult at times to obtain commissions."
good,Its typically very slow not any volume during the week. The fragrance counter was not the busiest in the Cosmetics department. Unfair management and constant micromanagement. Mainly employed by older employees most younger people don't stay long. Hardest part of the job is getting people to apply for credit cards considering Dillard's only has the Credit option available. Most enjoyable part of job was lunch or meeting new customers.
good,"a typical day included of making sales helping customers, straightening out the sales floor and stock room and counting the draw if you close for the day."
good,"The holidays were pretty stressful, but other than that everything was fine. Pretty competitive when it comes to other employees, but nothing too extreme."
good,"A typical day would include Cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming, unlocking all entrances, usually go over whats going on at dock meeting in morning, unload trucks if available, sort hangers, distribute handbags to retail associates, assist employees needed."
good,"They start out with a great pay, but it can be very stressful at times, as most high-end retail stores. They expect quite a bit more from people without giving an adequate training. You really just have to learn from the people around you. The sale numbers an associate is expected to make can be unattainable."
good,Great place to work if you are serious about working!  Most positions have the opportunity for growth and pay increase. You are an important part of the team.
good,Friendly co-workers. Friendly Manager. The tasks held within the job were simple and easy to follow. Customers were normally easy to help and deal with. The job itself was good and provided decent benefits.
good,Dillards is a great company to work for. The company has great management and benefits. Dillards has really provided great training and skills needed to work. My most enjoyable part of my job was customer service.
good,If you are up to fighting with other associates to make an insanely high quota then this is your place. The people are very nice and the discount is wonderful. The quotas are very unattainable.
good,"Enjoyable, quick-paced environment.  Any job is what YOU make of it...I enjoy Dillard's.  The tools to be successful are readily available if one takes the time to use them.  I recommend Dillard's as a great part-time job.  "
good,"The job is basically direct costumer services, helping people to find the product they are looking for. You also organize display shoes and new arrivals as well as keep everything organized in the stock room and on the floor."
good,I enjoyed getting to know my co-workers and appreciated the management above me. Work/Life balance was terrible much like any other retail position. Compensation was good.
good,The staff was pretty good to work for. Very helpful with any questions you may have and understanding with a few mistakes. Would have loved to have stayed on with the company.
good,"Trying to meet your draw for the day could be tough based on when you worked. My coworkers were amazing and always competitive, so it made the job a lot more fun."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dillards. I miss it. They were very laid back, at lest my job was. The guys on the floor might think differently though. Management was good for my job. They could be a bit picky to those on the floor but other than that they were great."
good,Dillard's is a good work place if you're looking for a place with advancement opportunities and a competitive environment. Management is over all good with a few exceptions but you will find that at pretty much any place. Hardest part of the job is trying to meet your daily quota for sales and convincing customers to sign up for Dillard's credit cards. The best part about the job is all the mini competitions they hold each month. They make it so you know your hard work is being appreciated.
good,Dillard's provides a hand on training program for Assistant Buyers. As an Assistant you work under a Buyer to learn the essential job duties of working in apparel procurement.
good,"This is a good company to work for, the best part of the job is watching your sales associate meet and exceed sales goals. Typical day would involve normal day to business of any retail store. There would also be time for teaching and training associates daily on sales techniques and following up with the area managers to make sure the store is properly merchandised and that the store stays up to date on fashion trends."
good,"Working in the women's shoe department at Dillard's has been tough, fast-paced work. My co-workers are amazing and management is okay. I enjoy working with many different people and helping customers find what they're looking for. I love the work I do but I find that the scheduling constraints do not work with my lifestyle. I love performing in and helping out with community theatre. Unfortunately the majority of what happens in the theatre is in the evenings and this job does not allow me to participate in what I love."
good,"A typical day is filled with constant inventory movement and rearranging all while trying to be available for customers who need one on one attention. Sales quota is hard to meet unless you are hunting for customers all day. Despite these things, it is a fun place to work once you learn the tricks of the trade. Highly recommend working here if you want to gain experience in sales. Management is all about giving raises to people who work hard and advancement is encouraged and supported."
good,"I was an Intern at Dillard's for three months. I learned a lot about visual merchandising from the visual merchandise manager. I enjoyed being in all of the departments of the store. I wish I had learned more about the management side. Most of the people were friendly, but being an Intern there was a lot of drama that I was always hearing about. There were many people that were older than me that I worked with, which was okay. Management needs a little improvement. The internship wasn't that structured and organized, I wish they had more for me to do. Dillard's, as a whole needs a big face lift in order to get more people in their store! One of my favorite parts of working was being in the accessories department and being in charge of the service desk. Overall, I am happy that I was able to learn a lot about visual merchandising, being in all of the departments, and meeting the people there!!"
good,Employees dont work together as a team. Instead they look out for each by taking others sales. Management is very passive with this issue and constantly demands high quotas from each employee.
good,"Great and fast place to work and great team work."
good,"DILLARDS  Corporation is a well established Retailer."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's , is pretty slow paced but theres always something for you to do to keep you busy. While there I picked ups a few things that I didn't know before working there. As in price adjusting , wedding registry , how to order things online , and so on. The management there were helpful , and as for the workplace culture id say laid back."
good,"Nice place to work, self supervision, co-workers very helpful, management open to help employees balance work and family."
good,I do not really have any negative to say about this company except hard work is not being noticed for those who work very well and put a lot of effort to be recognize
good,"Everyone is assigned to a department and there are some departments that are very slow. I would rearrange items when we received new merchandise, straighten up, and try to reach my quota. I became good friends with next dept. manager so I could always ask for help if needed.  I enjoyed selling luggage  to customers while was not a big fan of kitchenware especially if looking who it was made by."
good,"Unrealistic, near impossible sales goals and an extremly high turnover rate of approx. 6 months on average. Workplace culture is very fun, coworkers were by far the best I've has so far."
good,"The job itself was fun, however, management needs a lot of help.  Though I have to say this is an issue I have faced with any and all retail I have worked. Overall not a bad environment, with excellent starting pay."
good,"Cleaned and prepared the store to open, unloaded merchandise from the trucks everyday. Unpacked boxes, hung up clothing and took to the floor in there proper areas."
good,"It's a competitive work environment. Everyone is nice and friendly. The pay is good and they have an employee appreciation day every month. I enjoyed my time everyday i was their. If you don't keep your sales up, then they are not afraid to find a replacement."
good,As I work at Dillard's I made sure all the customers were happy making sure that everything was also organized working behind of the cash register. Helped me develope good customer service skills.
good,Slow paced store. More recruiting than hands on service/sales. Supportive management overall. Company will not advertise or use social media to expand business. Stores appearance is out dated and falling behind in current trends.
good,A great company to learn and grow within the organization.  The company provided me with many opportunities for growth during my employment.
good,It's a great place to work if you can handle a very competitive work place. the management is very positive and motivated. the work is good but stressfull.
good,"Very productive, energetic, positive work environment, the managers teach and motivate you to meet all goals. very competitive work environment."
good,"A typical day at work was very relax and enjoyable, where you learn with every guest something new, with a great team  to work and the management  team always open to listen and help with any situation around.  The hardest part of the job was so many hour in you're feet, about the most enjoyable part of the job I can said the costumer interaction and the relax environment"
good,"•	Achieved and exceeded all set goals while providing outstanding customer service"
good,A day of me working at dillards in the fragrances and cosmetics department would all be about making our customers our priority. I would help them find a fragrance that they like or if they know what they want just give it to them. If it was in the cosmetics part i would help them find what they were looking for and if it was for like a foundation i would color match them.
good,I enjoyed working with new customers and assisting them in finding what they needed on a day to day basis. I also loved the employee discounts.
good,It is a good paying job that works with your school hours. But you must know you have to work hard and sale your products in order to meet your daily or weekly job to keep working for Dillards.
good,"great place to work and move up, lose amount you make if store standards are not met, great employees all levels, everyone can grow with this company"
good,Offers good benefits and job stability. Fun environment at times. Management could be better. Long term employees can be rude and territorial. Some favoritism between management and employees. Good job to have temporally.
good,it's not a bad job. gives you the opportunity to move up. can get quite stressful.management was okay not great not terrible.  fair flexible schedules.making sales is a huge part.
good,"Open up drawer with cash, organize the cash by demoniation, then coins, check drawer for any check, log into computer proceed with Greeting the Customers, suggesting selling of current and upcoming items.  Looking through data base to locate an catalog key items for frequent customers and dropping them a card or two in mail or email info about upcoming events.  I started at Dillard's as a Makeup Artist for Top line, 5 years in cosmetics and last three years in Women's Apparel, etc. Co-workers enjoyed my help and suggestions for improving their sales. Pleasing the customers when i was off the came back just for me, when i moved to clothing all customers followed me up stairs as well, still came for cosmetic recommendations."
good,"I love working with people, and the customers at Dillard's are very precious. There is always a lot of work to do keeping the sales floor stocked and organized. Co-workers are very friendly and supportive and I learned how to work closely with them on the sales floor, preferring each other rather than competing for sales. The hardest part of the job was trying to work with the dept manager who had very poor people skills, often being dishonest and disrespectful to the sales associates working for her."
good,"There was always something to do. I worked in men and ladies shoes, and i loved it. The only thing i didnt like about dillards was the management. All of the managers were very rude, and even customers would complain about how mean and rude they were. I liked always having something to do."
good,"Fun work place with driven management, There was always something new and different to do.  Very fast based environment. Competitive amongst the district."
good,"Fun workplace, supportive management, but it still could be a little stressful. Having a monthly quota, that really didn't change much, can really stress you out when you're not having much business. Most enjoyable part of the job was.Having customers come in looking for a certain style for a party, dance, or special occasion, and being able to find them exactly hat they were looking for, instead of having to settle for something that as close. Hardest part, would have to be trying to hit your monthly numbers. hen the store was practically empty."
good,"great work environment with helpful managers"
good,"Merchandise coordinator for the state of Ohio"
good,"Nice place to work at. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. No voice is un-heard, everyone gets to make suggestions. Big on teamwork and effort."
good,Good company to work for if you are a good sales man. Compensation is alright but not that great. There is a big gap among management in communication and delegation.
good,"Very good place to work, I established  a good relation ship with all of my clients, the majority of them were returning clients."
good,Every day starts out with getting stock done or any tasks that need to be done before opening time. Providing excellent customer service while maintaining the store's appearance is first and foremost then making your daily goal and store goal. Co-workers get along with one another 90% of the time. Management is usually great to work with. Hardest part of the job is not getting paid enough for doing more than what you should be doing. Most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and the customers.
good,I really liked working for Dillard's.  The employee discounts was great.  I just couldn't afford to stay in Texas and had to come back home where I got a better job
good,"Worked in the Juniors department. We were required to meet a quota in number of transactions processed.  During evaluations I was given a raise for meeting or exceeding my quota. I was offered a position in the beauty department, which was considered top of the pyramid because of my turn over. I cleaned out fitting rooms, changed the mannequins to match the prospering season. I've placed orders for certain merchandise requested and addresses product to be sent to other stores. Took part in inventory. Restocked and reorganized merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work was very structured.  I picked my students up from the media center in the morning where they were working on a math or reading program on the computers with one of my paras. We would go to the room and go over the day's schedule,  begin a morning assignment, then line up for special area.  The rest of the day would be spent doing morning meeting,  reading, math, science...in whole and small groups, lunch, recess, and dismissal. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with the kids and seeing them light up when they learned something, or hearing them laugh when they are joking around.  The hardest part was dealing with an ongoing discipline issue with a student with no support from Administration."
good,I enjoyed learning how to interact with customers on a personal level and allowing them to become comfortable with me. Customers trusted my opinion and description of merchandise that they were intending on purchasing. The environment was highly professional and competitive especially when every associate on the sales floor has to meet their sales quota for the day. Overall Dillard's was great employment for me.
good,it was fun and i felt like the ladies there was a family.they really opened up and showed me the ropes.i didnt like the hours or weekends so i had to leave top take care of my daughter plus having to do a qutoe wasnt fun
good,The work environment is outstanding.  Management Teams work collaboratively and are very focused on their business strategy.  The teams that I have worked with were willing to look at a new way of doing things if it would positively impact business goals.  Work life balance is an area of improvement for them.
good,"Starting pay is excellent. For many warehouse/production/factory jobs in this area, you start out pretty good. This is a retail/pseudo-sales job, and starts you out at more or less the same. If you're doing well, they put you at full time and raise you up even better with pay!"
good,"It was great working in the Cosmetics Dept. Always fun! Loved my coworkers at the other counters. Didn't like the stress of meeting a sales quota, otherwise, great coworkers! Awesome customers."
good,good equipment and co-workers to work with; commissioned sales was unreasonable for $100 per hour expected for weekdays.
good,"It's a good place if you really know how to approach customers and sell. Since we work by quota you are constantly under pressure to make your sales goals, besides that it is pretty awesome place to work."
good,"I liked Dillard's, nice co-workers. An okay work environment. Had a daily quota to meet. Managers were friendly and helpful enough."
good,"Typically you spend the day organizing your section and pursuing customers to make sales. I learned how to match my section to floor plans, or make up my own floor plan in order to make newly acquired merchandise pop out so customers can purchase them easier. The managers were extremely friendly with staff and customers. Never once were any managers sitting around watching you work, they always had something to do.They would stop what they were doing and help you or a customer at any time when necessary. My co-workers were very hard workers and helped me and others organize their sections on days where sales were slow. The hardest part of the job was trying to reach your quota during slow periods of the week. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with co-workers and telling jokes with the manager."
good,"* Very busy."
good,They should not make the women wear heels all day it is dangerous and harmful to our feet. As long as your shoe covers your ankles that should be all that matters. Great place to  move up if you know how to sell.
good,"Scheduling employees.  I learned how to work with the public as well with others.  Management was very careful and cared about posting upcoming positions so that all that were qualified and interested could apply.  Co-workers were wonderful low turn over rate could not ask for a better group of people to help manage, teach and work with.  The hardest part of the job was scheduling a lot of the people dd have full time jobs and were using retail as a supplemental income.  Scheduling was not easy at times working around other peoples schedules.  Working with my co-workers as well as the public.  I like working with other people."
good,"Always had something to do. The company and the people made it worth going in everyday. The hardest part of the job was being able to sell new products to customers at the time they came in, they always wanted to wait to do it later."
good,I loved my co workers and felt that the upper management was accessible. Learning was available and promotion encouraged.  I felt appreciated and supported.
good,"I TRUELY ENJOY WORKING AT DILLARD'S, Assosciate are friendly and customers are luck of the draw, but a positive attitude truly makes the difference in how people will respond to you. Left a second job h expectations to become full time 4 months later i am still part-time. As a single parent with a toddler, Health insurance would really come in handy."
good,"Gave workers plenty of free meals, great first job to have and plenty of chances for investment."
good,The job is great. You meet awesome co workers and great customers. the most enjoyable is when there are events for different cosmetic counters and everyone is interacting with customers and getting the job done as well. the only thing is that the hours can be rough on a person with a family or other obligations.
good,"It's a great environment at work, I have no complains because everyday i learn something new. If it is not from a manager, it is from a coworker or from a customer. most of the time, the customers are so much fun to work with. Making jokes with a customer while helping them make them feel more at ease, and trust you more with their expenses."
good,This job was very fun to work but quotas were sometimes hard to reach depending upon the season.  I enjoyed learning about the merchandise though and do miss this job sometimes.
good,Dillards is a great place to work at only if you are working in a store with friendly management. The pay rate is good and there's a lot to learn too but unnecessary stress given to workers decrease their productivity and they have to focus their energy on lesser important matters
good,the sales goals are tricky. but i love the people. the work is easy.
good,"I've already reviewed Dillard's. A typical day at Dillard's mainly sales, sales, and more sales. Dillard's operate on a Sales Per Hour goal which could be upward $200 per hour. I can say that Dillard's has the best training program I've had the pleasure of receiving. As a Sales Business Manager/Tailored Specialist, Dillard's gave me training like no other place I've ever worked. I was sent to train under some of the best Business Managers in the business and there were regular training seminars from vendors that kept you updated on the newest changes in product. Product knowledge is very important to Dillard's which is why your Sales Per Hour goals can be so high. A good working relationship can exist among co-workers but everyone is sometimes stressed out over sales goals. Which makes the hardest part of the job ""meeting sales goals"" and because of that Dillard's has a rapid turn around rate."
good,Very much the same as Hills but the compensation was poor! I started on the floor in men's tailored clothing and was shortly promoted to area sales manager. I should have stayed as a commissioned sales associate as that position paid more than the management position I accepted. ( given the amount of hours I was required to work )
good,"Multi-tasking is the best description of a typical work day. As a counter manager, I'm responsible for leading and coaching a team to produce maximum revenue daily, monthly and annually. Meeting new people and building client relationships is the most rewarding and most enjoyable part of my job. My clients are the number one priority and exceeding their needs to provide the best customer service is my goal and my team's goal every day. Other duties include scheduling, visual merchandising, stock/inventory organizing and managing, as well as maintaining an organized, clean, and visually appealing cosmetic counter. The most challenging part of my job is planning, implementing and executing events and promotions quarterly/semi-annually; however, the successes that follow are also rewarding and beneficial to the team and company."
good,"Dillards was growing their online presence while I was with them.  Typical work day included resolving issues as they were reported throughout our environment and interfacing with the various teams to gain an understanding of their needs."
good,"fun atmosphere, well paid for retail. scheduling can be problematic it wasn't for me."
good,"My typical day at work would be to count registers, greet and interact with customers on sales floor. Provide them with information on any new merchandise or sales. Neatly organize the sales floor by brands and merchants. The management is really nice and very flexible with work hours. The most enjoyable part of my job with Dillard's would be the employee discount, it really came in handy when having to buy clothes for school. The hardest part about my job would be the distance I would have to travel from Arlington to Plano on school days."
good,I enjoy setting things up and being creative in my department that im in charge of and making my sales and assisting customers . finding what they are looking for also.
good,"Typically at Dillard's clearance center my day starts in one of three positions. I'm either on a register, operating the fitting room, or recovering and replenishing the sales floor. I've learned quite a bit while working at Dillard's, for example how to, using a register, key in certain sales codes, and what the different department numbers mean. Management generally performs a morning meeting to go over the day's projects with the staff. Most difficult part of the day generally is determining what category certain articles of clothing would fall under, as there is some overlap. Most enjoyable part of the job is definitely meeting people from all over the world."
good,"A typical day at work is organizing merchandise on the floor, assisting customers while they shop for clothes, provide excellent customer service, and make sure area is kept in a clean manner. I also engage with customers to make sure they are receiving the best service they can."
good,"A typical day at work involves keeping the store clean, setting up the floor, bringing out new merchandise, working the cash register, helping customers find what they need, & unloading trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet many types of customers with different backgrounds and cultures."
good,"*When I left this position I was a supervisor who supervised several workers receiving merchandise into the Dillard's inventory system by way of the hand-held scanner and UPC barcode."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's was having a meeting with the associates before the store open. Telling them what is expected for the day. "
good,"Dillard's provides a good working environment with emphasis on punctuality, commitment, and proper service. Co-workers are very kind, and do their best to always uphold themselves to the highest integrity. Management is easy to talk to with the exception of busy days, although they will do their best to accommodate you. The best part of the camera operations jobs is that of playing a major role in store security; loss prevention and customer and employee safety."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's depended on customer flow, some days were really slow, some days were booming. I learned to go with the flow, on slow days I would regroup my department and when we were busy, we straighten as we go."
good,Great company. Decent benefits. Loved my coworkers. Met many lifelong friends there at my location as well as other locations.
good,My store just recently hired a new store manager. He really is great and has helped turned the vibe from the employees around a lot.
good,I enjoyed assisting my customers with their needs. My managers were very nice and helpful.
good,"Sell and suggest fragrances"
good,I did not like the pay and the fact that you can get a decrease in what you make if sales dont go well. Other then that it was ok
good,"As a dock worker my work varies, and have a new task everyday whether i am painting, shipping and receiving goods, processing trucks. My co-workers are pretty cool people."
good,i enjoyed working at dillards i would go back if given the chance. the managers were very kind and understanding. my co-workers where nice but not always team players. hardest part of the job was the rare late nights. the best part was interacting with new people on a daily bases.
good,Working for this company was fun and enjoyable.  I got along well with other employees and we would help each other out when needed.  The hardest part was competition.  I really enjoyed helping others and discount clothes.
good,Great atmosphere with a large amount of theme changes. Inventory nights were not fun but not often either.
good,I love working there you need great people skills. I like to cook and to use the cash register .
good,I had the most fun working here. There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't laugh hysterically. My coworkers were super cool and fun.
good,"A typical day at Dillard's consist of executing the daily/monthly sales quota goal for the counter, and have a plan of action to meet the goal for each beauty advisor. I've learned to properly run a cosmetic line and plan weekly events, and build new and existing business. My current co-workers are all very supportive and positive. Everyone works together as a team. The hardest part of the job, is having to deal with a lot of theft throughout the store. It's unfortunate, but thankfully the situation is getting undercontrol and taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have with my clients, and building that trust and relationship for on-going business throughout."
good,"A typical day at work is my constant ""I want to help you"" attitude. I learn a lot about the lives of my clients and i get to know them on a personal level. "
good,This job is something different every day. Each day brings new customers and new situations to deal with. It can be stressful but also rewarding. It is great to help people find that perfect thing that they are looking for. I have learned a ton from this job. 
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the manager who was there the majority of my time of employment. When management changed, my love for my job waned. Definitely not enough time off for a college student who lived 4 hours away from her family, but great pay for a retail job with opportunities for raises. "
good,"On a typical day at Dillards i come in and if working an opening shift the drawer gets counted.  After that I check my emails, and make sure that any items on the hold shelf are put away.  Depending on coverage i will either check and clean my assigned tables or if working with another associate i will work on backroom aisle assignments, if the former than I do the table work and assist guests until another associate comes in and then I do the aisle assignments.  If there are any mark downs, price changes, or ship orders those will get done before table and aisle assignments."
good,I cleaned the store and on occasion assisted customers and associates as well as processing. I learned how to get things done on a tight schedule. My co-workers were good to work with. Overall the management were good but there were one or two who were hard to work for. I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and customers. The hardest part were the occasional short hours.
good,"I've never worked in Fragrances before and there are tons of information that makes you feel overwhelmed. However, it is knowing the benefits behind a fragrance and the process of making a fragrance."
good,"Dillards is a good place to work if you enjoy retail sales, and don't mind standing on your feet all day. The people are good to work with overall, and the work isn't too hard, but can be stressful during holiday seasons and back-to-school. Almost everyone is required to do the yearly inventory, which is an all-night affair and stinks. It is exhausting and hard on anyone, much less the older employees and single parents who don't get a break at home. They would be better for having a professional inventory team come in."
good,"Dillard's Department Store was my first Job in the United State Of America, I was employed the very same day of my interview They taught me most of everything that was job related and it has enabled me to preform my task in a professional manner within the company for the pass six years."
good,"I was a full time employee at Dillards. I worked 40 hours a week. A typical day included helping customers, running the register and putting out new stock."
good,"Plan my day, review sales from previous day, read email, review markdowns, review my staff, go with cashier to collect money for the ATM, have morning meeting with staff to review sales and plan their strategy for the day with goals and focus items, coach separately on different selling skills, answer associate calls for either customer return issues or store issues throughout day, merchandise, inventory ordering. Every day is different,my co-workers are great as we all work as a team and we help each other out with events and staffing issues. My favorite parts of my day is being able to take care of customers and satisfying their needs."
good,Gave me life skills that I can use in the future. Hard working people always motivated me/
good,It was nice place but I had to leave for better paid job.
good,"Selling products, placing stock and organizing displays. Management was very professional. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the quota in a failing economy."
good,My day starts with cleaning up my bay opening registers. A normal day at Dillards is providing our women customers with the best frgrance that match their body chemistry and personality.
good,"SALES SALES SALES. Typical work day consisted only of selling and exceeding your daily quota for yourself and assigned department. Benefits are great and the incetitives are even better. It is pretty much win or lose, you must have tough skin to endure such a competitive environment. However, I found it very encouraging!"
good,nice place to work if you can handle fast paced work place and like to sell. everything comes second
good,"A typical day at Dillard's included helping customers with their apparel needs, mark down merchandise, organizing merchandise to increase sales, put out new merchandise, clean area, and organize racks often, and open and close down the register. I learned how retail works. I learned the importance of customer service and how merchandising helps increase sales. I loved all my co-workers. Most of them were students and some were full time employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage helping customers and putting out new merchandise on busy shopping days like the weekend. The enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and knowing the walked away satisfied with their purchase."
good,§ Handled inventory responsibilities
good,I liked it but I was also working on my Bachelors Degree I wanted more.
good,Best part of this job was the PEOPLE!
good,I enjoy the fast pace work. I like being busy and productive.
good,Great pay. Very organized. Everyone seems to be on the same page. Very consistent.
good,gets very competitive at times and make the job a little hard to do and get you stressed
good,"My day at work, started with an early meeting with the entire store, we always gave them the sale items plus a picker upper for the day. The manager and operations manager were a great team and I always got along with them both. The hardest part of the job was floor moves....sometimes it insist of moving a department to one floor to the next but we always got out job done with teamwork. The most enjoable part of the job was working with the TEAM and our employees."
good,I loved working for Dillards.They have great values and good trainning.
good,"great place to work, great people and compinsated well. only problem I had was the quota."
good,"Working at Dillard's was the perfect job for a high school student, or college students."
good,"Dillard's was very fast pace. Which I enjoy thoroughly, I volunteered to show up for work two hours before everybody else. The work was just not consistent enough. I did enjoy it though."
good,I loved working here but some of co workers loved to gossip. I had no problem with it personally but eventually hearing it everyday became annoying. Making sales were easy but there was a quota to meet. The discount on great clothes was cool.
good,"If you're interested in starting your career being a salesman, this is the place to go. It'll give you a good starting base for how to be a good salesman and how to interact with customers in a professional way. For the pay, it's not bad, but can be quite boring sometimes, but starting at $13 an hour, I can't complain too much. You do have to meet a sales goal, but you have to NOT try in order not to meet the goal."
good,Dillards Inc is a very fast paced and fun place to work. You have to be on your toes at all times and ready to assist the customers' every need while also keeping your area neat and organized.
good,"This job requires you to stand of course throughout the entire shift. Upside it comes with an 1 hour lunch break and they are flexible with giving you time off. The schedule is made 2 months in advance which is great. The amount of work they require is a bit insane due to the amount of attention each customer needs. Dillard's is a place of extreme customer service and it is difficult to focus on task and floor moves when you have a busy floor, Other than that I enjoyed my four years. I would recommend this job if you are looking for something less stressful. If you don't mind working every weekend and holiday go for it!"
good,The most interesting and challenging work. A great daily routine with different challenges daily. Comparing shortages with the stores cashier and looking at the daily receipts to find the missing money was at times tedious work. It was definitely rewarding work. When finding the missing money.
good,"Used the scanners for markdowns"
good,Just don't do anything to have to speak with the co-workers and you won't get in trouble... I did and I got fired because the lady that said something was a good friend and so since they were friends before they worked there and now I am the one who got let go because they believe her over me even though I was the one being harassed and yelled at constantly.
good,Working at Dillard's was challenging in the sense of choosing clothing to suit someone's body type.  Prom dresses are unique for graduating students.  Making customers happy is a very satisfying and joyful feeling.
good,One of the busiest days for any clothing retail business in the world. Every worker that work at Dillards work on that day. The company buy everyone lunch.
good,"If you enjoy fashion, people, and are sale driven, you could potentially make great money as long as you keep it up! Raises were based upon driving sales and meeting quotas. "
good,Good pay and the store manager was top notch!! I would go back and work for them if I still lived in the area. The only downside is the amount of theft you have to deal with...
good,"Working at Dillards can be competitive and stressful because it a retail establishment. Holiday and big sale events can become chaotic but they do their best to control the chaos. You won't be able to make everyone happy but you strive to. Overall, its a fun environment and the staff are helpful and try to make it a less stressful environment."
good,"I only worked here for a short time, working at the Clinique counter. I really enjoyed learning about make up technique and working with clients to look their best!"
good,"The best part about this job was the pay, which is higher than similar places. "
good,"We were judged monthly on our sales quotas. If a customer bought only 1 item, that counted against your quota. If a customer bought something on sale, that counted against your quota. If you couldn't sell at least 1500 dollars per day the boss would pull you aside and threaten to take away your job. It was not a stable environment."
good,Offered me alot of overtime.Great Benefits Professional Pays great.Clean classy customers.laid me off when i had surgery for basil cell cancer.Fairness Bad.
good,"I loved juggling many things and being on my feet all day.  I was in management, so commissions did not apply to my job description.  It was a good company to work for, and family-owned, which I believe is a plus.  I left because my husband had more work than he could handle, so I went to work with him as a personal trainer."
good,"Always had very unrealistic sales goals and if they were always not accomplished, you always had the fear hanging over you that you were going to be let go. Also, you were always expected to get at least 2 credit applications every week.  No one wanted to get a Dillard's credit card.  This was also counted against you. In the last department I was in, Daniel Cremieur, entirely too much stock was always being delivered into the department on a daily basis and you were always expected to find places to put the stock up and unload the carts so they could use carts to deliver more merchandise. The store had very stick merchandising rules on how each type of clothing on the sales floor was to be merchandise with almost no help or guidance, only criticism on how it was not done the Dillard's way.  Then when you were merchandising the stock if you did not always look up, someone else was taking your customers away from you. So it was a very stressful situation almost all the time."
good,"Dillard's has been great. In the 6 years I've been there, I have been promoted/given a raise 7 times. It's hard work and much is expected of the entire staff. That's why they pay well. The only issue I have is that it's difficult to balance a personal life with working. My intention is to continue as a part time planner for events and special projects that will allow substantial flexibility and very minimal time."
good,"Though the sales goal are high, I still met them! The management is caring, kind, and fun! I never had any troubles with them and they always worked with my schedule!"
good,My job a Dillard's was a good experience because I got to do things that I had not done before. I used to work at Whataburger but it was not the same as being a Sales Associate. The challenging part of Dillard's was that you needed to sell and reach your quota.
good,"• fast paced "
good,Working with my peers was very enjoyable. I learned many department experiences by replenishing incoming merchandise and conducting price control of merchandise. My management personal was great to work with.
good,good company. advancement but you have to be willing to move. Fun environment most of the time. Retail is a hard business these days and I think they do what they can to try and bring in the business.
good,"Well appointed stores, which made it a pleasure to serve customers.  Good variety of merchandise.  Following the store guidelines for Sales Per Hour and Credit Applications could be challenging during slow periods in the year, but it was achievable."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. The work is pretty easy and you will never be asked to work outside of your hired department. Dillard's works hard to make sure their employees are doing a job to the best of their abilities and will send you to workshops to facilitate continuing job education. However, this is completely sales and performance based. To work here you need to be very numbers driven."
good,We Clock in at 7am and work til about 4 unless we was really busy and to work some overtime. Mondays and Fridays was the days we got furniture in for Deliveries. We opened all the the Furniture before Delivering just in case something was wrong with it. We Would call the Customer and let them know if something was wrong with it and if they decided they didn't want us to bring it out we would just schedule a Exchange. If its something they need like a bed or living room furniture we would take the furniture out to them to use until there new stuff comes in. Dillards is a VERY customer friendly Company. The hardest part of the job is the wear and tear and lack of Growth within the company that's the main reason I left.
good,"Typical day at work would be greeting customers while giving product knowledge of what Dillards has to offer in contrast to competitors. Learned a great deal of multitasking with this particular industry. The culture is real old fashioned. There isn't really a difficult aspect on the job, just have to be aware of your commission standings and to stay far way from deficit as possible."
good,Whilst working at Dillard's I did learn a lot about retail based sales and how the market is always changing in retail. With these changes there would have to be great management and clientele to market to.
good,"I learned a lot about sales, the hardest part of the job was meeting your daily goal due to the amount of business. But it also depends on what season it is at that time."
good,"Dillards warehouse my duty as a temp was a pick order. It was face paced but not boring or hard. Just picking shoes, clothes, house acc orders. It was only temp so didnt get a chance to get hired full time."
good,I work as a commissioned sales associate in ladies footwear. Competitive sales environment. The managers are very friendly. Not a lot of room to move up in the company.
good,Basic customer service work skills. Good customer service.  Assisting customer with merchandise and offering customer the oppunity to apply for the store credit card.
good,"Handled customer needs and complaints.  Wrapped customer purchases. Handled cash exchange for sales personnel; balanced registers after store closing.  Hardest part of the job was handling demanding, rude customers.  Most enjoyable part was people interaction."
good,dillard’s is a very nice place but i just want to try a new job description. dillard’s is one of those company’s that wants everything perfect especially the credit penetration. i can’t keep up with my quota that i have to meet so i would rather have a job that doesn’t have anything to do with quotas.
good,"Dillard's is a company of many categories of opportunities. Management opportunities are unlimited for the ability to learn all operational and all merchandising skills and duties such as audits, inventory, special events and visual skills."
good,Typical work day is having a standard goal and working toward that goal to accomplish it. While employed at Dillard's i learned how to market and sell you product. Dillard's management should invest in those that are showing that their willing to invest in themselves. I was told personally I was highly considered for advancement but later was informed they went with someone else unaffiliated with Dillard's. The hardest part about the job is meeting quota on slow days. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer service and building relationships.
good,"You can make great money in retail sales with Dillard's. However, it is sales driven and quotas/goals must be met or termination will occur. This can create a ""shark tank"" environment depending on the department."
good,"I enjoyed going to fashion shows, learning  the new trends and helping ladies with their wardrobes. It was hard to be on my feet  all day and the pay was low."
good,"Mejorar su ambiente de trabajo empezando por el supervisor,que nos ponga más atención el stores manager ,que nos apoyen más como trabajadores,que nos den un poco más de horas,que cuando podamos un día estén un poco asecibles para ayudarnos"
good,"Excellent support to grow in my career in Customer services. "
good,"Managers are flexible, fun work environment. Main issue is making numbers during slow season, and if you don't make numbers after a year, they fire you."
good,overall the work environment is very aggressive. associates try meet their sales quota which means constantly targeting customers.  as long as you are a hard worker and good at selling you will survive.
good,People can be very disrespectful. Management were amazing but sometimes go back on what they say. People take their power of customers to far and rude.
good,"We begin the day with a general store meeting, opening our registers and readying our area to welcome customers. This is a fast paced environment, more at times and less at others. One must be product knowledgeable and able to work with customers in good times and bad times. One learns to care for their department and for their customers. For the most part, fellow co-workers are team players and welcome opportunities to share tips and help when needed. Working together is always a good investment for all involved! Working on ones feet for long hours and working during inventory and sales events are stressful, however, they don't seem quite so bad when we reap the benefit of a sale prices plus employee discounts!"
good,Atypical day at work we are assigned daily quotas. Our attitudes had to be positive that way customers can see you are open and willing to help assist them with their questions or concerns. I learned that some customers just enjoy the conversation with employees they see often when they shop. The hardest part is the competitive co-workers who try to overstep your sale. The enjoyable part of the job is bonding with the staff and co-workers.
good,The Dillard store is a well organized place to work and is well managed. Also the amazing people I work with makes the day go by smoothly there. I enjoy working with everyone in the store.
good,Dillard's was a fun but busy workplace that always was concerned about the customers. It had itup and downs like any other job but for the most part it was a pertty cool place to work.
good,The managers were supportive and understanding of the tough goals but it was still an expectation to meet. They had your back against customer complaints and truly did everything they could to help you out.
good,"Most days are chill (except sale days, of course). There's always something to do enough so that you don't get bored but not enough that it's stressful. The most stressful part was reaching your sales goal."
good,"In my own experienced, working Dillard's is not that bad, there were days work is so stressful if I don't have any customer no matter how hard I tried to get in touch with them invite to come to the store and offer them some new products, offer them to have a free Spa, etc.  I get stress so easy if I don't get my daily sales goal. Dillard's has a good benefits from medical insurance to vacations compared to other retail stores, environment is very clean, I have a good relationship with the managers and and get along with other sales associates.  It's a safe place to work."
good,Dillard's is definitely a competitive atmosphere but it gives you a great work experience. You work off of commission in some departments or SPH in others. They really want you to push products/promotions and urge you to build a personal relationship with customers. It really does take a person with exceptional customer service skills to succeed and LAST there. The pay is reasonable and the benefits are even better.
good,"Great place, decent pay but no raises which sucks... but discounts are amazing and sales associates are pleasant! no advancing though. Unless you are looking to do retail management."
good,Dillard's is a good place to work with advancement by your hard work that you do.   I learned about the products I sold that I can take with me  from now on. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that knew how to sell their product.  I learned from them.
good,There is always something to do but very competitive. Even if we had no customers we were suppose to meet our sales quota. If we did not meet it we would lose pay
good,"The same duties were performed at Deerbrook Mall as was in Pearland Town Center. The duties are all the same, just different clients. No advancement opportunity, I was at the top of the pay scale for my position."
good,Good place to work.  Interact with lot of people.  Customer service was interesting and never the same.  Duties from balancing cash drawers to accepting payments.  A lot of phone duties on multi-line phone.  Wrapping gifts can be fun and stressful at holidays.
good,A typical day of work consisted of greeting the customers and assisting them in what ever need. The workplace is calm usually unless there is a sale going on.
good,Good place but closing hours till 9:15 pm twice a week and working all holidays and weekends make it hard on personal life and family time.  Still a good place to work for students who study during the day and can work later hours
good,I enjoyed working retail and dealing with the customers.  The management was good and the workplace enviroment was good.  The most difficult part of the job was learning all of the new merchandise as it came in daily.
good,"First step into a larger company, little higher class in fashion then I was used to, adapted very well learning more fields in retail with customers.."
good,Well made clothes.  Nice people to work with and management is friendly. They could be a little rude to some of the employees working under them. Good discounts on merchandise. It can get very busy around the holidays and you do a lot of standing and walking around but time goes by quick. I loved the hours. Dillards doesn't even open until noon on Sundays.
good,"inbound & outbound calls,,,assisting customers navigate the website. problem solving. no room to move up . laid back call center. The pay isnt all that great....but the managers do work with your scheduling"
good,Unloading trucks at my age is against me.  People were great to work with.  My stamina was not that great.  Anyone even ten years younger would be abme to do this.
good,Got the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people and connect with customers. Fun fast pace environment. Got the opportunity yo learn a lot about merchandising.
good,Must have open availability on all shifts 9:45-9:10. Sales shark environment. Must be able to communicate with the public and be a star at making customers have. A five start company.
good,Selling apparel and talking with customers. I learned the apparel area of the 1st floor of Dillard's. Management was operational and did not coincide with associates very often. Work culture was very competitive. The hardest part of the job was keeping the area organized and keeping everything in the right place and the knowledge of where everything is. The most enjoyable part was the commission based sales and being in control of part of your payment and the ends of the week.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working in cosmetics at Dillard's. The management was intense and at times, extremely unrealistic. It's a constant moving company. The sales goals are almost unreachable."
good,A typical day at the Clinique counter was entertaining and instructive at the same time because we would learn about different products in depth on a daily basis. The manager was supportive and had an open door policy.
good,Dillards is an roller coaster of a job. Depending on the type of manager you get you can easily do your job or it can be a hassle even if you are an extremely hard worker
good,Dillard's is an amazing corporation that will always provide excellent benefits and work environment for its employees. I advanced very quickly with them but I was no longer able to work nights.
good,The job was ok while I was in college. The company didn't seem to really have employees in mind.  It was all about Dillards making plenty of money.  I guess.
good,"Dillards starts with a great pay but to be given raises you must maintain a high sales average daily. To be honest, it's all about customer service. What you put in you will get out. You're managers will be kind and respectful if you tend to your job. The pay is certainly worth the work, especially with the low rate of pay at any given jobs these days."
good,Surprisingly competitive sales force working here. The store I worked out of the majority of my time was in a poor location making sales even tougher but overall fun working here.
good,"Great environment, but the work can be very competitive. It is a fun place to work, constant change and when it is busy your days fly by. But in the off season most of your day is wasted walking in a circle."
good,"I enjoyed working and learning my role as a Men's Shoe Associate.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people from all walks of life, learning something about them and assisting them with their needs. The most difficult part of the job was making quota when the customers just weren't in the store. The workplace culture was very competitive-sometimes difficult when coworkers are fighting amongst themselves for customers and sales.  I had little to no contact or conversation with upper management.  My immediate supervisor was fantastic."
good,I loved working on Dillard's. Very friendly and professional environments. Management was great and gave very good instruction on how to set up and display new item. love doing mark down.
good,"An easy job for a student or someone just looking to get out of the house. Great employee discount and quality selection of merchandise. The work environment was very competitive for sales and some employees would make sure you knew who was their regular and be mad if you rang them up. It could be stressful at times to keep your sales numbers up because it was a low traffic store, but I met some good friends while working there and it taught me how to work in a cut throat sales environment."
good,"Working at Dillard's is not only great because of it's high pay compared to other retail stores, but they also work with your schedule if you have to go to school. "
good,"As it's a commission base job it is very difficult to achieve the required target in a limited period of time. Also, we get commissions after we achieve our goals."
good,"Opportunity for advancement, eligible benefits.  minimum work/life balance. Customer service driven, multi task is mandatory. flexible schedule.  paid vacation."
good,"Dillard's is a very fun and competitive work environment to be a part of. On a typical day as a sales associate, our duties are to put the customers first, provide excellent customer service to the guest, and make our sales quota. When business is slow, projects are executed fast and efficiently (re-merchandising, re-stalking product, executing markdowns, etc.)."
good,Great place for an aspiring sales person. Great as far as a consistent job and work load. It does pit you against other associates for sales and numbers. This aspect makes the selling process difficult if you are not competitive. Asking for time off can be difficult but not 100% impossible
good,"I've worked in three different departments kids, cosmetics, and men's. All were very different from management to how to sell. In my years of working, you must do the work without being told to do so. Quotas are too high to be achievable. Management sets goals that are unrealistic in today's business industry. You are your own boss in the department you work in (specialist). 5 Star customer service is what they strive for, but it's really all about how much you sell. The only enjoyment I found working there was the coworkers, and the customers that came back to me. Also management won't confront you unless there's an issue with sales. Other than that you're on your own, which is nice if you consider to work alone."
good,"You're expected to make A LOT of sales. That may be easy in a bigger store but I worked in the smallest DIllards in Oklahoma, so it was doable...but tough. You're also required to inquire a pretty large number of credit cards each month. This task wasn't too bad and we always had ""credit competitions"" where we were rewarded with bonuses, in-store credit, and gifts."
good,"Working at Dillards was not something I regret. The environment was fast paced and challenging. Very upbeat and lively other than a few employees. The only downside to their company is their steep commission versus hourly algorithms. It was hard to maintain their quota, and made employees take your customers."
good,"If you are a great sales person, you will do wonderful at Dillard's. Sales are stressed greatly and your pay is based off of how well you sell. Management does not inform you, upon hiring, how important your sales are to your pay. They pay really well starting out but it is possible to get a pay cut at your review."
good,"Dillards Allows you to be very creative in creating new business. The store Manager is very involved in day to day business, The store is clean and current with on going trends."
good,"Overall it's a nice place to work at, nice employees. Good hours, it provides enough time for personal life. It rarely gets busy, but when it does everyone work towards recovering the store and helping customers. The managers are also nice and will work well with you."
good,"Stable company with nice working environment. I worked for the Christian Dior counter and it was such a great ability to learn. Dior company provided an excellent training and venders support for a new sales people. I was so happy to work for Dior. Dillard's company is very stable and provides many benefits for an employees. Pay rate per hour is low, but you will enjoy if you going to work as a part-timer."
good,Definitely love working there! But there is a hierarchy you have to follow to get promoted. You might stay in your position for a year before they consider you for a promotion. Which sucks.
good,"Management not very organized and Dillard's is a very old fashioned place to work for. The computer system is so old. Overall, not a bad environment to work in, however very competitive."
good,"I liked working at Dillard's for the most part. It got difficult at times while I was working 2 jobs, but the pay was worth it. It was hard trying to get people to sign up for a store credit card. Most people weren't interested and there's only so many times you can ask a person to sign up for something before it gets annoying."
good,Working here allowed me to work with different people from all ranges again. Was able to make orders and direct my own people and work at my own pace. They allowed me to explore more creative side.the store closed before was able to reach full potential.
good,Great field to work in. I was the camera operator and there wasnt a day where i didnt have something to do. this position keeps you on you P's and Q's all day. everyday is different. coworkers are supportive and helpful. hardest part of the day is closing.
good,"The average day at work can be slow, but the customers that shop at Dillard's are extremely friendly and kind. They make it easy to smile and deliver good service. Fellow Employees are also kind and make the workplace a fun situation to be in."
good,There are lots of departments that one can work in- there are a lot of tasks that you can master and that may shape you for other job options- there is an ability to advance and pay raises according to performance
good,"It was a great sales experience because of how much different designer clothing Dillard's carried."
good,"My typical day at work was giving out cards with men cologne sprayed on the cards . I learned while i was there that cologne had stages to go through before you really actually smelt the true scent of the cologne . the management there was very demanding and strict of making your quota for the day but i guess management is management know matter who you are. coworkers some wonderful others not so wonderful but i learned not to let that bother me. lol...!!!"
good,"Overall the job was very simple, and was very hard to to be bad at it. I was able to improve on my customer service skills. The managers did treat good but the co-workers were amazing to work with."
good,"To me, working in retail is pretty easy if you're a shopaholic like myself. I basically got paid to shop all day. Be it wishful thinking for myself, or helping others shop to look good. The most rewarding feeling is when you help an insecure young lady find her inner style that she is comfortable with and she leaves with a smile on her face. I enjoyed that part the most about my job."
good,"Great wages, but unreasonable sales quotas. Welcoming work environment, kind and understanding managers. Not very much foot traffic which makes the job pretty slow and boring."
good,Retirement and medical insurance .Customer friendly environment. I enjoyed meeting  and working with people. Setting  and achievements  in making goals and high standard of services.
good,A typical day at Dillard's was slow and a little boring. I learned how to keep myself busy in the not so busy times. Management was kind and understanding yet strict. My co-workers were also kind and friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping your numbers up since there isn't much foot traffic. The most enjoyable part is connecting with the customer.
good,"The store I worked at was a flagship store for Dillards in Arkansas but was slow business. Dillards taught me professionalism, and management took care of me and I returned the favor to make sales to the best of my ability."
good,Job required to help customers when purchasing items. Clean work areas. Restock inventory. Put up inventory when it arrived  from warehouse. Keep track of cash register.
good,"Much like the title of this, Dillard's is a great place to work and advance. The issue is management and unfortunately it's not exclusive to just one store. Management is terrible, and corporate doesn't care about it. Other than that, co-workers are awesome, customers are even more awesome."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's consisted of assisting at least fifty customers with purchases, online orders, and returns. "
good,Working and helping customers was the highlight.  I enjoyed all the hours I was given.  The hardest part of the job is working Sundays.  I learned how to really read clients and their body language in order to help them feel comfortable and confident past the dressing room door.
good,My typical work days consisted of selling to the clients and merchandising the products. I learned how to be a competitive sales person and to meet goals set for me. My co-workers were great to work with and I made friends with them outside of work. The hardest part of my job was to sell to customers when sports teams were playing that day/night. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all the different people and making their shopping experience great!
good,They will teach you everything for the job and as you progress you will learn more and more about all aspects of the operation. i learned how to repair furniture and route delivery schedules in the short time i was there before relocating.
good,It's a decent place to work pay is ok you just gotta keep your sales up. The starting pay is good and you can take off whenever and get approved.
good,"Great pay, management was great...treated employees respectfully."
good,Dillards has given me a great opportunity to grow and enhance my managerial skills sets. I continued to develop my people skills and collaborate within the store with multiple departments on a daily basis in order to achieve sales goals. Successfully managed a team to surpass sales goals and maintain department standards on a daily basis. Continue to grow customer base and increase awareness within the store and the department by exceeding customers expectations with superior customer service.
good,Great hours and work-environment.  The opportunity for advancement isn't very open.  Great employees.  I never saw much room for advancement although I enjoyed this job very much.
good,Being able to get an insight on sales goals it was fun to sell and help people to meet those goals while helping customers. It especially helped me with my managing of Leslies stores when it came to managing stores down the road and setting goals and expectations. .
good,Dillard's provides a fun retail environment and works with my school schedule with ease. They give employees an opportunity to sharpen their sales and social skills.
good,It was my first sales job where I was truly accountable for my actions with the customer. It broke the ice for me in sales and to relate with the customer. I had great coworkers and an amazing manager.
good,Most enjoyable part of job was merchandising.  Associates were great.  Sales goals were difficult to attain.  There was good partnership between managers.
good,"Dillard's is a place where you come in ready to work. There are many regular customers and new customers that come into the stores shopping for Brands like Michael Kors, Kenneth Cole, BCBG, Steve Madden, Uggs, and more. I never had any problems wile working there."
good,A typical work day consisted of sales and organization. I was able to maintain sales and also grow with the company. The management was okay but could have been better when it came to working with employees on the sales floor.
good,"Fun place to work, management is great. Everyday is a new day to learn and grow.I moved up in the company very quick, it is a competitive work place but I think that is what makes it more fun."
good,"I operated the cash registers, helped assist customers, assisted the fitting rooms, zoned my department. I learned responsibility such as customer assistance, punctuation, time management. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, management and customers."
good,"The Managers have a good balance between ""This is what we need to do to be a success as a team"" and being personable. I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing people with outstanding personalities. The part of the job I love the most would be between the excitement of the customer when we find exactly what they are wanting and the feeling of accomplishment when daily goals are exceeded. The hardest part of the job would be slow moments with very few customers in the store. I need to keep busy so it has become a playful and harmless picking that I am a little OCD when it comes to my counter being clean and organized!!!!!"
good,Working at dillard's has Been a very eye opening experience. I have worked in many different departments with in the store which has brought me to have better product knowledge about high end brands which helps me to better service my clients. The management at Dillards is extremely reliable and helpful. They are always there to assist me when I have questions and concerns and they work with my school schedule so there is no over scheduling.
good,"My Cosmetic managers were great and always worked with my schedule, the pay was great but none of the store managers cared about you, they only cared about how much you sold in a day."
good,"Typical Day: Check sales, email and print and distribute price changes to departments when needed. Assist customers. "
good,"Job was efficient, safe and fun. I would love to work here again for this company, otherwise I was being used to conduct jobs not within my job title."
good,"Dillard's was a great partner and employer that helped to foster a creative, management oriented skill set that enabled positive publicity and profit oriented margins"
good,"ENjoyed working with customers everyday. The jobs was enjoyable which made it come a little easier for me. I learn how to keep up with inventory and maintain logs of everything. And got to deliver feed to customers. Co-wokers were great to be around , kept each other in good moods all day. The job only got hard when a big order came up, when you had to load up everything."
good,Awesome place to work. I expressed my excellent customer service and sales skills. The management team is also great. I enjoyed this job very much.
good,"I learned new things about fragrances and make up daily, and worked with some friendly people, some not. Its a competitive job at times and it can cause tension. Management was constantly changing, never really got to know my managers. Some were very professional and a few played favorites. The hardest part of my job was making my quota every day. But the friendly customers and people I get to meet make up for it."
good,Never a dull moment at Dillards. There is always something to do. The staff and managers are very friendly and are always able and willing to help with any concerns you might have.Dillards can be very flexible with your schedules as well.
good,I loved my job as a Sales Associate. My day would start around 9am and I would open the registers and add the correct amount of money to each cash register. After I opened the registers I usually went through my customer contact book to see which customers I hadn't seen and call and inform them of their favorite brand of new clothing coming in. Maintained a very healthy relationship with most of the customers. I loved my co-workers who were very creative as well and throughout the day we would put away clothes and rearrange the store and master the visual displays. The hardest part of the job was making my sales quota in a department that was in the back of the store and many people went elsewhere to pay for purchases which affected the sales quota of many of the employees who worked in the quiet part of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers feel beautiful. They loved the way I put things together for them. It felt really good to help the customers and to see them walk away happy.
good,"For the most part everyone gets along with everyone one else to do the best job possible.  Does give words of encouragement and working on commission you can make more money,"
good,"A typical day at Dillards is truly a wonderful experience. Every day you meet someone new and strive to make their day by trying to make their shopping experience truly fun and amazing. The competitiveness isn't something I truly enjoy, for working as a team and helping one another is something I prefer. By the end of the day, I still enjoy the atmosphere at work, but am looking to leave retail."
good,Our daily routine was to open all registers on all of your department. Checking the fitting rooms often and to finger space all the clothes. If new stock came in we had to put everything away asap. Cleaning was a very important part of the job. We had to maintain the merchandise organized. Our main priority was to provide excellent customer service and to keep up with sales. My coworkers were on point with everything but we prioritized customers. Working here was not easy but it was nothing that couldn't be handled. I enjoyed the opportunity to meet people and make them feel comfortable with spending their money on good quality merchandise with good prices.
good,"Very busy, fun place to work.  Great meeting lots of people.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied customers."
good,"Dillards is an ok job. I worked in cosmetics for 8 years if you don't make your sales per hour you get a pay cut. I went to furniture enjoyed it and made good money"
good,"Great company to work for. Can be cut throat at times like any other sales job. I really enjoyed working . I may even go back one day. Paid weekly. The only thing I can say I didn't like about the company was that they didn't reward their top sellers the way they could have,"
good,"At Dillard's I learned how to deal, help, and do my best at satisfying customers. Working their help to improve my skills at multitasking to get my work done."
good,"I would go in to work and make sure everything looked nice, help out any of the customers, if there wasn't any customers, i would straighten up all the shoes and if there was any shipments i would put them away and put any of our new shoes out on display. "
good,"The typical work day was fitting women for the appropriate under garment.  I actually learned that the right fitting under garment can lift spirits as well as self esteem.  The management was ok, and coworkers were fighting for sales.  The hardest part about the job was reaching sales goals on days when there were no customers, and when the coworkers were fighting and stealing sales.  I enjoyed the fact that I got to help and meet new people."
good,"Sales being the primary objective, it was a fast pace and competitive work environment, but also very relaxed social setting."
good,"I have learned how to push myself and others beyond what they felt they could accomplish.   Co-workers wether they are in Management or on my staff have taught me so much and helped me to grow."
good,I worked with a few girls to make as many sales as I could. There were some slow days but I would make them count. I loved doing makeovers and working together with my co-workers to give the ladies a better sales experience. There was little room for advancement but other than that I liked it.
good,"As long as your numbers are being made, there is nothing to worry about."
good,"It was the perfect first job. I started when I was 16 and worked there untiil I graduated high school. I made some life long friends there and had a blast for those 3 or so years of working there. It was a shame that the business didn't make it, but I am really glad I got that experience."
good,"There was always something different to do...I have learned how to paint, installed bulbs that are 50 feet off the ground."
good,"Helping customers find clothes that fit them so they will come back and shop and tell others as well, is a typical day at Dillard's.The hardest part of my job is when we have slow days and I don't make my quota."
good,Better customer service than other big name dept. stores. Company likes to promote from within.
good,working at Dillard's was fun people was very nice and helpful but the business was slow
good,Working at Dillards was very productive. Having to achieve a daily goal gives you a chance to challenge yourself. Connecting with customer was very rewarding because they always came back and looked for me. The manager and coworkers were nice and we worked good together as a team to meet the departments goal.
good,work at Dilllard's was a good experience I enjoyed packing and wrapping. The management there was some very nice and frendly people. A very nice working enviorment.
good,"floor changes, sales, price changes, inventory loved my co workers and supervisors"
good,My experience with the competitve sales environment at Dillards has always been good.
good,Loved working for Dillards until the economy changed.  Was required to do things I was not comfortable doing to my great customer base.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard's. There are many complaints about the company, but I have had a positive experience there. I've never found a manager that wasn't compassionate when I needed time off or a special unauthorized day off."
good,"A great culture to work in."
good,"It's a beautiful well maintained store in the finer part of Bee Cave in west Austin. It's a small county and fitting to its size the store is also small. Due to this, the staff gets too close for comfort and the line between private and professional vs. fraternization and gossip gets blurred. This hurts the employee's pockets as well as the store's. The department store version of ""one of those small towns where everyone knows everyone's business because they make it a business to."" "
good,"I work in the home department. I sell bedding, sheets, houseware, kitchenware, and other home goods. I work closely with customers to make sure they get the best service possible. We do all our home processing and shipments in the home department. There are high quotas to meet."
good,"Working at Dillard's was an overall good experience, management treated workers with respect. My only problem would be dress code, my store was required to dress in business attire in nothing less then 2 inch heels for women. For me, being on your feet for 7 and 8 hours a day without being able to sit is very strenuous on you body while wearing heels."
good,"Excellent average retail/department employment. I was able to effectively do my job with minimal conflict issues. Great management, would work under them again in the future, given the proper chance."
good,"Interaction with people, help people with any products, and learn so much with customer services, my co-workers was good, team work and helping each other, was a good experiencie for me and help me grow more like a person. I make alot of good friends."
good,"The starts by checking your cash register,spruce up your area and be ready to greet customers with a smile. Two things I learned...be punctual in clocking in and out. Management was nice and co-workers helpful but not so friendly. Most of them are out to grab customers you are assisting because of the quota. If you don't reach the qouta given , a certain % is deducted from your salary but if you go beyond , a % is added.This is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is when a customer go overboard buying merchandise when they are pleased with the way you assist them."
good,"fun place to shop with good markdown sales, high end products to shop from, enough help to cover the sales floor. "
good,Because of the economic and demographic of the location of the store it is unable to maintain your sph which lead to employees being laid off. Store do not offer incentives for customers to continue shopping in these hard economic times.
good,Most enjoyable part of the day was meeting and taking care of the needs of customers. I was in lower level management so I respected the upper level and did as I was told going above and beyond what was expected. Typical day at work was fast paced and diverse.
good,"maintain sales per hour goal, helping customers find a fragrance that fits them. Maintain  stock and inventory for items. Customer service is very important to Dillard's. Management is good in the strip location.Is not easy to move up in the company.    "
good,good place to work generally some co-workers are very chatty and some plain jealous.
good,could get very busy waiting on more the one customer at a time
good,"It was a great place to work at, but when the recession hit us, our sales started going down and some of us were let go. but other than that I enjoyed my job everyday"
good,Very competitive...Must meet sales quotas even on slow days
good,A typical day consists of assisting customers on their make-up and skin care products. I atteneded numerous skincare classes with the help of management. My co-workers and I worked very hard to meet counter sales goals.
good,"Clock into work, We would have a meeting every morning. Counted register. greet and help customers with their purchases. Handled customers problems and inquiries. Train new employees. Take inventory of old and new products. Turned in draw and paper work at the end of day. The hardest part was standing on your feet. The enjoyable part was my Co- Workers."
good,sales and customer relations
good,Making ladies pretty
good,A typical day at Dillard's consists of maintaing the floor at all times and always be taking care of whatever customers you have. The Associate is allowed to do so independently for the most part which goes a long way. Suggesting multiple items is a must in order to possibly make a commission.
good,I love helping people feel better about themselves. Helping them to step out of the box and expirement new looks and trends. I make even the grumpiest customer smile and have fun by the time they leave. Management is great. They work with you on any problems you have.
good,"I enjoyed this job along with my co-workers, had to leave due to store closing, didn't want to store not staying open much longer."
good,"came in to work got right to work it was second shift so it kinda went by fast,but work was easy"
good,Enjoyed meeting new people and loved the lingerie department. We had a great team who worked very well together. The hardest part of the job was when there was no customers for us to make our sale goals. But we kept busy with stock and display. I loved my job.
good,Minimal supervision. Make your own schedule. The only bad thing is the sales goals. You have to sell more than your goals to get a raise and if you dont meet your goals you get your pay decreased and then you have one more chance to bring it up or you lose your job. Also they like to hire more people than they need to work in an area so that you have to fight it out with your coworkers over the sales.
good,Working at Dillards was enjoyable I enjoyed interacting with co-workers and the competition to make the most sells. I learned different brand names and sales. I enjoyed assisting customers with making choices from what to wear to a wedding or night out. Management was fair and approchable
good,I loved working for Dillard's. The management was amazing. (It was 10 years ago). Back then the personal integrit y of the management was top notch. I can't say I would work for them now. The workplace was very competitive. You had to make certain sales goals an hour; if you didn't you would get a verbal. You can't complain about management... it was defined in store policies.
good,Easy relaxing in the morning but sometime hictic.Handled all customer service manage register and customer service meeting new friendly people management is great co worker are friendly the hardest part of the job is to say goodbye to your co-worker the most enjoable part of the job is to work of all the people in the whole department.
good,"During my time with Dillard's, I worked under two store managers and three ops managers. My first manager was somewhat inattentive to his responcibilities as a manager. However, that being said, he was always kind to me and often would tell me how much he appreciated me and that I was doing a great job. He was released from the store for misconduct.The ops manager was over-bearing, dominating and threatend me. She was ultimately transfered to another location as a repremand to her behavior. She was replaced by a woman from a near by location who I must say is the finest manager I have had the opportunity to work for in all my 30+ years. I would work for her again. She was transfered back to her other store as the store manager. She was then replaced by a woman who had been a territorial merchandise manager. We worked very well together. She treated me well, like a friend and trusted me with extremely confidential information and proceedures. The new store manager who replaced our terminated manager was by far the worst manager I have worked for. He was demeaning towards me. Often put me down and used intimidation to push me around. I went from being happy to be there to wanting to cry every day I left for work. I am an individual with some physical challenges needing to be in a seated position so the job as secretary suited my needs. He wanted to put me on the sales floor. I had requested a chair that would meet my needs and was told no, that maybe I might leave my position and the next person might not like my choice of chairs. I finaly got my own chair only to come to my desk"
good,Dillard's has great pay and benfits. It can be a fun experince and you can learn a lot.
good,"people friendly, fun place to work and build people skills, communication, and customer service"
good,"The company has good plans in place to achieve success & harmony."
good,Great place to work at. Friendly workers. Great pay. The hardest part of the job was the quote each day but it got easier day by day. It was very busy Fridays - Sundays.
good,"The job is very competitive. You have to maintain a certain SPH, so therefore everyone is fighting for sales. Does not feel good at times. I enjoy Bra fitting because it is life changing for some people."
good,"Punch in on time, head to my department section, and interact with customers in my area. I would educate customer on certain brands of sunglasses, probe for their needs, and suggest they open credit card account if they don't have one. If they do, suggest they use it. I love the independent control i have of taking care of my area from organizing to sorting. One hour lunch if you are full-time, pays well, and always work 38 hrs per week if full time. Loved it the only downside is the quota is unrealistically high everyday so on days were no customers come by i was still showing negative sales and it adds up. By the end of year review you are let go if you don't meet the quota. It use to be a pay deduction of a dollar each time, but the policies got worse overtime. Its great if you have a backup job , but if you go to college, it be hard to balance both for scheduling is not in your favor usually. Still great job i only wish i worked there years ago when it was less stressful."
good,"I honestly really liked working there and I liked the people (sometimes), but I will say that it’s outrageously hard to meet your sales goals and more than likely if you don’t meet it then by the time your 3 month review comes along, you’ll most likely be terminated"
good,I enjoyed working with others and helping customers find exactly what they came to shop for and keeping the customers satisfied. It was a great opportunity to meet other people.
good,"If you love retail and are looking for the opportunity to advance, Dillard's is the place. There is always something new every day, the retail environment is always changing and you must be able to adapt."
good,"*Meeting the need of the customers is number one priority.  "
good,Company's focus is customer service. Employees are trained to focus on customers happiness. Hours are flexible and employees raise is based on sales. Good sales are appreciated.
good,great place to work. The managers are great. The environment is great. Everything about working a Dillards is great great great great great great! !!!
good,The company in general is a great company to work for as long as you strive to be your best and make goals. The retail hours are terrible and that's the only reason I would want to find another job.
good,"At first, I loved it. All of the managers were wonderful. An assistant manager was hired, and many people quit due to her and the unnecessary changes she was making. She is gone now. At the time that I worked there, nothing but teenagers were being hired. So, as you can guess, it had its moments with drama. Most of the girls did not get along."
good,I loved working for the company . I left only because they were not flexible with vacation hours . The company was fast paced and it keep us on our feet. We interacted with customers everyday .
good,Great place to work . I have never had any issues other than military things but that’s about it and they kind work with that but I guess other than that it’s ok
good,"I liked working here, fun to help customers find clothes that they liked to buy. Saturdays were mandatory. Sometimes it could be boring when it was slow."
good,"Count the drawers for correct change, record register tallies, shipping, gift wrapping. processing returns and refunds.  I enjoyed most of the sales staff"
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, can be very fast paced depending on how many customers are in the store. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers when the store is having a sale. Most enjoyable part is helping the customers with what they are looking for. Management is good."
good,"good place because of the other employees and some managers are good,  good discounts and benefits room for growth, good hours,but the store managers can be too hard and expect too much way too much, and give you a hard time and pressure you with credit cards,"
good,its ok not bad place to work. i learned more sales. also different counters. learned about a lot of counters and interacted with a lot of different guests.
good,"Great entry level job to start, good starting pay, some positions hourly plus commission, would do it again in the right store. Some managers better than others. High employee turnover"
good,Dillard’s compensation was great. It’s easy work and you get rewarded for doing a good job. Over all my experience there was great. Management was very professional.
good,I worked at Dillard’s a little over 8 month I loved the pay ! It was easy job just keeping up with register customer service is the number 1 priority. I loved the timing only reason I left was school and baby at home just didn’t give me enough time
good,It is very encouraging and this job pushes you to your ultimate level of selling brands and products. This company provides a warm safe place to shop and feel free to express the needs of customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard’s. The management actually cares about you. The pay was great, plus you get paid every week. You get benefits, PTO, and they work around your schedule if you have a certain day you need off. The only thing that was unrealistic was the quotas they give you each day. If you aren’t competitive or a driven salesperson, then it’ll be tough to meet your quota."
good,"Dillards does promote from within.  When I retired I still wanted to work a few more years. The company is one of the few stores I felt was stable from a great deal of research. I enjoy my co workers, and the team we have at our store. Benefits and store discount are great too."
good,Overall a great place to work with lots of different opportunities. Management and staff are great and easy to get along with. Company provides benefits for both part time and full time employees. Good work/life balance.
good,"Theirs still ways of growth in the company with it being one of the most larger companies for human related items. From being the in the back of the building mostly, need for more space for items and storage."
good,"you'll have a quota and if you reach it you keep your job. that's not hard. if you pass it, you can get a raise. again, not difficult. the trouble is employees that have been there longer feel that you'll take customers away from you, and they'll hover over you. they'll also be rude to you. managers were great, very respectful. only concern is the employees you'll have to deal with. as a full-time worker, it isn't that bad because you'll have many chances to get your sales. but it isn't work it as part time."
good,Dillards is a great place to see new people and interact with them. customer service is excellent and friendly environment among all sales and non sales associates.
good,This was flexible and friendly place to work.  I enjoyed my time working there and learned many skills that helped in my full time career.  I would recommend to anyone.
good,I Ike’s working for Dillard’s. Good hourly wage $14.00  and $3.75/hour average Commission in low volume store. The department manager sets the tone for the department as does the store manager for the store.
good,when working for dullards it was a great learning experience. The company is very good and they help you to drive and push yourself to perform greatly
good,"A typical work day at Dillard's is always a surprise. Everyday is slightly different than the previous day. The main focus is customer service, which is what keeps the business going. Dillards' management is a team of hardworking individuals who will guide their employees in the right direction if need be. The culture of Dillard's is very upbeat and productive. There are many enjoyable parts of the job at Dillard's. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer satisfaction."
good,"If you are motivated, and focused. You could really make good money with Dillards. Its fast paced, and quota driven. However if you can sell and lead your opportunities are endless. It is a stressful environment be warned ,but it can definitely be worth it. Great Management, wonderful people."
good,Dillard’s was a fun job!!  It offered good benefits and fair pay.  I was able to work my way up to operations manager which gave me valuable experience and opened doors to further my career in higher paid jobs.
good,"Dillard's focus on the customers' needs. Employees must achieve daily goal sales to ensure they are having full interaction with customers; Cosmetics, Men's suits, and the shoe department is commission based."
good,Theres plenty of opportunity to make money while you are there and pretty decent benefits as well. Getting hired on can be a little difficult but its best to apply in person then go through the temp agencies.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dillard's.. I had a wonderful manager.,It was sometimes stressful  trying to keep sales up while doing markdowns and freight..I met a lot of incredible associates and the customers are the best. I would be there today had I not gotten injured."
good,"had fun all day while helping people, could not ask for for much more. talked and met new people every day and learned how to improve my sales skills."
good,"Dillars was a good enviorment to work at, The employs was easy to get along with, the managers loved me i felt like i could call that place home, they gave me enugh hours to take care of myself and family and i would mind going back."
good,"Typical day is sorting through merchandise, pricing merchandise, and putting merchandise out on the racks to  be purchased. Helping customers as they come in to shop, and checking them out at the counter to complete their purchase."
good,A typical day at work at Dillard …..where assisting customers with there needs. Management where very helpful . The hardest part of the job for me was the standing .
good,"Working at dillards was fun and challenging at the same time."
good,"Dillard's was a fun place to work and I believe I was fairly compensated. Needed to stay on your feet, but friendly staff. Nice group of associates. Corporate standards."
good,I interviewed with the store GM. I took good notes and I also was sent to school for their cosmotology department. I worked in all area's of the store.
good,I enjoyed my job at Dillard's. I started my trucking driving career there. It was a good well managed company. This was 25 years ago. I was home most nights.
good,this is a production job and it has been a while since worked there but i made okay money while there but every time you brought your production pay up the changed the rules and pay rate to lower your production. you have slow periods and fast paced periods.
good,"I worked for Dillard's for 6 1/2 years and loved the management, but the management changed and there was no more communication, no more weekly employee meeting, no one knew any promotions or events that were going on in the various department. The mall I worked in had 3-Dillards stores it was very BIG. It's hard to work for a business when the store (general) manager has no respect for any of his employees. I have never worked for a manager that acted like he was above everyone. He also canceled employee of the month which was another incentive."
good,"you worked by the hour and on commission in the shoe department.Repricing , stocking , very competitive. The hardest part was competing with other sales personal.Sales personal were only concerned with their sales , not in helping you learn the business."
good,"They had a very good teamwork type environment where everybody worked together really well.I enjoyed my time there a lot and would work there again if the pay was better,"
good,"Dillard's was a career driven company and the staff was fun. I really had to work on my sales game there. Commission was a must , otherwise if I did not make my target for the month your job would be lessened ."
good,"While being a Division Director, I traveled extensively to 15 stores to train and transition newly acquired stores into the Dillard's family.  This was a challenging but very rewarding work experience-- great company!"
good,My typical day at work started off good every morning with prayer. I learn how to be a team player. Management was good. Workplace culture there was no judging what culture you came from. There wasnt hard about this job. I really enjoyed and loved this job because i loved my customer to leave happy
good,"The company explained to me that everyone before me hadn't made quota.  I was hesitant, but took the job.  I worked very hard having facial days and educating each client that had time to listen.  I passed out samples with clear instructions.  But lastly, I wasn't able to make a strong enough impression om the public."
good,"A typical day at Dillard's Department Store for me involved interacting with cosmetic customers, performing make-overs and promoting my product line.   I have learned many new ways of using my product line to hone my skills in building multi sales.  The hardest part of my job is that I am an ambitious and high energy sales person and I would like to be able to serve more customers.   The most enjoyable part of my job is the meeting, greeting and serving new and repeat customers."
good,I loved working for Dillard’s it helped me a lot with my customer service and sales skills. The only thing is that I worked hard for a promotion to full time and they never took me into consideration knowing I was doing very good with my sales .
good,I did not mind working for this company while working there I met some great associates and management. The hours weren't bad while I was going to school and I also won awards and items when competing in events in our district. The location I was working at closed they even offered to work at another location but I thought it was time to move on.  And once again still keep in contact with co-workers I met while working there.
good,"easy going job "
good,loved learning about the fragrances and the new ones that came into the store it was really fun to dress up and look you best at work every day . I was fun going shopping on your break and finding great deals and to put on make up.
good,"great opportunities, great management  and good pay "
good,I love that job it thought me a lot and they gave me pay increase because I was making my numbers and I love the store. I just was working my way up to be a buyer but they keep it in the family.
good,"very friendly atmosphere. management was very nice offering full time hours , company offered many job placement opportunities within the company as weel as hire outside."
good,"A retail workplace unlike any other place I have worked before. The job was demanding, relaxing and unnerving at times but yet strict when not meeting the sales quotas  which resulted in New hires  constantly."
good,"Working at Dillard’s you have to be able to get people to sign up for there credit cards and be able to exceed your sales goal every day. To me it seems like that’s all they care about, they don’t care about making the customer happy."
good,It is a fun place to work and helped me grow in my experiences. The pay is decent depending on your department as well as the benefits they provide for their full time people.
good,"I enjoyed the merchandising work at Dillards. We would receive new clothes daily, and I would have to organize the floor pad and change the mannequins."
good,"Dillard's holds a slightly cutthroat environment. The main focus is meeting your sales goals, but that is sometimes a challenge. Dillard's does provide employees with videos for product knowledge."
good,"great co-workers"
good,"I delivered furniture, appliances  and electronics with in a 150 mile radius  of Amarillo, Texas. The furniture was very good but heavy and nearly always needed assembled some. People that cannot really afford to tip you always did and those that had money never did tip. Salesmen would promise the impossible. Dillards quite delivering and offered us jobs in the store as salesmen but I did want one then and went to work for the city."
good,"Dillards has a SPH salary for associates on the floor for selling. They taught me how to merchandise clothing and manage my time. The hardest part of my job is trying to help a customer that needs a piece of clothing and try to match what we done have in the store. A great day is helping people and there happy with the clothing we found for them. That they're happy with my customer service and mention it. ""Very rewarding' to say the least..."

good,"typical day at work was good. I learned alot of new things, the management was alright. the culture was fine. the hardest part of the job was the hours."
good,Start the day with a meeting.  recruiting customer for skin care.  the hardest part of the job is now to presell for different events.Getting customer to apply for Dillard's credit card.  In retail you get to meet a lot of people and a personal touch.
good,"I liked working for Dillard's for a little bit. Every morning we had a meeting with the manager of what there expectations were from us for the day, and any specials that might be going on as well. So that was nice. I was in charge of part of the women's department. So, they did encourage us to shop around and look at clothes while we were working, so that was nice. "

good,"I work in the cosmetics department as part time. The cosmetics department is one of the most competitive positions in the store. You really have to work to earn your customers and earn your place. There is high turnover due to the competitive, fast pace of this sales environments but if you work hard and care about doing well at your job, you will be fine here and it does pay off."
good,"Working at Dillards as a part-time was okay.   Within 6 months, I was promoted from Men's Sportswear to Men's shoes.   I enjoyed working at Dillards and receiving the discounts."

I was always excited to see what the next days work would bring."
good,Working a Dillard's was a part-time job while a student in college. I terminated the job due to relocating out of state. I recommend working at Dillard's.
good,Management is active and collaborative with all employees. Working in loss prevention with a great work ethic and making people feel safe and secure is what Dillards management desires. The most empowering part of my job was building honest relationships with my peers.
good,"Typical work day includes meeting customers and assisting them their completing their purchases.  The typical associate is also responsible for helping with managing product in-stock levels, maintaining a clean work area and participating and on-going training initiatives."
good,"I liked this job because it allowed me to be a little creative. The customers in Provo were kinda annoying. Sale goals are not too difficult to reach. I made really good friends. The managers are typically easy to work with. Plus, you get benefits after a month or so, I believe."
good,As the secretary it was very relaxed but I also had a lot to do. They expected me to be in customer service and a secretary at the same time. Would recommend to people who are in school.

good,A good job to work and good paid money I like the place because it was my first factory job and it was good money the only thing I did not like was standing for hours
good,Dillard's overall is a good place to work.  For hourly associates they have a SPH or sales per hour goal to meet which can make the environment between associates cut throat.
good,"This is a great job for anyone looking to pursue a career not just a job but a career in the cosmetic field. This job position will set you up for more than just selling makeup!

good,"Dillard's is very fast-paced.  You are required to meet a sales quota every day. Your job security depends on how well and how often you meet your sales quota.

good,"Dillards is a great company to work for. They pay awesome salaries and have good benefits to all employees. The only thing required of you is to meet your daily quota, which can sometimes be hard during certain seasons. I loved working for Dillards; the company really does take care of their employees."
good,not a bad place to work. The pay is good and co workers are friendly. Mangers aren't that bad and they are willing to and understanding when it comes to schedule changes.

good,"It wasn't really a fun job, but it could be fun at times depending on who you work with. Like I said before, it's mind numbing, but that's what you expect out of a warehouse job."
good,"Be on time"
good,"Dillard's is a competitive workplace with daily, weekly and monthly goals to meet. You are given a certain period of time to reach a goal which can determine your longevity with the company. However, you are also given a raised goal which is a nice compensation if you reach the goal. Also, they have opportunities for a fairly high discount. The cosmetic department is a world from which I learned a lot and enjoyed."
good,"I enjoyed working here since the pay was nice but also i like fashion so styling people was the best part of the job. you get an hour lunch so that was nice, on top of weekly pay every friday. The con is the unrealistic sales goals since dillards isnt the first place people go to shop and the #2 manager in my store was a heartless woman who had no idea how to speak to humans."
good,"A typical day at Dillards is being on ""floor"" constantly.  Greeting customers as they come into your department and assisting them with their purchase, to help them find the correct size.  Directing them to the dressing room and assisting them in trying on undergarments.  As a certified bra fitter this was very important."

good,"I started as a stock boy working for the holiday season. I was hired for seasonal work, but was kept on after the holiday season. I was then given a raise amd moved to the womens department as a stocker. After the position became obsolete instead of letting me go I was offered a sales position"

good,"Greet clients find out their needs and complete the attire with accessories.  Learning what the client needs and wants are something you can learn by listening. Learning about body style helps provide the best fitting outfit. Management is great and they work on the floor next to you. Co-workers have to make their sales goal too, so the floor is territorial.  The hardest part of the job could be making your sales goal, frustrating would be customers stealing or just throwing clothes on the floor of the dressing room. It is enjoyable to have a customer leave with an outfit they feel good in weather it is for a wedding or a funeral."

Christmas time I exceeded my quota easily, however come January and February they expected me to sell as much as I did in December which was not possible."
good,"There's nothing more stressful than needing to meet quotas or your job is in jeopardy. It's even worse when you're forced to work in a very low-traffic, low-sales part of a department when your supervisor knows full well that you will not be able to make your numbers. And then you're asked to put your two weeks in."

good,"Working here at my current job is great. From the 8 months i been here i learned that customers are our number one concern, we try our best to give great customer service and help them as much as needed. Co-workers are great here, love these people,have a great bond connection with lots of them, plus we work well as a team. Hardest part of the job is probably trying to return an item that has been bought online and is passed the due date with no receipt or proof of purchase. the most enjoyable would probably be clocking out for lunch break :)"

good,Upscale general merchandise retailer offering employees the change to advance. Diversified work environment that rewards employees based upon their performance.

Clean area, fold merchandise, scan and re-ticket merchandise, place sales on the front of area, assist customers with finding merchandise, order merchandise for customers, cash out customers by cash/ credit card/debit/ or personal checks, order area, clean dressing rooms, and balance cash register at end of shift. I learn how to multitask, and how to interact with customers of different characters. Management always had a plan to execute and during the day they made sure that every employee was on the same page. Management was always willing to teach, assist and to praise employees regularly. co-workers were great with assisting in any way. the hardest part of the job was the slow days. being busy assisting customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Working at Dillard's consist of engaging with guests, processing newly arrived merchandise, and plenty of interaction with fellow coworkers.  Hardest part of job is when there is slow traffic regarding customers and  reaching your sales target.  Most enjoyable part of job is the satisfaction you get from guests after you successfully fulfilled their request"
good,Sales associates at Dillard's are in charge of their own future and paycheck. They give multiple opportunities to get bonuses on each check and your pay depends on how hard you work. If you want more money per hour then you work harder to make sales.
good,Great fun place to work. has a tough quota system but its pretty much about being able to have great customer service and selling skills.
good,It was great until the manager quit and the new guy treated everyone like children and I called him out on it and quit. You work your buns off and money isn't too bad

good,"Enjoyable work environment with reasonable goals and expectations.   Management willing to reward hard work as well as guide employees in accomplishing set goals.

It was a good work environment, co-workers were friendly and helpful and working in women's shoes taught me patience and the true value of customer service.  We worked on commission, good and bad.  The bad thing was that when someone returned something, it counted against our commission.  I lost 10% of my wage due to not making my quota in commissions three months in a row.  Its no ones fault, customers liked to buy shoes for an event and then return them the next day alot of the times.  Thats retail for you, especially commissioned retail.  I wouldnt mind working commission again."
good,"Everyday I do about 60 orders and problems that have been returned to the warehouse. Everyone used to work well together until it was learned that we were overstaffed and some would have to leave. Then it became a goal to excel at your job and do whatever needs to be done.

On the weekly basis we reorganized products and maintained fitting rooms. Management was understanding and flexible, but when it came time to show discipline they were stern.

good,"Dillards was an empowering place to work as employees are given a lot of autonomy and the opportunity to grow pretty quickly if sales goals are maintained. A typical day consists of coming in counting down your registers and building a client base with each customer you assist. Its rather like owning your own little company within a company. Associates are in charge of stocking and maintaining case lines, opening credit lines, cross merchandising, and setting up displays to name a few.

But the most enjoyable part is the actual selling, helping a customer find the right products and ensuring that they are thoroughly satisfied. "

If you are able to relocate, advancement is even more likely. If my office was not closed due to downsizing I would still be working there."
good,Dillard's is a great company to work for if you are in college or retired and need a parttime job. It's a place where you learn the best customer service.
good,"The job was a very enjoyable working place but the work could get very busy at times."
good,"I enjoyed the pay but I hated that you MUST meet your sales quotas or in 90 days from being hired, if your sales are not looking right they let you go. I worked in the Juniors section, most of the time there is one more associate working with you. It makes the working environment with your coworkers very competitive because your job depends on each sale! It was really tough during the slow seasons"
good,"Dillard’s was a easy job, you picked up on everything fast and the you had to have customer service. Dillard’s also helped you stay on time with things because you had to be there at certain times"

good,"Dillard's is a great company to work for. I was a salaried manager and I could see me having a CAREER there. Hardest part of my job was leaving. I knew I was leaving something great behind, but what I learned is as long as you apply yourself daily it will not go unnoticed. Dillards thrives on success, dillards has great opportunities for anyone. typical day for me was coming into work, sitting and reading emails, and typing up a daily sales sheet, then i got out to the floor to conduct a morning meeting, I would help my associates with all of their floor moves, and coached in the moment to make sure they were staying on their toes on the sales floor. I ran a dept of 10+ associates and handled all their scheduling, daily meetings, executed markdowns, and had them run their own departments within our own dept."
good,Working at Dillards is fun and fair but only when your making ur number if not u always feel on edge. Besides that Dillard is a great place to look into.
good,"Look , Dillard’s is an amazing company but depending on the management it could be great or bad. The rest of the store is amazing, but if you can please avoid working in cosmetics. The ladies are so catty and just overall bad sports. Be careful who you confide in. It’s such a toxic community , no girl power whatsoever. It’s like high school all over again."
good,"Good place to Start. Good Benefits and Discounts. Very relaxed environment but management could be better, without good management a business can fall."
good,If you love retail Dillard’s is on of the best companies to work for. Wonderful  employee discount. Higher start pay than other retailers. And room to grow

She was very snobby and stuck up!!!!! Great people to work with, store manager was awesome, every other manager was amazing. I would go back in a heart beat."
good,It was a Good Place to Work. The only downside was that in the Position of Security Camera Monitor was limited to One Full-Time and Two Part-Time Positions. You would have to switch to another Department to get Full-Time. Probably in Sales.
good,"Sales Associate -Beauty Adviser in cosmetic from Chanel"

good,enjoyed the work and coworkers - management was very good about training and support. Working in a retail environment was extremely hectic during the Christmas holidays and when major sales were in progress.
good,"Dillards introduced me to more sales experience and helped me understand how to sell to different people. I was in the womens shoe dept. and that was a very different experience for me, but was great because I learned a lot. Would recommend to someone looking for a part-time job. Great discount!"
good,I learned that it is a great company to work for. Everyone is like family and there for each other no matter what. the hardest part of the job is opening credit card due to the fact that they either already have a Dillard card or they just don't want to open a card.
good,It was a fun place to work for. In some departments they have to make their quota if they don’t meet it they get a deduction from their during the yearly evaluation.
good,"you get hr at holiday time.but after that some time only 8-12 hr. depend on bussinees. so not fix income. manager,department manager and all staff are very nice."
good,"Loved the environment, great employees, and great training. I feel the company sets their employees up for success, straight forward with expectations, and meetings help keep everyone on the same page. I loved the set-up with management and the overall structure of the workplace. Only downfall is the stress of meeting a sales quota."
good,The Chandler location does not embody the norm of the Dillards culture. The pace was slow and many of the part time employees did not respect the culture of the company at a level I feel is professional or passionate.
good,"They pay very well, and have it setup to where it performance based pay. Not a very difficult job at all. The only downfall for me was the holiday season. If it wasn't for that I would continued working there"
good,"Lable boxes that came off of and assembly line in different parts of the warehouse, Then you would have to take them to various location with in the ware house to a truck to be loaded of to place on a shelf."
good,"The environment was great"
good,"This is probably the most competitive environment I've ever worked but it was also the most rewarding as well! Dillard's has strong Management and prides themselves as having the best customer service team around ,So don't expect to just smile and wave. Stay on your toes and off your phone!"
good,"It was a great experience , I love working there, the managers are excellence and professional. They were always willing to help and teach in any and everyway could."
good,"This is a great entry level sales position for anyone who is interested in getting into the business. for the most part it is pretty busy (dependent upon department), but there are times where you feel like you're taking the company's money because there are no customers and you sit there with nothing to do really which can get boring."
good,This was a wonderful work place.  Store Manager Was great.   This location closed.   I can not say enough good things about my time a Dillards.  I would work for them again.
good,I enjoyed my time at the Dillard's store level working and assisting the wide customer base that the store attracts. The hours and the training was great.
good,Dillard's has been such a good company to work for and they offer great benefits and fair hours. Customer service was always great and made for a good experience. It is a great place to work at if you want to learn how to socialize and work in teams. I would highly recommend this position to someone who is seeking a position working with people or want to have a laid back retail experience.

good,"I would assist people with finding the shoes necessary fit them and ring them up at our point of sale system. I learned a lot about dealing with different types of people and how they would react to different things. My direct manager was awesome to work for, him and I got along quite well. Dillard's culture was pretty good I felt I could have advanced there if I was to stay. The hardest part of the job was waiting around for people to come in. I found it interesting dealing with customers and resolving problems. I enjoy fixing issues people are having."
good,Great company to work for if you are retail and customer driven. The store carries wonderful and exclusive brands and is all about taking care of its customers! If you are interested in advancement the opportunities are endless for hard-working motivated employees.

I enjoyed meeting all the customers from across the world."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dillard's Distribution Center, because of the people I worked with they were like family. Management was fair and understanding when it came to time off."

After opening duties, if there is a truck to be delivered that day then it gets unloaded and the merchandise is to be organized then distributed to the according departments. Management was always friendly and helpful."
good,"The pay is not too bad, but work environment can get too competitive and full of drama"
good,I enjoyed working there although it required standing during the entire shift. I enjoyed meeting and assisting the customers and meeting the tourist from around the world.
good,Nice company to work for. New employees need to be trained more. Sometimes short staffed due to economy and less shoppers in the store so more staff is not needed.
good,I have made several employee friends at Dillards and have enjoyed working there for 2 years now. I have learned better communication skills and how to uncover the needs of customers. The hardest part of my job is meeting sales goals and also maintaining our credit application goals.
good,"Dillards was the first job I had as a manger, learned a lot about teaching and coaching staff.'"
good,"It was a pretty good job, while I was there I worked full time and had 2 days off, the employee discount was pretty good too, 25% off. I didn't think it was hard but it was a bit overwhelming whenever we got new merchandise in because we'd have to put it out pretty quick, but overall it was an easy job. Just cleaning out the fitting rooms and cash people out."
good,I worked in the Children's Department and the manager at the time was a sweet lady and always made sure her employees were taken care of. She was fair about time off and understood the importance of family.
good,Learning is an advancement on this job. My department is the team players of the store. We got everything done. The job is every easy but a lot of complains and come behind it. The job is less stressful but people makes your job very hard.
good,"There are weeks when you are very busy, and weeks when you are destined to clean the rails. There will be ample opportunity to learn other departments, as they will require your assistance in their production.

good,"It is a flexible, competitive, and easy going job. As long as you keep up with your sales you will be ok. You'll find some really good friends here. The management varies from store to store. The hardest is keeping up with your sales, but that is a debatable."

good,"-A typical day at work was giving great customer service & selling cosmetics."
good,"I loved working at Dillard's.  There was a family atmosphere where the associates cared about each other.  The only down side is that your sales goals are all that matter.  If you are making your sales you get to stay on board and work, if not you get fired."
good,"good place to work, pay is good except that you have to meet your quota . if not say goodby. that's the bad part.           I worked parttime"
good,"I really enjoyed working here, great environment, amazing management and staff. The work ethic was professional and interesting also."
good,"ok company"
good,The company has no organizational skills. In this company employees come to work when they get ready and when they are at work they are not performing. The company does not hold any employees to good work ethics
good,"I loved working at Dillards. I felt it was a family away from your own. Loved getting to know customers, I enjoyed coming to work every day managers were easy to speak with about your production and gave positive tips."
good,Dillards was a great place to work for learned a lot about rising fashion. The work environment of dillards is like no other everyone got along and management was there when you needed.
good,I liked the environment and the guaranteed hourly pay/schedule. It was 5-6 days a week and full time. I also like how management ran things.
good,"Dillards is a corporate company that own and manages several stores in the Southern Hemisphere of the United States.  During my time at Dillards, I have met a diverse group of people-- mainly Southerners.  I got accustomed to the culture during my 6.5 yrs of being stationed at Louisiana.  I enjoyed the warm and hospitable attitude that I got from the people that I worked with.  We had an excellent manager for our store in St. Vincent, Shreveport.  He made it enjoyable to come to work everyday.  He was very nice, accommodating and very dynamic.  Overall, I loved working with my clienteles (that I got to know and care for during the time I was there).  I made sure they were always taking care of, and in return, they would always come back looking for me to help them.  "
good,Dillard's is a good place to work because it is an institution that has been in business along time and great place to start a sales career.
good,At Dillard's it is always something new to do even if it is the same concept it is still a new task. One thing that aways kept me going were the customers from seeing new faces come in to seeing smiling faces leaving i enjoy being able to help people with what they need.
good,"Coaching and training cosmetic associates"
good,Typically I would come in to work with a smile and greet each customer. I tell them information about the merchandise. I size the children if need be. I also use my awesome customer service skills to correct or satisfy customers who have come in with damaged or defective merchandise. I am there to collect payments on accounts. I handle large amounts of cash. I answer phone calls and I also make out-going phone calls to other stores to track merchandise and I sometimes make online purchases for home-bound delivery. I unload and clean stock room when needing maintenance. I make sure the product is presentable and ready to buy.
good,Sold Estee Lauder products on a daily basis.  Would answer questions and provide demonstrations of products by giving a facial.  The hardest part of this job were the holidays when new product packages came out and we were expected to maintain a customer list of (ex:) Christmas package with product orders.  My co-workers and I did very well at this and often assisted each other as requested.  Managers were encouraging but gave useful instruction as/if needed.  Because of classes given by Estee Lauder I was able to learn about and appreciate their beauty products and a deeper appreciation of the beauty industry as a whole.
good,"The at days Dillard's are mostly spent assisting customers with purchases and questions about products . I learned how to better interact with customers and upsell products. Management was awesome with scheduling and flexibility. Coworkers were fun and interesting with so many different types of personalities it made a very diverse group. The hardest part of the job was that every month was that you only got one weekend off. The most enjoyable part by far, was the daily interaction with customers."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dillard's because coworkers and management were fun to work with and supportive of advancement and flexibility. However, management wouldn't allow me to go on my  ten day church trip without firing me so I had to quit and they asked me to reapply when I got back. I won't reapply but I don't regret working there and would suggest it to anyone with a heart for service."
good,"A day in ladies shoe is hard work, but fun. I got the chance to inter act with co-workers and customers at same time on sale floor, showing shoes suggesting the best fit and style. The hardest part of the job was making sure the stock room was in ease to locate  the merchandise by size and color."
good,"Help  out the  Client  and  work  to  maintain  a month  sales  quota."
good,I worked with customer to find out what they were looking for to make the perfect outfit. Provided excellent customer service. We worked for a daily sales goal everyday so there wasn't much team work in the environment. I learned how to deal with difficult customers and make sure that their visit to our store was satisfactory.
good,"At the time of my being employed by the company, everything was so fulfilling. I was able to manage my home life and work life with ease. There were rarely any complications on the job. Everyone had great communication with one another, which allowed for a smooth running company and work flow."
good,"The military has its pros and cons, but I talk more on the pros of my military service. I enlisted in March 2005 and have been serving since then and I have met fabulous people, have developed skills that will help me in a civilian job. I have obtained professional degrees with the military's financial help, and much more!"
good,"1.The work environment is very professional. "
good,"Typical day at work would include serving customers, opening and closing registers. Keeping display up to date. Keeping the back of the stock room clean in your designated area. I learned about more ladies shoe brands and the different style of shoes there are. The hardest part of the job can be keeping up with the trends. Most enjoyable part of my job can be seeing and speaking to different people throughout the day and meeting their needs so they can leave out of the store satisfied and understanding each individual sense of style."
good,"The daily tasks of a sales associate are somewhat challenging but fun. Keeping customers happy is your number one goal. Along with satisfying shoppers in your area, you must keep your registers and dressing rooms free of mess. We are often putting out new clothing and marking down older things, so there is almost always something fast-paced going on. Management in my store is absolutely wonderful. They are all very helpful, as are my many amazing co-workers. I would have to say that the toughest part of the job is keeping my sales up to quota. Sometimes you just have one (or five) of those days where no one comes in to buy! You just have to keep on moving because everything else about this job is absolutely stunning. The pay, the benefits, and the hours are all perfect for my needs."
good,"very competitive  hard working team environment."
good,My manager asked to punch in early to help with the general merchandise trailer very easy day.My co-workers all chipped in to help with the trailer very team work oriented
good,My co workers are all easy to gt along with.The hardest part of the job is when customer approach you in a very rude manner.Everyday is working as a challenge. And we always learn something out  from that mistake.Dealing with a lot of people is not easy but  with perceiverance everything is possible.
good,Good pay for working retail. A lot of selling and working with the public. Coworkers and management are nice for the most part. Hardest part of job is working retail hours and standing for long periods of time.
good,"It is an overall nice place to work. I learned how to make my sales goals, etc. Management was descent."
good,"Excellent pay, great management team, fun work environment."
good,my day starts of sometimes with opening the store and picking up clothes that the customers may have dropped on the floor. I would put merchandise back in the appropriate spot where it belongs. my co workers are very friendly and my managers are awesome.
good,"Every day is different depending, on stocks, mark downs and sales. The company could be very successful if they had a little more employee appreciation. I have been there 4 years, my mom has been a store manger at another location for 25 years. I know a lot about the company. Just the way they do raises is one example it is based on sales goals which can be good but they also take away sales and returns. They don't do it based on work ethic so some people can walk around or stand by the register all day and do nothing and make there sales.But the fact is If I'm getting paid and there is stock, mark downs, displays, and organization, restocking, as well as helping customers I am going to do it. And I get taken advantage for it. It allows others to get away with minimum. I have done  everything and worked my way up I know all stock, return and management policies. Where most of my co workers ask me, before a manger and I do all task as a manger but do not get acknowledgement for it. All stores are different I actually have mentioned acknowledging things done by employees, to my mother who is a store manger and she has now less turn over rate. The  hardest part would say I work with much more mature ladies who just are  waiting till their retirement and it makes my job harder because some will follow directions where, others have just checked out. Over all benefits are good paid vacations depending on how long you worked there, birthday payed for. If you work a holidays ts time and half plus another paid day off, and health care benefits."
good,Love everyone I worked with. Would love to eventually go back. Love the atmosphere and how everyone steps up to help coworkers in personal times of need
good,Great opportunity to work in a competitive environment with other sales associates
good,I was an intern for this company in the summer of 2009. I was faced with many different experiences and challenges on a daily basis. The job was rewarding and the store manager was cheerful and always helpful.
good,"I loved working for Dillard's. I met a lot of amazing and sweet people  that I will never forget! Managers were awesome! Our store was always on our game. Great presentation and great employees! The only problem was their weren't very many customers, and with a high sales quota it's hard to make ends meet. I just didn't feel like I would always have a job there. It was unsettling, so I began searching for new experience in a different field."
good,Dillards is all about knowing your latest fashion trends. The costumers you have want whats hot now so its good to know. The management staff if very friendly and make the store a great place to shop and work. Your always gonna meet the best people as your co-workers there. At this location some of them have been there for over 20 years! The job tends to get hard over holidays because it stay consonantly busy but it defiantly rewards in your pay.
good,"Learned about merchandising, marketing, planning and promoting new products and scheduling and coordinating special events."
good,"I was a specialist in one of the private brand departments for Dillards and I loved my jobs. I had to make sure the sales floor looks presentable at all time, work on my daily and weekly sales goals, keep track of inventory and make sure my customers had the best shopping experience. Management will be a little hard on the associates form time to time, but you will be fine as long as you provide great customer service and stay on top of your sales goals."
good,I had a blast working in the Cosmetic/Fragrance isle at the store. I loved working with all the cosmetic employees. I had a knac for up-selling. I learned how to really make people smile and feel that this is crucial to obtain good customer service. I enjoyed the company of my co-workers and we worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was inventory nights and I enjoyed the customers!
good,I really enjoyed working for Dillards. The people at this store in Tyler Texas are awesome people to work for. The Home Store Mgr I really enjoy working with him. Learned alot from the Home Store Mgr. Great experience in solving customer issues. Dillards have a great management team at Tyler Texas.
good,Make sure have smile all the time. Understanding a people mind are so complicated.But serving customer with smile make good day for them.Make sure all items replaced right place. Have a conversations with co work so we could understand each other. Customers telling me I helped so much and thank me.
good,Most days are busy
good,Like to wrk with people that like to work together and help each other when it comes to work.
good,"I worked at Dillard's in Stonecrest Mall, a typical day for me was dealing with a variety of people. I helped customers find clothing and any other items they may have needed, even if it was in a different department. I was a sales associate and was mainly working the registers a good part of the day. I learned that as a sales associate you have to be prepared for anything, an angry customer, rude comments, and your workplace quickly becoming dirty. I worked in a competitve environment and my co-workers had a lot more experience than I had. I enjoyed working with them but when it was time to make a sale they would do anything and everything they had to in order to get it. The hardest part of my job would have to be keeping up with the quarterly quota, everyday I was switched to a different department and was expected to make sales even if there were not any customers. It was extremely hard when there were not any customers coming into the store at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people everyday, as mentioned before I worked in a mall."
good,I was hired of a salon coordinator and was promoted to the retail advisor after a year. There are several stylists so there are phone calls and walk-ins constantly. Youust be fast paced and have exceptional communication and multi-tasking skills to do well here.
good,Enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them with purchases while putting a smile on their faces.
good,"I loved working for this company, it was fun. You meet a lot of new people work with a lot of amazing customers."
good,"If you love helping customers, enjoy making people happy and satisfied then this is the job for you! Everyday is a challenge to talking to customers, checking customers out, ordering items online, making customers feel comfortable and relax. Never bring your problems to work unless you want a bad day at work. Working in the office is one of the hardest jobs at a retail office but you have to enjoy, make it fun but professional the same time."
good,It's a highly competitive job that beats all other Retail with their great pay and wonderful benefits. Vacation pay with asked vacation dates twice a year.
good,Working at Dillards is SUPER easy. i was able to communicate to customers all day and come up with new ideas for new merchandise. The hardest part was making more room for new brands.
good,"The years that I was working there I never had a problem,  great management and flexible hours. Always trying to help me and give me good advise, and great co-worker"
good,"I loved Dillards 1 of my Favorite places to work and shop, 8 helped customers , meet a lot of customers, would get my mark downs done as fast as possible"
good,Great company however the atmosphere was too competitive to the point That customers became uncomfortable due to noticing the conflict between the employees. Generic sales quota that wasn’t realistic for every department.
good,Dillard is family oriented. Everyone works together even under stress the calls might be. Calls could be slow and some days fast paced calls come through
good,"its like any retailer, not enough time to spend with the family and I enjoyed working with my superiors, colleagues and customers."
good,Dillards department store offers a great work environment and other perks that make it a good place to work. My time there was short because of relocation but I would love to work for them again.
good,"Dillard's Distribution Center in north Fort Worth had a good workplace environment at the time I worked there. Horseplay was not allowed, but you could still have fun."
good,"Most of the weekdays were very slow due to the location. But, the weekends saw the most action, like, there would be a constant flow of customers. Most of which were very familiar with our store and our weekly deals. So, that was always a nice feeling knowing the regulars. Anyway, I learned how to operate a register and how to deal with other transactions, because, I spent most of my time there. It also gave me some more experience dealing with customers face to face. So, dealing with the angry ones were particularly tricky. But, I've already dealing with that aspect having been a Security Officer."
good,"I loved comimg too work each day, I jist wish they paid a little more for the work we did. The supervisor was awesome I would work tjere again. There's nothing else too say😃"
good,"My typical work day: Greeting & educating guest about different vendor products. Helping guest making final decision on purchase. Received monies for purchase. Found solutions for guest returning  products. Stocked product & kept showroom organized & clean. "
good,I started on the production floor and was promoted to Data Entry within 6 months. I enjoyed the work very much.  The work environment was a bit stressful.
good,This was a summer internship requirement to graduate college. I spent 10 weeks learning how to manage a department and got to see the day-to-day work required of a manager.
good,Great work place with little to none flaws. Excellent training for customer service and the management is beyond fair. Keep up the great work? I love dillards so much!
good,"A good company to grow with, promote from within. Competitive pay starts at $10 per hour and if you exceed sales quotas you get a $1 raise every year."
good,I started out on the sales floor. Moved up to management quickly. I was always busy and worked well with the staff. Opened  and closed the store. Our store had many departments and the managers were responsible for all departs as a team.
good,"I really loved working for Dillard's; however, the management team is poor. I got let go for working TOO HARD. I came in for people that never showed up and stayed longer when other employees were late, but the manager never changed my schedule, so it showed that I was way over in my hours."
good,"Working with a large, diverse group of people was definitely interesting. Management can be quirky, young and prideful. Guidelines, goals and positions changed daily."
good,A typical day at work would be when everything is slow and your just stocking merchandise trying to make sales to meet your daily sales goals. The workplace culture is mostly fashion and the new trends/what's popular in season. Usually very quiet and on speacial events you can sale anything in the store. Hardest part of the job is louring customers in to applying for a Dillard's credit​ card.
good,"Dillards provided opportunity for advancement.  There was a lot of room for advancement if you were willing to relocate to another city.  "
good,Fun professional environment to work. All my co-workers were very open and helpful when i started and always got monthly review on what improved and what still needs some work.
good,I loved working for Dillard's!!  It was so much fun.  I started working for them in Miami and transferred to Shreveport.  It's a great place for a second job or full time with room to move up.
good,"The benefits are lacking, but the staff and management are exceptional.  A typical day consists of making room for new stock, marking down older stock and fitting women in the correct bra for a more flattering wardrobe, this last part being the case since I work in the Intimate Apparel Department."
good,Dillard's has a unique way of customer service. Employers are to get to know the customer as you give customer service. It is a lot of pressure because meeting the daily sales was hard and if sales were not done you had only one month to bring them up or else your work was terminated.
good,"The best things about working for Dillards is that you get a lot of benefits. For example, when you are already a Dillards employee you'll be the first to see the new merchandise, you know when the promotions begin, your awesome Dillards employee discount, your lunch break hour, holiday pay, vacation, and my favorite of them all. being at home with your family on holidays!"
good,"A typical day at Dillard's consist of cleaning , getting in hold with the customer. Building relationship with the customers and making their day is the goal of the day . There are also personal sale goals that we have to reach by recruiting and inviting back our customers."
good,"Occasionally, there were fast past working days. Slow days meant finding something to keep you busy. The learning experience from this company was the maintaining high sales is tough. The management team was great. They were understandable as long as you tried to do your job. Coworkers were friendly and professional. The hardest part of the job was meeting sale quotas. The easiest part of the job was that there was always something to keep you from being bored."
good,"The pay was decent and the work was hard but I learned fast enough to keep up with the fast paced environment. A typical day consisted of lifting materials and food, cleaning, speaking to new people at every function and practicing respectable workmanship. The co-workers left me to do most work because I was the youngest but I speak up for myself while getting my job done so that did not remain an issue for long. The most enjoyable thing would be smelling the food and serving smiling faces."
good,I loved everything about this job. I would clock in  clean up my display area and stockroom. After everything was ready and the cash draws were open it was time to sell. which by the way was my favorite part. i liked interacting with the customers and helping them out with really finding a great shoe. i was the top sales person  in the shoe department and always had a big monthly bonus checks. I was so fast and accurate with markdowns and inventory I was always picked to do them . I didnt mind at all cause then i knew what the deals were and i could let me customers know also.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. I liked the challenge of sales goals and coming to work and helping customers with shoes. I loved my manager and my associates.
good,"This is a fairly decent job treated with respect with mostly great management. The main issue is overstaffing while having goals that make it hard for everyone reaching their sales goals during the slow seasons.Overall, it is enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work for flexible schedules. great management, high energy . great co -workers. hardest part is making sales goals"
good,The job was fairly easy. You would come in most days and just stand and walk up to customers and ask if they needed help.  The weekends were the busiest days.
good,"Working for Dillard's is an experience that I am pleased to have gotten. I advanced fairly quickly from Sales Associate to Selling Specialist to Selling Business Manager of Intimate Apparel to finally reaching Sales Manager of the home and children's dept. Work was very busy. I was responsible for 5 employees goals, sales, schedules, and coaching. The hardest part of my job was the uncertainty of work days/hours. There were many times I worked open to close and six day work weeks due to surprise corporate visits. I learned how to be a manager. I've learned to balance my work and home life the best I can. I've learned how to be a team leader and coach associates."
good,"In a typical day associates arrive 15 minutes before the store opens and proceed to clean their designated area. Then, I would normally hand over perfume samples on a piece of paper in order to attract customers. One or two makeups were done per day. Also, I made phone calls to previous customers to remind them of an event or just to ask if they were satisfied with their purchase and for this activity I use the CAT system to take notes about customers responses and appointments. Make sales, reorder my booth and close the register. Moreover, I had to keep track and order any product needed to cover my inventory. Finally, associates help rearrange other departments of the store before clocking out."
good,"Customer and goal-oriented company."
good,"Typical day at work consists  putting away merchandise, sales. recover the area. "
good,"Every day at Dillards was something new. There was always a great deal of work to be completed, but it kept the day going by smoothly. Stock room cleaning and preparation, advertisement and marketing changes, up-selling credit card applications and extra shoe care supplies, and great customer service. I learned at Dillards to keep moving at all times. Even if there were no customers there was plenty extra work to be done within eight hours. Management was okay, they did their job. My co-works were great. When you have 20 or more associates your days can be very fun. The Hardest part of the job I would say would be quota because with so many associates it can be hard when there are few customers. The most enjoyable time would be the time spent with my co-workers."
good,"Dillard's was a very great job , the pay was great  the environment was nice and the customers were very friendly. My co workers were very sweet people they helped out  a lot when I had questions about things I was uncertain about. The hardest part about the job is staying very calm during a rush it gets pretty crazy during the holidays but i maintained my composure. The most enjoyable thing about the job was getting a nice one hour break and that we were able to discuss things with our managers without feeling uneasy."
good,"I really enjoyed working there .The discount was awesome , but the expectations are kinda ridiculous. it was hard to make my sph ( sales per hour) , i had a higher sph then people who had been there for 4 years . It did not make sense"
good,great company to work for keeps yu busy and motivated to move up or out the best part about the job is the customers
good,"worked in the make-up department, was a wonderful place. Learned about make-up and skin care"
good,"Great pay, I liked to keep myself busy creating outfits on my downtime. The best thing is you get to use your creativity and socialize with the customers. Coworkers can get competitive and try to steal your sales."
good,"It a fun place to work,there is room for advancement through all levels.Marketing strategy is the key to Dillards that allow the company to be successful in many areas. Overall marketing the best apparel in the market of clothing."
good,"I was making ten bucks an hour back in 2005, starting. The pay was great. For the short time I was there, I had great training and became a bra fitting specialist. Management was great at my store, but my store was also painfully slow business-wise and closed a few years later."
good,The workers was good and nice. Very clean eniorment for the coustomers to come and shop.
good,I really enjoyed working here because i was able to socialize as well as help people to get there fashion needs met.
good,"A differernt challenge on a daily basis to obtain the highest sales goal, Building your sale percentage at your own pace. Being courtesy to customer and co-workers as well ,maintaining a professional manner at all times.Enjoying the grand feeling after completing a huge sale and a approved credit applicantion."
good,Dillard’s is a great company that I like working for cause of the environment and the professional customer service I love dealing with customers  every day .
good,"Working at Dillard's I've learnt how to provide great customer service, being multitasking and achieve my work goals. Also they offer competitive salary."
good,"This a very good job to work to because it helps develops you. they provide safe environment for workers , also worker compensations.they do care about their customer."
good,"Attend morning meeting, receive sales goals for the day, call customers to inform them of upcoming events and new sales, organize the sales floor and greet every customer. "
good,Loved working with new clients and getting to know them. Made lots of life long friends. Sales experience grew tremendously as I met goals. Product knowledge grew as I learned from others and taught new consultants.
good,The people I worked with were fun and professional. Management was great until a new store manager came in and turned everything around. The pay is good and they work with students school schedule and your overall life schedule.
good,"Should offer commission to all sale employees. "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dillard’s and even though my time was cut short (medical issues) I did like the perks of working there. We had many opportunities to get incentives (free products, gift cards, free lunch). We were like a family. Did charity events (such as raise money and canned foods for Puerto Rico). Working the register was a little confusing at first but once you learn it, it becomes your best friend and you often use the register for almost everything (client logs, training, emails, online orders). The downside was probably the sales goals. Often times the goals were too high (during the week when the mall was dead) no one shops in stores like they use to and it was extremely hard to get in more traffic. Example: if your goal for the day was $1000 and you missed it by $400 that 400 goes toward your next day goal which makes that day even harder. You accumulate so much sometimes that your sales may sometimes end up to -3000 or higher which makes some people stress out."
good,"At Dillards, I learned how to sell and customer service. I had many opportunities to learn new fields, and they also offered classes for beauty in the section of work I was working which was very hepful."
good,Loved working here up until the point of my hours being cut. Great environment with awesome workers. Management could get lost at times but they always seemed to have everything together and we got things done on time.
good,"Dillard's is an awesome company to work for. They offer a competitive wage, much higher starting rate than most places, with easy opportunities for raises, bonuses, and advancement. Easy to build relationships with regular customers, and build your own clientele database. Excellent benefits, and perks available too!"
good,I enjoyed the work I did. I was able to move freely and work on my investigative skills. My biggest goal was ensuring the safety of the customers and employees during business hours.
good,"great people to work with, fun atmosphere, great benefits, challenging, rewarding, able to advance if you work hard and prove yourself"
good,"A typical day at Dillard's would start with communicating with managers and other sales associates in my department to see what needed to be done that day. Juggling projects, customer-service, and keeping the department clean comprised the majority of the day. While at Dillard's, I learned enhanced communication skills to help in handling customers and co-workers efficiently in a professional environment. "
good,"Dillards was an awesome place to work as a full time student. "
good,"I was always ready to sell the most I could every day that I went in. I learned great customer service, in learning how to talk to them and say the knowledge I knew about what i was selling. My coworkers were always very helpful and ready to work. I was sometimes unable to reach the number I wanted for the day but that always made me more ready for the next time. I loved informing people with things I knew that they didn't and they were always so thankful."
good,"Dillard""s a great company to work for your able to grow, manage your time wisely. Move up in the company the pay is good. One on one with your customer as if your their personal shopper."
good,Dillard's is a great company to work for but if you're looking move up very fast in a company it's rare that it happens with them they seems to actually be downsizing rather than expanding at the moment.
good,"Dillard's was an awesome working experience. The environment fun, friendly, and outgoing. over all the company is very understanding and is always ready to work with you"
good,"Sales Associate Cosmetics & Fragrances Department"
good,"we started everyday with a team meeting to get everyone on track. There was never a doubt about what was expected. The staff and manager were all easy to get on with. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The people really made the place, the clients were always pleasant, and the associates were just as nice."
good,"A typical day at work is starting by greeting everyone with a smile, counting the money, make sure MIDD orders and Send orders are prepared to send out, Assisting any customers with refunds, sales, or wrapping presents. I learned a lot about the cash register, because I had never worked with one before. My co-workers are very friendly and willing to help at any capacity. The hardest part of my job is the customers not being patient when it is time to wrap a present for them. The most enjoyable part of my job is everything about my job. I love dressing up and preparing for work. I love the office environment and being friendly to everyone."
good,"The pay was pretty good considering that it was a retail job. My coworkers were great. We instantly became good friends. The job was pretty easy. I worked in the children's dept, and I was a cashier."
good,Dillards work is not hard yet its fun. You must love to work with customers and be people friendly.
good,awesome opportunity for career advancement you can be cross trained and allowed to use your sales skills all around the store. Very competetive environment and professional standards.

good,I loved everyday at Dillards.  Great people to work with. Management always in tune with employees. Lots of benefits given to employees through the year. Flexible work times to make the job easy to fit your life.
good,Dillards provided an excellent place to work because the customer service team provided a great place for consumers to shop.  The pay is above average in the areas that Dillards operates.
good,"A typical day at Dillard's would be  pretty even paced so I would get to complete all my tasks, then get busy by the end of the day  when its close to closing time. Management was pretty nice and understanding. Most of  my coworkers were very friendly and helpful ."
good,"Team members were good to work with. The supervisor was professional and fair to all of the employees. Work hours were good, and we were always able to take breaks and lunch hours."
good,This is a warehouse job where it is possible to climb the ladder fast. Work hard and you can work overtime as well. The pay was excellent and so where the people I worked with.
good,"Face to face sales, run the register, more self motivated and work solely alone."
good,I had so much fun working there I always meet new people and always helped customers out finding what there looking for
good,"The day starts with getting registers opened and area ready for customers. putting strategy together to exceed daily sales goals. I have learned how to meet the need by listening to customers and helping them to have a great shopping experience than the last. Management helps you to grow, I have always met my sales goals, no matter how hectic it was. My co-workers are different and from all walks of life. I really enjoy most of them. The hardest part is a slow day when few people are shopping. Most enjoyable is when you connect with a customer and they really appreciate your recommendations for them and they keep coming back to you!!"
good,"I enjoyed working for them . They are very structured and well managed . The associates were usually always nice and pleasant.The hardest part of the job was probably cold calling for business when times might would be slow on a snow day or something. The most enjoyable part for me was trying to create excitement at counter with different themes to not be the dull or usual, of course it was hard work but it generally paid off in sales ."
good,I worked at Diallard's in the womens shoe department and i absolutley loved it! Management and everyone was nice! The only downfall was they overhired to many people so i wasn't get enough hours.
good,"I enjoyed this job. I made the best out of it like I’ve made the best out of them all. I enjoy constantly moving around & on that job, I did just that"
good,"Started my day with organizing perfumes,making my quota calculations to beat my goal and achieve great numbers.At the end of the day will check inventory and report to manager on duty to clock out."
good,Great place to work hard to meet sales quota but fun environment fun people also rude but pay no mind to them just yourself and everything will be cherry
good,"I really enjoyed the job culture at Dillard's. the managers and co-workers were a delight to work for. They offer many incentives, bonuses and opportunity for promotion."
good,I loved working for Dillard's. I was a sales associate in the lingerie department and soon after hire I was selected to become a certified bra fitter! I loved dressing up everyday and seeing all the new merchandise!
good,It is a family owned business. Wonderful people that I worked with. I loved that I was able to have relationships with the people that came into the door
good,Working at Dillard's taught me how to definitely up sale expensive things and also build a great relationship with our customers so they'll want to come back and always shop with you. It also taught me how to approach people in a mannerly way.
good,"Typical day at Dillard I count the registers, and online orders before we open. Once the doors are open we help customers and serve them as needed. What I have learned most is keep a positive attitude even on my bad days. Far as management goes, it could be better when it comes to organization. I really enjoyed my co workers everyone had a positive attitude. The hardest part of my job is doing stock and keeping everything clean and working as a team.The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers."
good,"We go into work, we check in the stock room for stock usually we do an hour of freight, Then depending on which department we will go on to the floor and sell to customers until the end of our shift."
good,I enjoyed selling products and learning new things. The job providedgood incentives if you sold a certain amount of product which made you want to strive for better sales.
good,"A typical day at work included cash bag pick-up from customer service, verification of exact money that remained in the drawer from the prior business day. Sale specific merchandise to meet the store and department quota. Exercise appropriate customer service. Ordering, transferring, stocking, and merchandising shipment."
good,There is very little compenstion for extra effort. I did love my job at Dillard's because it was not like any other position in the company. I could use my creativity on many levels.
good,"Working at Dillards was a very fun job, but the sales quota was difficult to meet with management constantly pressuring more and more. The atmosphere was fun and lively"
good,I liked working here. I love to engage with the customers. I love being able to shop for customers and help them find what they need. You can build up your own clientele and call them and give them personal messages let them know about upcoming sales wish them happy birthday. You have a sales quote to meet everyday. Which sucks some days. Your quota lays on your job security. Have to make that quota everyday if you want to keep your job. They are all about their sales.
good,Dilliards is a entry level position. Its a better fit for a younger individual. The most difficult task of the job is trying to do more than one person job at a time. The reason it's like that is because they refuse to put enough employees on the schedule.
good,hanging freight and taking with customers i learned how to be a good customer service rep management was ok she helped out when needed it was a temporary job i only help when needed
good,"its a great retail job, great pay but very competitive sales position. There are many customers divided into each section. You must drive sales in this environment. Be prepared to own the sales floor with your amazing sales pitch."
good,"Not really very flexible in scheduling.  I would say there is a 2% chance for promotion, even though they do try to promote from within.  Sales Managers get their butts kicked daily with a lot of work, and little to no help or support from upper management.  Usually, nothing is good enough for upper management."
good,Everyday you will have to run another co-worker to get to help a customer to make a sale for commission.
good,"i worked as selling kids shoes then promotted to ladies shoes, worked on computer registers,did inventory, merchadising, organising."
good,"Pays great, friendly people to work with.  Training for a certain job to help you move up or improve you job status.  Help improve self motivation and help with self esteem."
good,"Very competitive environment "
good,"Dillard's is a great company! Management and appreciation for associates, not so great. My customers are the only reason why I stay with the company as long as I have. Job environment is great as well as my coworkers."
good,"Accurately maintain and balance registers. Managed cashiering activieties in areas of purchasing, returns and exchanges, and enforced store policies. Ensure that each customer receives exceptional service by providing a friendly, environment and personalized assistance."
good,ok place to work must be a hard sales person. must be very flexable because the shifts are crazy. Must be a strong person
good,"overall,it was a good job, but I screwed it up. I mean,i use to use drugs and they wanted people that didn't and I failed a random drug test. It was a good job, with good advancements, and the people in it were nice also, but I Freaked it up."
good,Working at Dillard's the most enjoyable part of my work day is when I arrive before opening and it's quiet and dark. It helps me relax more and get comfortable with my surroundings.
good,a typical day consisted of pricing products. organizing merchandise.great people to work with. breaking down displays and putting up new ones. cashiering.
good,Fun place to work. Pay not where it should be and management lacking direction. Management deceptive about rules and regulations. Company should be willing to hire enough staff to manage call volumes without affecting clerks.
good,This company was great at training and motivating employees. It does require employees to meet and maintain sales goals and this can be hard at certain times of the year. Great quality goods.
good,Great Environment where employees worked together. It is a very profitable Business with luxury high end items. As a employee we got amazing discounts.
good,"supportive atmosphere with a supportive management team. . Great relationship with fellow employees. Feels warm,loving,and supportive from management and emplyee standings."
good,this place made me understand and respect the everyday grind of some people. i learned how to work fast keep my mind on track and still be able to be patient with a customer.
good,"Dressed up everyday and went in there with a good attitude to get sales. Fold clothes and also fixed anything in my area that needed to be fixed. Goal was to bring in more sales you did then last month to increase your pay. "
good,Management was really bad. Wish they have done things differently. It was great pay and great benefits. I remanded it to a friend but working in another store.
good,"I would Count the register as soon as I got there in the morning made sure it was correct. Then I would check my area pick up anything was left on the floor, just really tidy up before customers came in. I would help customers find clothes for any occasion that they where shopping for. I learned that you have to keep up with customers and able to adapt to different personalities in less than five minutes.Management was very understanding when it came to schedule changing or having people call in. The hardest part of the job was really just trying to help every customer you could. If your sales went down it reflected bad on you, so you would have to be on the go constantly. I really do miss meeting new people everyday, I would get filled with joy when I would talk to a customer and they open up to you, it would always make my day."
good,"I enjoyed the customers and assisting them in their purchase needs. I enjoyed merchandising the new clothing, and watching the customers face light up when new clothing was present in a very appealing way."
good,"I learned many thing from this position including but not limited to customer service, markdowns, markups, store layout and placing items where it appeals the customers."
good,"A typical day at work we had to great each customer and assist them. I've learned that i am a lot more personable than i thought and i am very good at multitasking, especially when it came down to me assisting more than one customer at a time. My coworkers and i got along great, everyone looked out for each other (most of the time). The most enjoyable part of the job is that they didn't open too early neither close too late."
good,i was a opener there so i opened registars pretty much alone all the time i worked in kids department and theres like 6 registars to open. had to meet a sales goal every day which i caught on pretty quickly.the managers at dillards act like they care but really dont they are just really fake.my coworkers were great  very competitive enviroment and its hard to make sales when there is like 8 people in one department and the full time hours basically have you scheduled all day morning to close. and part time hour suck and at dillards your not allowed to get much over time.
good,"A typical day was markdowns, put new merchandise on the floor, move apparel around so that the newest was on the aisle. Helped consumers select items, order items or return items. Always provided great customer support. "
good,I really enjoyed being a sales associate at dillards....It was a good atmosphere to work in and the pay was excellent
good,I enjoy Dillards vvery much. It is a wonderful company . The staff is great I am ready for a change and would love to work with people. 
good,Wake child up and prepare him to go to school. Pick him up take him to practice. Come home feed him and tutor him. Get him ready to spend time with his family when his parents come home from work.
good,The typical day was assisting customers on the sales floor with merchandise and inquires.
good,a typical day at dillards lady shoes dept would be coming in and opening the registers merchadizing and helping all customers. I would also unload stock when it would come in. I really enjoy working with the public and would say i have great people skills.
good,Working retail for a large chain department store was very interesting as you deal with many different types of people with many different tastes and preferences
good,It's a pretty good place to work at they're pretty strict about their employee being on time address of a business related also they like their employees to smile a lot
good,I absolutely loved it at dillards. Great people and lots of continuous training. Would work here again if i didnt have small children. Lots of management opportunities!
good,"Estabilidad en el horario. Ofrecen horas extras si lo deseas. Además, si trabajamos en un horario muy pesado, como los días festivos o de descanso, el almuerzo es proveído, y dependiendo de la ocasión, el pago es considerado como día festivo, más un día libre pago como festivo también, lo cual es excelente."
good,Overall I was really pleased with the company. The atmosphere was proffesional and the pay was good. The management was fair and the employee's were kind.
good,enjoyed my work as a sales associate and learned some of the management skills and customer service. Taking care of the customer was the firsts priority in this job and I did it.
good,It's a place were you have an opportunity to grow or move around different departments. If you are a student they work with your school schedule......
good,"Busy store with a great hardworking  staff.  Shifts are between 7:30 - 8 hours long. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the various customers, who, for the most part, are very nice."
good,"If you don’t like working don’t work at Dillard’s. Very time consuming and competitive! Although the staff is very friendly , a second family to most of us."
good,"it s  great place i just need to get more hours for my bills, and a full time position if possible, ive been with this company for about 21 years and just looking to further my chances in hetting more hrs as stated before i just need a full time job"
good,I enjoyed the ability to start at an entry level position and move up after years of service.  I worked in different departments throughout my time with them.  I enjoyed working in the Men's Department assisting then purchasing clothing for all occasions.  The benefits and employee discount was a great perk.
good,I learned how to talk more to customers. I learned more about how it is to be a leader. The hardest part is finding something to do when there are no customers and everything in the are is clean.
good,You gain a lot of product education and enchance your skills in customer service 1 on 1. For the most part their working hours are very flexible but weekends and late shifts are common.
good,If you are looking for a great paying job and you are a great sales person and very fashionable this job is for you also have to be good at signing people up for credit so they can come back and shop with you
good,"I enjoyed working for Dillard;s. Interacting with customers and staff. Management is great and efficient, I would highly recommend Dillard;s to anyone seeking employment in a professional and fun atmosphere,"
good,I love to work there and work with my customers I met a new person and I enjoy it Just too much competition With other employeesThat didn’t like for you to do your sales but Dillard’s department store it’s a good place to work
good,"Dillards was beyond a good job, the only downside was management, they are very low staffed and have no communication with their workers. they tended to hire new people instead of letting their workers make their way up."
good,Dillard's is a family oriented company that understands that life happens. They have a firm belief in treating their employees with the up most respect.
good,"Dillards, gave me an opportunity to work there though my English at the time was not the best. Since I have been working for them my confidence in the language has grown and I feel confident in myself though I had lot of experience in the field the language barrier was a stumbling block. I will forever be grateful to them for have given me an opportunity to prove myself."
good,Overall a great place to work and with hard work and focus you can easily meet set sales goals. Dillards has allowed me to advance myself personally and professionally.
good,"Typical day would be opening the store counting registers. Acknowledge any updates and counter goals in sales. Sale fragrances, process returns, open store credit cards and provide exceptional customer service."
good,es un empleo muy bonito si en verdad disfrutas vender lo que realmente te gusta
good,"By far the best part about working for Dillard's was the people I had the oppertunity to work with. Co-workers were hard working, dedicated to clientele and overall, friendly."
good,"Stocking clothes "
good,"High energy, positive environment. Always informative of store, and individual performance, great employee sales discounts. Great health , and 401k benefits."
good,"Trabajo como sales associate en ventas y me encanta vender, y comunicarme con la gente , es una buena compañía"
good,"only left Dillards because of the fact I was having a problems with personal life at home and mother was very sick, me and my daughter lived in a rental house and it was infested with black mold due to non repairs and kept getting sick. had to leave by quitting becasue had no one to watch my daughter when we were having trouble with our home and health."
good,I love working at Dillard's in the fragrance department. Lots of energy and support among fellow employees. Holiday season is the best! Management is poor.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Dillards because I wa able to grow with the company very fast. I started as part time, went to full time in 3 months and became a sales specialist!"
good,Very competitive. if you have good people skills you will go far with the company. At the time I have hired a friend was my manager and it was a very unprofessional hire in process.
good,Leading salesperson of women's apparel in an up-scale department store.  Responsible for providing customers with detailed product information.  Cleaning out dressing rooms were the hardest because sometimes overwhelming.  Helping customers picking out clothes for special events was fun.
good,"Its a very productive job at times"
good,A typical day would be checking to make sure all the displays have their shoes in the workplace culture was on a Saturday there could be 20 people working customer service is a big part of the job greeting the customer finding what they’re looking for I think the hardest part of that job was you were running back-and-forth a lot all day long trying to find the right  shoe for the customer
good,"Great work environment, very busy at times but time flew by very fast.  Management was great, I didn't have any issues during the time frame of me working there."
good,I developed alot of relationships with customers and fellow employees during my time at Dillard's.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers and going above and beyond to meet and exceed their expectations.
good,"Had plenty of tasks, activities, and customers to keep busy. Great discounts on very good quality products. Management is usually very friendly and helpful. Great training and training continues throughout your time with them."
good,"A typical day at work involved the sale of cosmetics and fragrances.  I greeted the customers, listened to their skincare and makeup concerns and provided feedback on the right recommendations for them.  I also did makeup applications on various nationalities.  The hardest part of the job was meeting your sales quota during the slow season.  The most enjoyable part of the job was makeup application and coordinating skin care and sales events."
good,"Management was good"
good,a typical day was selling merchandise to customers and helping customers with merchandise.management was friendly workplace was awesome there was no hard part of the job for me the most enjoyable part was making sure each customer was satisfied with their purchase
good,I learned a lot when it come to sales and customer service. it was an amazing but cutthroat experience. anyone who loves competing for  higher postions then this is a job for you!
good,"I loved my time working for Dillards. It was not a typical retail job. There were real requirements from me everyday and if I did not meet them, my department would suffer."
good,Dillards offers the opportunity to be in the mall setting without actually feeling like you are in the mall.  There is a separation that allows the environment to be unique.
good,I was a cashier and I was managing my own department on juniors clothing I was like a fashionista designing the manikins and helping assist customers with their clothing
good,I worked for Dillard's many years ago and loved working with the customers. I worked in the jewelry department and enjoyed helping them find just the right accessories to compliment their dress attire.
good,As a sales associate it was a constant competition with colleagues' and became very unproductive in which everyone had problems due to the need to meet the daily sales quota. Management was inconsistent and uncooperative with their associates and never presented the type of environment in which they could have created. As a associate I learned how to provide the best customer service and how to collaborate with colleagues to achieve our goals. I also learned how to manage time and tasks due to a lack of leadership provided .
good,Very friendly environment. It's a place that you don't mind getting up and going to work there everyday. Everybody is willing to help when help is needed
good,Great place to work.  Enjoyed working in this environment.  People were friendly.  Nice place to work and build some experience. Company really takes care of there employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of job is when you accomplished things and by helping customer as a result they are happy.  Everyday was a challenge but learning how to balance customers need was an accomplishment. Management was fair and friendly.
good,"Dont post this, please. I just want to finish posting my resume...this is ridonkulous. Dillards is ok, just make sure they dont bone you. Thats about it"
good,I enjoyed my work here with this company. it made me feel like I was a part of new York every time I went to work. I would like to recommend this company to allot of people.
good,"although long hours over all it was good, missed the co workers. not the having to make quota on credit cards, but also missed regular customers. and most of the management."
good,fun and great working environment building good communication with customers multitasking everyday managing sales in stores making sure customer service was excellent
good,A typical day at work would be a day of learning. Everyday the individual will encounter different and challenging experiences in customer service while they improve their expertise in sales. Management in Dillards is a great supportive system that helps you in anyway they can. The workplace culture in Dillards is well divided with an American culture and Hispanic culture. I would say the hardest part of the job is to get to meet every employee in the store since there are 200 plus employees. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the fact that you get to interact with many different customers as well as employees.
good,dillards was a great and fun place to work. part time.. enjoyed the people and the customers you get to interact with. the managers are great but the store manager not so helpful
good,As long as you follow the guidelines it is an amazing business to work for. I gave it my all in pleasing my cusomers therefore it made my job fun and easy
good,Very good company to work for and great and safe environment. The co-workers are very nice and are always ready to help. If we don't have a shoe sizes in the back that a customer needs they are more than honored to order it for that customer.
good,"a regular day at work is typically slow if it is not holiday season, you'll see about 20 customers every 30 minutes, which isn't a lot of a 2 level department store. Hardest part about the job is being on your feet all day long."
good,Enjoyed being the Bridal Consultant for Dillards. My first job out of college. Learned much about the retail world and grew in management knowledge.
good,Helped find what custom wanted customer satisfaction is very very important decorating with employees was good good work environment  dillards is really good to their employees understanding
good,"A very demanding job because some customers don't agree with my taste and very fussy. But, it happens and I learned how to cope. Management was very supportive and caring. That makes a job so much more pleasant."
good,"I relocated from Connecticut to Arizona for this position due to their commitment and loyalty to their staff. Each day was diverse in some way and I enjoyed working with the public, staff and managers.My honesty, integrity and trustworthiness were valued highly and this was often communicated to me. Management also ensured that the work environment was enjoyable despite difficult situations such as loss prevention interventions with customers. Upon nationally eliminating my position from their stores, I returned to Connecticut to be closer to family."
good,"great discount, the managers were hard to take serious but they were nice. I loved the competitive nature of this job. very easy to get a raise. great"
good,This was a positive experience overall. It helped to build my leadership skills and maintain strong interpersonal relationships. People and customers.
good,Retail is always very busy especially during the holidays. Dillard's is a very great company to work for. They are very flexible with your work schedule and you get amazing benefits from being with the company.
good,Over the years you see the same people and grow to know them. You have your regulars that only like dealing with you. Good benefits. Did show employees gratitude.
good,"It was a different place to work. It was really competitive and they often pitted employees against each other. The quota was hard to reach for many of the departments. They could be unfair and the store manager was quite rude at times. I did though, like being a makeup representative and had fun fulfilling this job. We were offered a chance to go to a class in St. Louis but were denied by the department manager. She did not want to assign someone else to work the counter. It was a unfair situation, everyone else in our division was there."
good,This job is fun and also a great way to meet new people. Easy to learn but dealing with the public is not always an easy task.
good,The management is under qualified and chosen poorly. This store is the land of the gossip. Looks are everything to management in this store.
good,"Great work environment I love my job, great opportunities for advancement, great team and management. Free stuff if you work in cosmetics, lots of gratis, huge employee discount when you combine it with permanently reduced merchandise sales."
good,"Dillard's is one of the best companies to work at, detailed training is offered for the new hires and duties are presented in an easy manner."
good,"There are many great and hard working people within this company. whether markdowns or new merchandise, we all work together to get the job done."
good,"fun place to work with something always needing to do, management was always working with employees with schedules and family concerns, one negative was the max out pay for this position no matter of time in position"
good,"I love working at Dillard's. We have a great group of people who love what they do. Management cares about how well we're doing each day and are always there tell us what we can improve on. We have group meetings pretty often in which are NEVER separated between floors, we always come together as a team. I've learned a lot of strategies in order to sell Dillard's credit cards to customers, which I feel could definitely be useful in any job when trying to promote an item."
good,"- a typical day at work is interacting with customers all day and make sure you meet your quota for that day."
good,Staff was very knowledgeable and competitive in a sales goal based raise environment. The store was beautiful and I enjoyed my time there very much. Management was wonderful.
good,"All of the workers alongside myself acted like a big family, which made going to work so enjoyable. Working in sales support was a rewarding feeling because after each task I could see the relief in the customer I was assisting or completing and processing an online order really made it feel like I was a part of the system. The only downside from my experience would have to be when I was working behind the customer service counter by myself and needed to use the restroom and would have to wait until a manager was free. Some days were definitely a lot less productive than others, but Dillard's is a large department store with regular sales widely advertised, so those days were always very exciting."
good,"Plenty opportunity for advancement in the company, Nice work environment. Management needs attitude adjustments Store Manager to be particular."
good,"I only worked for Dillard's for almost a year and I really enjoyed my time there. My manager was the best, the hours were very flexible and she worked with me on my school schedule. The customers were good and the pay was actually good for retail. The only downside is in this particular department you had to make commission to keep your job, and on slow days or clearance season its a hard thing to accomplish. Overall the company is a great place to work."
good,"Great company, average salary.  Very little room for advancement.  Benefits were not good.  I was lucky and had all great store managers.  I enjoyed hiring and training new hires.  I did all the new hire training in the store as well as all admin. work."
good,Dillards was a great job. it paid decent and the team was encouraging. if you didn't meet your sales goals they would fire you. but in some departments making sales was easy. shoes was the only department that made commission.
good,I manage twenty associates in a high volume department store. I have learned how to work fast and efficient while still guiding my team through everyday situations.
good,I worked for Dillard's three times over an eight year period.(the only person in the stores history) I retained a customer base of repeat customers. Fun place to work!
good,I love this company. I love to shop there and I loved working there the people were so nice and I learned a lot in the workplace when working there.
good,Dillard's is a great work environment with exceptional benefits and a hard-working management team. Discounts available to employees are helpful and the location provides for a safe work place.
good,"sold shoes and shoe accessories"
good,I really enjoyed my workplace @ Dillard's because it was an  ongoing pace that made myself become manager! I hope that it will be another great opportunity for myself because of the pay and effort being made for the customers needs being met as well as help with their own shopping. To me everyone was involved with that every single day. We did not give up neither did we give in! I learn that at an early age people that want to pay their bills must have your undivided attention! Nevertheless My job was to be kind and very courteous to those people of all kind in spite of my favorite part of this job! To be accurate with the time became somewhat bothersome but at least I had a job well done! Thanks!
good,"Remerchandise Merchandise, making it appealing to the costumer to offer a better shopping experience."
good,"I enjoyed working here and it paid more than minimum wage, but once the busy season was over, with Aiken Mall being a small mall anyway, the business slowed down, and more senior employees got the customers and the sales quotas before new ones like me could."
good,"good place to work, very competitive, you have to be ready to make sales and be cheerful, face to face interactions. good supervisors, clean place to work, and gratis"
good,"warehouse work looking up and putting together order for on-line shoppers.scaning and loading  trucks,keeping area clean."

Organize and prep all collateral and signage. Start to open our CAD (clientele at Dillards) to make thank you calls and to recommend new products and/or tell them about upcoming events. lots of pre-sales for GWP (gifts with purchase) in our more prominent lines (Lancome, Estee Lauder and Clinique). When there is down time we read up on new products and learn how to use/ apply them. Meanwhile we have to reach a sales goal the entire time, mine is 80$ an hour to support my pay. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to always learn and have a hands on experience with my products and customers."
good,Very good job to have. I got excellent experience in sales and customer service.
good,assisting customers with purchases. Answering questions about products.

good,"Come in early to make sure that all merchadise is in it's right place. The merchandise priced correctly and the store is clean and straight.  I learned how to run cash register's, gift wrapping, making price signs off of the conmputer.  My co-workers were the nicest people you could work with. Helpful, friendly, hard workers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when I got promoted to back-up auditor in eight months because I was very good at my job."
good,"consistently made my sales quota, Long hours but very rewarding."

I was new to all things when I started this job, although I felt as though I had no problem in with applying customer service skills, I feel like that is applied to life everytime you encounter another person. I learned how to up-sell items to customers, working in clothing you learn to upsell when a customer is purchasing a shirt, show them what else will look great with it, and knowing the product and quality of the item makes it easier. working in the home dept listening to the customer was a #1, let the customer tell you what they vision in their home, and then show them what you would suggest according to the information given, this is also applied in any company, I enjoyed seeing my customers walk out of the store happy about the purchase they have made and will be more than happy to come back and give the company more business."

good,"        The managers at Dillards run a smooth operation.  It was such a pleasure to work for a company that had a system that was tried and true.  I could'nt have asked for a more compassionate manager.  Go Dillards! I wish we had one in Bakersfield, CA."

I learned about the various foot types, how to distinguish sizing according to shape and angle of each individual's foot, and also how to stretch a shoe manually. Management was great. I enjoyed all my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and getting to know the regulars. The hardest part of the job was learning shoe sizing.

We worked through construction in the store, the economic recovery, and spent countless hours donating time and resources to various fundraisers and organizations over my years as manager."
good,"Typically whenever I come in for my shift the first thing I do is check to see who I’m working with and what tasks have been started. I check my dashboard to see where my numbers are for the day, and I check to see if I have any messages or appts. I will conduct bra fittings periodically through the day and try to do my best to meet customer needs."
good,I enjoy working here. I have worked in 2 locations and the transfer process was easy. Each store is a little different based on the leadership in that store.
good,on a typical day you would go in and have a meeting about what you did the day before and what you needed to do that day. the worst thing was when you got so busy to keep checking on dressing room then you go in there and clothes are piled thats the awful part about it all. everything else at dillards went smooth
good,Great company to work for.  Family oriented great discounts!!  Able to move around when positions open up.  Company is flexible to work with other work schedules or classes.
good,"If you use to working in a slow paced environment then Dillard's is not the place for you! If you put in the effort and can adapt well to last minute changes then you'll be fine."
good,"Passion for fashion! The pay is real nice and worth the job. If you enjoy putting together outfits, you’ll most definitely enjoy this job. I loved the feeling of fulfilling someone’s fashion needs."
good,"Dillard's is great pay, you have to go in there and really do your job to get any of the extra benefits. The managers are young so sometimes the can be unruly."
good,"Store management, esp the store manager, supports and goes above and beyond to help me build the bridal business"
good,Dillard's set sales goals which were difficult to meet.  You had to make sales where there was none to be made.  I found it very difficult and frustrating.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed helping the customers find exactly what they were looking for. And especially liked when I could help them find something they loved but had never thought of or even considered before.
good,"Room for improvement..training"
good,"I was good at my job i had alot of fun and met great people there was drama sometimes but i always ignored it ,the job paid well and you learn alot . The only issue i had was i was late since i dont have a car and as a coporation they could only excuse so  much so they let me go"
good,"Dillard's was a very competitive workplace. However, the pay was well worth it. The employees were great to work with. However, management could definetly be improved."
good,This was fun and challenging I enjoyed being on the phone with clients and staying busy at collecting bonuses on the funds I collected.  Management challenged each person and stayed involved in all parts of this.  Moved from the area for personal needs is the only reason for my departure.
good,"Very easy paced, can be busy on good dales or holidays. Pay is fair, not too many hours, the store is a clearance center. The managers are great and coworkers are nice."
good,This jib has a lot of benefits however it has high expectations of there employees. You are to meet sale goals and sell credit cards. You interact with a lot of customers as well as different departments.
good,I have had a fairly good time here. Management is very unorganized right now and so is the schedule. The most enjoyable part or work is coming to work and talking to customers/clients.
good,I sold ladies shoes and it was a great experience.  They worked around your life and was very understanding about college classes.  My job at Walmart made me appreciate this job culture.  Walmart will tear anyone down and human resource is a joke
good,"Would /love to be back with this company. Great hours, Great associates, just a very stable environment. Plus great opportunities to grow and succeed ......................................................."
good,"For the three months that I have been working at Dillard's I have enjoyed my time. I work in the accessories department and the environment is very relaxed. The co workers are very helpful when training new employees, but the management needs some work. making schedules is difficult because it almost never correlates with the availability. This is an easy fix though, if you bring this up to your manager it is fixed almost immediately. the hardest part of the job is finding somewhere to put all the stock and the easiest part of the job is the actual job of sales associate itself. Most of this job is self explanatory and extremely easy to get used to within a week of working there. overall, it has been a great work experience thus far."
good,"great place to work, good work life balance, enjoyed the mix of the customers. slow in being able to advance in the company"
good,"I enjoy the varies of task and job and customer I work with on daily basic. The management was OK, they would cut hours after I ask and increases. Employee were OK, had some good and some bad. I truly enjoy the customers."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company.  Being able to get off in enough time to enjoy time with my family was awesome.  The management was okay, I never really had an problems with them.  My co-workers and I got along well because we were a team and didn't mind helping each other with duties.  The hardest part of the job would have to been unloading large trucks."
good,"Personally, I learned a lot about myself and others in the work environment. My co-workers were sweet and helped me learn more about everything.The hardest part of my job was the obvious favoritism but the most enjoyable was the pay!"
good,"I was pregnant at the time but my experience her was amazing I worked with wonderful workers, they didn't treat me unfairly, I worked just as hard as everyone else, I stocked shoes, cleaned the tables, gave great customer service. the hardest part of the day may have been walking up and down the stairs in the back to get shoes but only cause i was fully pregnant, that is also why I left the store. but would love to go back."
good,"Greet and assist clients upon arrival to department. Assist with clothing/item needs, promote new merchandise arrivals, promotional events. Assist with final purchases at register. Maintain department cleanliness, and arrangement of merchandise. Assist with merchandising of new item arrivals. Build, promote, and maintain customer clientele for invitations for future merchandise needs. I acquired skill in foundation garment fittings, product knowledge of  "
good,My father was an excellent salesman and was highly motivated to teach others his sales techniques. I enjoyed working with him and at the same time he was much more demanding of me than the other agents he had working for him. After he was diagnosed with a terminal illness the agency was sold to afford his medical care.
good,"Was a good place t work."
good,"It was fun working with Dillard's. I enjoyed meeting and talking to different people. I also like the manager, the assistant manager and most of my co-workers on the floor. But the most enjoyable part of the job is the sales discounts when merchandise is on clearance. Not only that, I also got a lot of free stuffs whenever I open a store card account for the customers. The only hardest or the most challenging part of the job is to reach and maintain a sales quota which has a significant impact on earnings."
good,I work for a company where Sales is the number one priority. I sale children shoes. I have a quota that I need to meet each day in order to keep my job. 
good,I was a sales clerk which was exciting for me for one of my first jobs as a adult. It gave me a chance to use my imagination and put the merchandise on the shelves and help customers. Management was very respectful and always used their time to train and talk to you. The hardest part of this job was it was time consuming putting merchandise on the counters and constantly having to rotate merchandise while trying to be the best assistance as possible to the customer. This job was the start of my retail career and allowed me to see all aspects of the retail job.
good,"Showing customers our product, and explaining to them the benifits"
good,They work well with a school schedule! The pay is better than most places around. It’s a fast paced job especially around the months leading to Christmas.
good,"Customer care, stocking, set sale prices, commission, fix up jewelry cases, straighten floor, handled money, made calls to repeated customers on sales"
good,Store manager is biased and doesn't listen to everyone. He wanted people to kiss up to him so they can keep their Job. Too many managers trying to act like the boss
good,"I worked in receiving,it was fun,the staff  would receive the daily inventory,then take the clothes to the various departments.I also had to vacumn the whole Women's department."
good,Honestly if pay was there I would still work there. The environment was great.  Family company which was a plus for me. Dillards wants every associate
good,I learned a lot. It have me the experience to got to work for what you love doing and be happy to get up and go every day. It also teaches good responsibility skills.
good,its a competitive job in order to get a raise every year you have to make sure you are making your quota when they do your annual review so if your looking to make friends this is not the place cause people will get jealous of but other than that its a wonderful place to work at
good,"Competing for sales is tough, definitely no job security, no room for advancement.  Vacation time is limited, they change schedules without notification."
good,Most days at Dillards were pretty routine.You open your register and confirm your total cash in the register.You greet the customers and help them with items requested. It was very important to maintain a organized and clean environment. It was very important to put your customer first by engaging with them and making sure their needs were met. The hardest part of the job was meeting your daily goals when business was slow. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing the people you met left satisfied with their purchase.
good,Liked the environment and diversity of the store. Specialized in high end merchandise. Loved the discount and location. I did not like the way the store had all the sales personnel pitted against one another fighting for sales. Was crazy and cut throat.
good,"A good place to work if you want to work and make good money. Pay is based on hourly plus production in the distribution centers. Lots of walking, bending, stooping, and occasional lifting of cartons (depending on the area you work in)."
good,"Dillard's as a whole is a great company to work, and they take care of their employees. As far as the management in my store they lacked leadership. my over experience with Dillard's has been a great one, for the most part."
good,Learned how to work efficiently and quickly in a fast work paced environment. I enjoyed reaping the benefits of making production. Company shows appreciation towards hard workers.
good,Loved working here. Loved the lunch time.  They changed managers for my department and that helped alot of problems. I left because I moved if I didn't move i would have loved to stayed.
good,it was ok i liked my job and the people i worked with. Everybody was  nice and very helpful. Somewhat flexible but sometimes you have to go through a lot
good,"It was my duty to open, clean, and close the store each day. I managed about 15 people and had to fix all the things from escalators or point of sale machines.  I did an exceptional job and was very efficient."
good,"Doing Sales at Dillard's is very chill and a great environment. I love to talk to people about men's clothing , which helped me with sales. I was great with helping customer ."
good,"Great place to work, had fun, easy job, great way to communicate with many different people. Did get stressful when it came to quotas. The managers are understanding, but do expect, expectations to be done."
good,would return any time. I love to assist clients whith there skin care needs and overall concerns about skin care or makeup and anti ageing benefits that can be achieved with proper skin care
good,"Working at Dillard's gives you a great opportunity to learn many different aspects of working in retail. As a Dillard's sales associate I was polished with communication fashion and persuasive skills. I experienced collaborative team-work, merchandising, up-selling, and representing the company's fashion standards. Learning strong customer service focus with strengths in product familiarity, cash register operation and ability to form long-standing relationships with guest. "
good,nice workplace and co-workers. it feels great to help costumer everyday and have a positive feedback at the end of the day
good,Dillard's is a great store to with beautiful merchandise that sells itself. It was a joy to assist customers when making their purchases. A day at Dillard's began with morning motivational meetings. The management team and fellow employees were like family. The hardest part of the job was making the weekly sales quota. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiling faces of satisfied customers.
good,I enjoy working off duty here. The Golden Triangle Mall has a great atmosphere and everybody always works with a positive attitude.I learned a lot with working with the public and always doing community policing.
good,Fast-paced environment.  Sales is very competitive.  Management was fine.  There were a lot of good people.  There was not a hard part.  Got to help a lot of customers with their selections.
good,"Dillards is a good place to work part time.  I enjoyed introducing patrons to various fragrances and helping them decide what they wanted.  I learned to listen to their desires and wants.  "
good,"My review regarding Dillards is a hard one. I specifically enjoyed most employees And upper Management. Any time I had a question or concern regarding my goals and acheivements they always had time. I noticed each associate had a very high SPH and if SPH was met, their hourly pay would drop as high as $2.00 hr. I felt if pay was lowered by 25 cents on each associate, all SPH goals would be met. I noticed associates being fired or laid off as they got close to retirement. I understand ""reason"" although it happened to frequently, as other associates noticed fraring their own job security. I worked for Dillards to spent more time with my teen daughter, whom curtently attends KU. Lowering my financial income was a choice I made as a single mom. I did not have the stress worring about my daughter,as I was home at a decent hour. I learned allot about myself working ar Dillards. I have a unique skill ""customer service"" developing relations with all returning customer. Building new relations and i was always numer 1 of the 5 top sellers. I am good, NO, I am Excellent at sales and marketing including Customer Relations."
good,Working for Dillard's had many benefits. The people that work there tend to like the store and many wind up staying for years.
good,Great management and co workers. Worked well with my scheduled to work part time.
good,"A constant moving high energy job. Customer satisfaction, phone calls, shipping, and of course vault and responsible for all money flow/tracking."
good,"it was great "
good,"Achieved all sales goals, helped and greeted all customers. Educated well over products daily. Gave skin care consultations, and makeovers to guest. Exceeded all gift with purchases goals. Made clients look and feel their best. "
good,Being able to help customers find what would make them feel good. Working with  nice people
good,"Love working for Lancome at Dillard's. It's a sales job.The downfall to the job was that I was constantly harassing customers by calling them for every GWP and event that Dillard's had. There is NO work/life balance. You're schedule is given to you for an entire month. Often you have to work 6 or 7 days in a row before you get a day off and your days off are usually spaced apart; rarely having any consecutive days off. But the beauty about the job, you get free makeup and it's a fun place to work if you like people."
good,"Day consists of assisting customers, assisting other associates, and responsibilities of the department that you are working. Management and co-workers all seemed to get a long great!"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed being able share my talent as a makeup artist as well as an educator with the everday consumer.
good,I learned about my products I was selling. Got to go to meetings about company changes and got free makeup every year.
good,"Help customers if needed, use cash register, stock racks and label sale items, design displays."
good,Helped custermers with cosmetic purchases. Trained new employees. Booked phone orders and mini events.
good,"One thing that I could change about my job would be the hours. If you have a family, it's hard the balance work and life. I love my job other than that. Dillard's recognizes your hard work and efforts. I love that about them."
good,"Love working around clothes, they have the best shopping experience I always shopped here even when I didn't work here, helping customers with choosing different fragrances and smelling new perfumes that came in was awesome"
good,Had problem with an employee of foreign decent and took it to supv but it was not addressed. And when I told mgmt that I was phobic in garage parking it was dismissed totally.
good,def a good work place. it felt like a high school enviroment just bc every one gossips there. the competitiveness depended on which department you worked in but for the most part only the older people were worried about sales. they do hire younger people who arent in college so they can get sucked up into the world of Dillards.
good,A day at Dillard was very productive. After unloading trucks we have to make sure the merchandise gets out to the floor properly. we had a team goal but also worked individually.
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed all of the people that I got to meet and work with and the pay was decent. Management was fine also. I did have a sales quota that I had to meet and that would probably be the most difficult part of working there.
good,Love it ...had to move home...for family ...very good job...I would have never left this job...I love people and this job made me be my more then I was I grow
good,Each day you are given a sales goal and expected to reach this goal everyday. If you do not meet your goal the remaining number will carry over into the next working day and you are required to add that to your new daily goal and each day you work this will happen. you are required to keep a client book and make phone calls to these clients and let them know about any promotions or sale or new product that has came in.
good,"A typical day for me at Dillard's started with reviewing yesterday. The sales result,addressing emails and customer issues. The addressing any time clock punch issues. Then walking the floor and making a daily assignment sheet of details. After opening the store,the rest of the day involved answering emails and dealing with issues that came during regular operations.I also would be involved in writing various reports for store safety depending on the time of the month. I was also the lead at unloading trucks."
good,Most days were long out of season. You have to stay motivated in your daily sales goals and it's also a great company if going to school at night. Management will more than likely work with you.
good,"I worked in the corporate/buying office and it was really great to see how things work behind the scenes in the retail business. I had a great manager and really learned a lot,"
good,"Meeting new people daily is nice, trying to find space to put new merchandise sometimes is hard being a small department. Management provides training on new products so we are aware of the technology of new arrivals and there functions."
good,it was fun in at start but catching people made is stressful especialy if they did a hit and run on us they would ask us what happen I'm only one person overall it was good but too many people to steal.
good,"what your weekly pay would be liked working at the company,had a good working environment pay was based on commission sales,which made it very difficult"
good,Working at Dillard's was fun made a lot of nice people customers were nice and came back and ask for you. But some of the workers tried to say they were helping a customer when they weren't a lit cut throat...
good,"Dillard's is a company that breeds competition with its sales goals that each team member is required to achieve to maintain employment. If you aren't a go getter or someone who is competitive and willing to go about and beyond, this is not the place for you."
good,So many women are uncomfortable in their bras. Dillard's certified me to help change all of that.  It's nice to help them fix the problems. Who knew that wearing a great bra can change your life.
good,"unload the truck with my co workers or process clothes so that we can bring them to the floor .so that they can be purchased,the hardest part of the job was trying to make every one happy ,the best part of the job was the work environment i was surrounded by"
good,"Having a quota, sales were very important which made this job very competitive with your coworkers. Pay was good but you always had to be on top of making your numbers day in and day out."
good,"I loved doing what I was doing there, but you had to meet a sales quota, and with the store going under, it was hard to meet a daily sales quota. If that wasn't the deal, it would be worth it."
good,I love my job especially interacting with customers.  It is the constant standing that has me thinking about changing jobs.  In August last year I had surgery on both of my feet and I believe the standing is the reason for that.
good,We had given sales quotas which we have to meet with in a certain time limit. We all have have assigned duties inside the stick room which we have fulfill on weekly basis.
good,A typical day at work involves assisting customers.  I've learned to be attentive to assist with anticipating the need of others at all time. Management is very good.  Workplace culture is satisfying. The hardest part of the job is to assess continual needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting others.
good,Loved working here. I met so many different people and got to help them shop! it keeps you on your toes and you will never be bored. I love greeting and getting to know customers and lots of them even became friends!
good,"I enjoy making women smile, making them feel beautiful and important. I love talking and getting to know new people. Introducing new products and doing makeovers were very fun."
good,"I enjoyed this job.  You worked your own little area usually by yourself.  We were on sales quota but it was an average.  I was able to maintain the average.   If you fell below you were let go.  The hardest  part of the job was putting an outfit together, because if you roamed other departments it was frowned on.  That isn't fair to the customer.   We needed freedom to roam around and help them.  It also helped our total sales amount.  I do not think sales quota's are good for that reason.  Most enjoyable was the customers and helping them.   Management was helpful in the learning process.  We had on the job training for the register."
good,"When they say you work hard for your money, that is so true. This job paid great money and had great benefits , was a great place of employment if you tend to your own business. But I decided that I need something better for myself. So as of now, I am continuing my education."

good,Opening cash registers and straightening department through out the day greeting every customer and giving personal service to each and every customer suggesting and putting outfits together.  I have learned that every customer is different and adjusting to their needs is very important. Management can change work rules at any time to suit their needs. I am able to adjust myself with co-workers. The hardest part of my job was to keep an eye out for thieves who frequent the store to steal. Most enjoyable part was that I was around  customers and got a lot of satisfaction when customers left happy with what the bought.
good,The hours were fantastic early starts to the day and getting out mid afternoon allowed for having a life outside of work. The job was challenging and you were rewarded for your efforts.

good,"It was a nice place to work, it is easy to get a job they give everybody an opportunity to interview with them and work there. If you get a job there just be on time and don't make any excuses you will last long."

good,"manages and co workers were cool, understanding, and laid back. work wasn't as bad as I thought I'd be. would not mind going back to work there again if I had to."
good,"Dillards was a great job where i supervised 11-13 sales associates to ensure the merchandise modeled the company floor plans according to heel height,shoe type and color.I checked schedules for my staff to assign stock based on daily shipments. I ensured sales associates performed daily audits,to guarantee merchandise was priced correctly.I created a systematic way to organize daily shipments and stock room to make sure the most merchandise is available and correctly priced for customers."
good,"The Dillard's internship was disappointing, I thought I was going to learn a lot about management. They did not care about their interns and made them do sale associate work. I felt like they did not know what to do with their interns when all we wanted to know is learn more about our major and gain experience."
good,"Very fast pace work environment which I enjoyed because it made the day go by fast."

good,"I actually really enjoy working for this company and the job itself. The people are really nice and the management treats you like human beings. Orders are asked of rather then barked at. I get to dress nicely and professionally which I like.  The down sides to the job are the fact that you are on a sales per hour which makes things difficult during slow times and sometimes you have to be really competitive with your fellow employees over sales whether intentional or not.  That also depends on who you work with though also. Some of my employees are good about making sure everyone gets sales others will step on your help of others. It's good to work with those that work as a team. Then other times Im doing better and Im getting more sales and am asked to share. Really just depends on the day. I call making your sph a hit or miss. Some days Im well over other days Im lucky to make even half of the intended sales goal which actually is more then your sph compared to hours, but if thats the goal set that's what I try to meet. I feel like havinig to meet a sales per hour and not knowing if you can really count on that makes me feel like my job is not a stable position.  Other then that this is the best job I've had. I had experience already with markdowns, ticketing, cashiering, stocking, things of that sort already I had to get used to the actual initiating of the sales and helping the customers at first. Turns out I think Im better at that then the rest of my job.  I would definetly recommend Dillards as a great place to work.  Everyone is very nice and pretty laid back you are"
good,"Dillard's is a awesome place to work if your into name brand clothing, shoes, accessories, perfume and cologne. it is a very peaceful place to work but it can be sometimes quick."
good,"I had the opportunity to do a fun job, doing what I always like to do, advise people how to improve their looks and at the same time be able to produce."
good,"Great distribution family! Most, most managers were down to earth and realistic Getting time off was easy, they understood that the employees have a personal life that could sometimes need a little more attention than normal."
good,"People is being challenge to fulfill goals of sales to have motivated pays increases every 6 months, managers treat employees with dignity and respect. Strong customer service culture. only problem is not many sales posted make place to don't have a lot of customers as other nearest competitors."
good,"hardest part of the job is the sale per hour rates and if you work in petites not many sales. "
good,"I've worked in several establishments in retail.  This company was my first experience as working independently to obtain sales goals it was a new experience for me.  Even though working in this type of unfamiliar setting I am able to meet my daily SPH obligations along with maintain rank in the top 10 percentage in the store sales daily and ranking in the top 50th position in our district"
good,"Shoes sales and handling stock was a typical day,"

good,"Wait on customers and open and close the store."
good,"I enjoyed the responsibilities place upon me at Dillards. If registers did not balance I researched transactions to resolve issues and trained associates on how to properly process sales with- in the network. My support from management was phenomenal. Dillards has managers that have been with the company for years, so if I ever had any questions or concerns it was nice to have people around who knew all the ends and outs. Working in a large store is a great feeling, because there are such a variety of people with different backgrounds which allows us all to bring something different to the table."

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"I worked with off-duty police officers. "
good,There was a lot to learn as it had been many years since I had worked in retail.  The management team was very helpful in training and supportive.  Meeting the customers was a great benefit of the position.  The hardest part of the job was working with co-workers that would undermine your sales.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening your register, cleaning your department while making room for your new shipment. Providing excellent customer service is essential, helping customers find the right sizes and helping them dress is often done."
good,"customer service, daily cash auditing, stocked, displayed items"

good,"Worked in children's department, enjoyed interacting with them but also able to understand and full fill the wants of the parents."
good,Management at Dillard's was great. They were always there to assist you with any help you needed. There were always 2-3 co-workers working together in the same department. The hardest part of the job was moving merchandise everyday.
good,I really liked working here with all the ladies. Gaining knowledge about a vast array of clothing lines. I loved everything about working there making a person feeling great both inside and out. I didn't like how they did somethings but that comes with they territory of working.
good,"A typical work day was very long, always greeting customers, meeting sales goals, always dressed professional. Because it was mostly customer service it was great."
good,"I love this work. It is a good mixture of physical, organizational and people interaction. Not everybody seemed too thrilled to work here which can definitely affect one's attitude on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed learning the basics of sizing and selections working in Dillards Lingerie department. I took pride in top sells and monthly honors.

good,Every nice work environment to work in .They care about there coworkers .Both of my store Manager was wonderful and very understanding  also when it came in to family matters
good,"fun and sophisticated place with very energizing people to help and educate customers on cosmetics,latest fashion and styles. there is a morning meeting everyday so that we all know about sales and to learn about the increase and decrease of each department and as a whole store on slow days it can be a challenge to make your daily goals so a lot of being creative and figure out  ways to get your sales in to make plan."
good,I was able to move around and the place sometime when your area ran out of work to learn how to different thing but to me wasn't hard because I am a hard worker but sometime challenge because things change to where it didn't work with my kids schedules but I learn alot and came a better person got to know people
good,Enjoy working at Dillards and meeting different people everyday and being able to make a great sale.Wish I could go back and work for Dillard’s again.
good,During the holidays it’s hectic but you can move up quickly some of the employees are great to work with  and some are not but focus on your self and you will be fine
good,Easy money and good management. The problem is the crazy hours. No set schedules. Employees do get commission which makes everyone very competitive...
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillards twice at two of their locations the Marion IL location and the Fairview Heights IL location and liked working at both stores! Had great coworkers and bosses, fun and productive environment and high quality products! I only left because I took a much higher paying job with the government. The only thing I did not like was having to do all of the signage in the cosmetic and fragrance area in Marion IL store, signs very heavy and cumbersome to carry across the store and lift on top of bays for females and dangerous to do. I would not work at this store again for that reason only. We did not have to do this at the Fairview Heights store."
good,I naturally relate to the public well so interacting and helping clients was easy for me. Creating and building displays was something I thoroughly enjoyed. Very busy days whether there are a lot of customers or new merchandise to put up or a reset to do or all the above. Can be challenging but also rewarding. We had goal incentives periodically that I won 4 times resulting in a bonus and merchandise worth $300+. I found the employees to be extremely nice and very helpful to work with.

good,"I have experience with closing and opening procedures, doing markdowns, assisting customers find merchandise, processing payments and keeping the store neat all of which I believe is relevant to being a good sales associate. Everyday is a learning curve as I get to meet different people from different backgrounds with different needs but I strive to deliver good customer service to the customers."
good,Job had good pay. No benefits for part time. Not enough hours. Weekly pay. Bad management. Management chose sides. Bad sales. Had to reach a goal a day.
good,"Product displays, inventory, customer service and atmosphere production plays a major part in getting a person to spend money. but most important is the sales associate."
good,"I loved the employees at Dillard’s, they made working there fun and a great environment. Managers always care about there floor and really easy to talk to."
good,was very happy working at Dillard's..loved all my customers and had many repeated customers I loved seeing them on their return..the best part of the position was when each person was hired I trained them on the register so I was able to get to know them personally ..it was a very positive moment for me to meet each and every one of them as they entered their working journey with Dillard's. my association with Dillard's was a positive one..I had great Managers for the fifteen years I worked for them.I was treated with great respect all the years I worked there..I knew just about everyone in the store and that store had three floors..I felt so loved by all the associates and customers.I loved going to work each day and it doesn't get any better than that. A typical day at work was dusting putting away merchandise setting up tables for displays waiting on customers and what ever else was needed to do that day
good,Working at Dillard's was very rewarding. I was able to meet a lot of new and interesting people. I bonded with most of my employees. The break room wasn't very good. I loved working at dillard's.
good,"Selling for me is hard because I don't like to be annoying when pushing sales but other than that, I loved working there. Management is great. Associates are great."

good,"Sales and quotas, talking and selling. Fun interacting with people and knowledgeable of constant incoming merchandise. Using your creative ability to display new merchandise. Delivering quality customer service."
good,"Meeting quotas is a constant challenge as a sales associate. Depending on management and coworkers, the environment can be helpful or harmful to workers’ mental health and job satisfaction. I would recommend Dillard’s as a company to work for, but be sure you will be dedicated to your job."
good,A great place to work co workers are friendly managers were good no complaints the work was easy and fun customers were satisfied I've enjoyed helping others
good,The management was top tier in service to both workers and customers. The atmosphere is relaxed and the work isn't anything difficult. The training encompasses everything you'll need to know about the job.
good,"Although it was the first time I’ve ever had  competition when it came to making sales, after a while of working hard into trying to please the customers you get accustomed to it. Try your hardest and never let other people try to bring you down."

good,There are awesome opportunities to create life-long friendships and connections in the retail world. The managers were compassionate about their employees.
good,The job is pretty fast paced but overall a good learning environment. You learn new methods to do your job as well as different ways to help satisfy the clients
good,Dillards is a higher up kind of retail store. They dont have floor teams to set displays or mark down merchandise and thats why dillards employees get paid more.
good,"It wasn't hard work, just competitive work and we were paid fairly good for what we did. The hardest part was meeting a  quota with too many sales associates working in each area."
good,I really enjoyed working here I just couldn't do the hours any longer with finishing up with school it got to be difficult. But now Im getting ready to graduate.
good,weekends were always busy especially the parking spaces. fun work place loved working the jewelry sometimes I would have to help other departments clean up before leaving

good,Arriving at work I would open my department. Check reports and goals of the day. Management were approachable and the hardest part would be when I would have to leave each day
good,Great people at a great place. We are all a family there. You have to learn how to stock and set the shelves and be good on your feet. They also give you a discount for working there.
good,"You will find so many friends at Dillards. It never once felt like a competition with them, however because everything was based on quotas, there wasn't much we could do for the flow of customers. The store has lovely and very nice quality clothes and you can always get a good deal as an employee. However being part time meant that your schedule was usually very crazy, with one day working 3 hours and the next working 8 or even 9. there were paid breaks and even nice discounts from the other food places."
good,"They offered the employee discounts on their purchases. The health"
good,Had great experience with manager.  Main problem is their policy on raises   Have sales per day you must  accomplish or at reviews  your pay is decreased.  Think they should have reevaluated this policy.
good,"A typical day at Dillard's is greeting every customer and making sure they need help. When a customer needs help, you have to help them every step to help ensure them that that is the product that they want."

good,"Great work environment. Pleasant employees. Must meet sales quota, but not too hard to meet. Overall good place to work with decent pay for a tourist area."
good,"Retail is difficult but enjoyable work if you like working with people and enjoy customer service, which I do.  Job involved a lot of lifting which I can no longer do."

There was never anything hard about the job, but I did not like when we have too much down time because we had done everything on our task sheet for the day."
good,"Its a great place to work at, but you pretty much live there if you're full time. During holidays, you hardly get any time with your loved ones. However, management treats you with respect."

I worked well with my co-workers, even though we worked on commission. Had to over come objectives. I enjoyed sitting the rooms up,decorating them with beautiful furniture and accessories. Then selling to the customers."

The most enjoyable part is that I get to meet people from all over the United States. Communication and customer services is the key to a successful business.
good,"A very great place to work. Really loved my co-workers because we assisted each other when we could and it was very little bickering. Being in management was very challenging sometimes because of the long hours and the amount of time given to you to complete your task. The hardest part about the job was just the amount of time I spent at work and away from family and friends. My upper bosses were great, really easy to talk to people who listened to you when you had problems."
good,"a typical day would be,watching shoppers for theft also all employees to make sure there in compliance with store policy, the hardest part of my job is to be able too watch shoplifters and ,at the same time notifying management of theft,while talking over the radio with security and making sure the shoplifter does not dump the items on the way out ,so we don't have lawsuits for a bad stop on a customer"
good,"Really good company to work for with great associates to work with. Has opportunity to grow if your seeking a career in retail."

good,"good pay, easy and comfortable place to work, u have a place for developing your career"
good,"A typical day during the week at Dillard's is very slow but yet we still we have a lot of duties that need to be done.  The job motivates you to meet your sales quota for plenty reasons such as promotions, avoid pay cuts and hours, or maybe even termination.  Sometimes, the sales quota can be very frustrated because everyone is on the go trying to get a customer but other than that it's a great place to work."
good,"I enjoy working here, ive learned so much everyone is friendly."

good,High customer service focus.  Generating new business and servicing client base.  Cross-selling and loss prevention.  High energy atmosphere to make the sales goals.  I loved my customers and they loved me.  The hardest part of the job was returns and turning the return into a sale.  Very rewarding and always being on your game.  I loved this job because I was always moving.
good,"My experience with Dillards  was a great experience and I would like to think that our store manager had a lot to do with that. I worked the Ridgeland,Ms. store and our store manager gave out a lot of positive energy throughout the store. He was very hands on. It was as if he made it a priority  to make sure he knew all of his employees by name. Constantly he would walk the floor commending workers and literally pat you on the back for jobs well done. It is very seldom  you find a manager that makes not only the managerial staff feel important but all of the employees as whole. Our store was always number one in the district in sale and open credit accounts and that was because we had a manager that kept up the morale of his employees and made sure management paid attention to our needs issues and concerns. In return we were willing to go above and beyond to make sure every selling event was a success and also did everything we could to make our sales. He taught us how to work together effectively as a team. The hardest part about the job was doing the over night inventory count unlike other companies that pay someone else to come in we have to do our own store wide inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was working weekends. Our manager had this saying If We Are Gonna Work Weekends We Gotta have Fun.

good,"they don't respect the time managing or ""bad scheduelling""."
good,"Some Management team members are clicky. However when it comes to their areas they do their job well The Store Manager was amazing,involved  dedicated"
good,The atmosphere was inviting. I felt like the management team was very helpful and hands on. The co-workers pull together as a team very well. Overall it was a good experience.
good,This is a job that's great for somebody who wants just a temporary job. You have to meet quotas and they expect you to be professional which is understandable. This is a great job for somebody who wants to start out in Retail or someone who is in college.
good,I started off in the children's department before I was promoted to the Sales Watch Specialist. My job was to keep the merchandise neat for the quests to attract their eyes and increase sales. Quotas were difficult to reach in watches. So I would also sale jewelry as well.

good,Working with Dillard's was a great experience for me. It allowed me to grow and learned a lot of things. As a Business Manager it helped me to improve my skills in Management and in decision making in the work field. It also allowed to be part of the team. Especially in our Department its fun and challenging.
good,Relaxed environment with opportunity for advancement. Pay is based on a base salary on top of sales and credit card applications. Management made participation incentives for employees.
good,"Dillard's is a family owned store.  They give holiday's off, which is great, and you can expect to see the Dillard's son's personally come to check out the stores often, which I love.  I can't speak for the company as a whole, but out location was difficult to attract full price shopper, and with the threat loaming over our heads of termination, it did make for a stressfull non commission position  Other than that I loved it, and it was great.  My management and co-workers well great people and  I am blessed for my experience at Dillard's."
good,Good place to work for retail. Which they would offer full time position for my job role. Good paying job for retail. Some benefits offered for part time workers but not much.
good,A typical day at work was usually slow. As a worker you were required to have a Quota each day to meet. Most days meeting it was quite difficult when not many people came in to shop. Weekends were the busiest days.
good,"Working at Dillards was great I loved the managers ,associates and job. I would highly recommend to anyone that this is a great place to work. The hours are flexible and could work with anyone’s schedule."
good,I don’t have much to say but I loved what I did. I worked in the women’s department as a watch specialist but wasn’t limited to anything else in the sales floor. Fun and competitive. Get a long w your coworkers so y’all don’t fight for sales.
good,worked there for almost a year it was nice but having a sale goal everyday witch would also change and add on the rest of ur sale goal u did not sell on to the new goal was awful head management was not great supervisor was a amazing  discount amazing
good,"Dillard's gives many opportunities to go higher in positions. The pay raises are amazing once you meet your sales per hour (SPH) goal. Good team work in the department, always helping each other out."
good,"Overall a decent job but time off is never granted. Management overall only cares about sales and not your personal life, time off outside of your 2 days per week will never be approved so if you are a social person or enjoy traveling often, this job is not for you."
good,For a part-time it's a good job. It's sometimes stressful because we have to meet the quota for each day that you are working if not you will be fired
good,"A disclaimer, I am not a typical Dillard's employee. I am a camera operator who strictly observes what goes on and tries to prevent injuries and thefts. "
good,"when you work at dillards you will know how restrict they are about being late a min or 2 , so that a big deal, even know it was named the toughest company in usa, but i enjoyed being so disciplined and on time"
good,"The hardest part of the job was to make a quota. "
good,"Dillards is a great company to move up with if you are willing to relocate. They like to promote from within, as well as hire from outside the company. The hardest part of the job  for sales associates is balancing the tasks with maintaining the sales per hour program. The most enjoyable part as a manager is developing new talent, merchandising to build sales, and hosting events."
good,"It was a great place to work, had great management, and a fantastic atmosphere. The only issue i ever had working here, was that they had a cap on our hours except for the employees who had seniority and had been grandfathered in from before the hour cap."
good,I really enjoy working for Dillard's. They allow me to have time off when needed and really work around everyone's schedule. They have competitive pay.
good,I left the job for family reason but I love to work there...after that I applied so many times for job but they didn't call me...I'm really good in computer and social media..
good,Helping customers find what they need with in a reasonable amount of time. It was competitive to try and reach your sales goal considering they were so high for the volume of sales that the store did in general.
good,It was a seasonal position and was a great challenge due to the rush of customers buying presents.It was frustrating at times and very rewarding at others. Helping people find the right thing was always fun.
good,"Opening and Closing and making sure all employees are pumped up and ready to sell. Management was A1 they have goals like everyone else. The hardest part was no days off and when you were off, they would call you to come in. The best part was interacting with all the customers, and finding their needs."
good,I learned to be a key player and self motivated. The most enjoyable part of the job was being accountable for work production on a personal level. A typical day involved fast paced production.
good,"I loved my time at Dillard's and would recommend to anyone to work for Dillard's. The workplace culture was a great ""Melting Pot"" I worked with people from different  backgrounds and cultures. We were and are family."
good,There are so many great things about working at Dillard's. I loved it! You got compensation for your sales plus they paid very well starting at $12 hourly. It was just a chill and fun place to work.
good,"A typical day at Dillard's meant keeping the prices, discounts and advertisements in check, resetting the floor arrangement, always setting up new displays, and always, always taking care of clients/numbers."
good,"great work environment"
good,"Working for Dillard's was an awesome opportunity. Unfortunately, meeting the 2k/day quota was just not possible in my town. We did not have enough incoming customers to support such a high quota."

good,very fun environment. Manger really nice. Very customer service oriented. Better have sale experience or they wont believe in you or advance you. but other than that loved it.
good,Great company to work for. The best management and co-workers as well. All were very helpful. Never a dull moment while working. Very safe environment
good,"Dillard's allows or requires you to be entrepreneurial. Your job as a Store Manager is to hire, train, maintain service and presentation standards which is the norm for dept. store management. The expectation this company has is that you will analyze and negotiate unique product for your store demographics. "
good,"Love my job here only down fall no raises and only part time available to dock employees. "
good,"working at dillards is great, my only concern is being able to get paid every week is not as great as it is may seem. the co-workers are most part very helpful when starting put, but having to make a quota is not as easy as it may seem because when having older people there they feel like it is the job to make all of the sales and some of them feel as if they are entitled to all customers,new and old, and that is the quickest way to lose your job,"
good,"Friendly, helpful  and fun! management was extremely helpful and the training program for the line was amazing, the  encourage you to try their products which made it easier for you to make a sample and meet your quota"
good,"A typical day at work was mostly a steady pace not too busy work day. Families coming in to look around, employees smiling and helping different customers find what they need. I learned things like respect, working in retail sound be a requirement for everyone so they can understand the way they talk to workers is a big part of the job sometimes. Management was always there when you needed them in a situation to help resolve it. The hardest part was the customers and dealing with different type of people, because not everyone comes in with kindness and respect, but the customers were also the most enjoyable part as well because some of them would be so kind and could sometimes make the sun come out on my rainy day. The customers could make or break my work day."
good,"I had the best manager anyone could find! She was my age. She went to my school. She was such a wonderful and great leader! She had a heart for her workers, and her environment showed that!"
good,Dillards is a good place to work for. The products are very high and of good qualities. The people are fun to work with and the ambience is very professional.
good,Sales were down the year 2016 due to many online shoppers.  New management is reorganizing and exercising retail cutbacks.  The retail industry @ Dillard's in Beachwood Place Mall were down.
good,"Dillard’s, Jonesboro, AR 						June 2015- July 2015"
good,"Dillards was a place for me to grow in so many ways, it was sort of overwhelming. The cosmetic Manager that was in charge of all the departments saw a potential in me and within 3 months of my hard work and great management skills, she promoted me. She trusted me with my very own Counter that I built from scratch! It was one of the new concepts they wanted to try and she put me in charge of it. Every day was exciting for me because I was able to hire my own hand picked Team! And raise them to be successful Sales Representatives and Excellent Makeup Artists. "
good,"A morning pep talk to get you going, management really cares about the qaulity of work that their employees put out, but they also care about sale, and you must reach a certain goal to remain employed with Dillard's."
good,I liked to work at Dillard's because of the sales quota that I liked to meet everyday. I love to sell cosmetics because I get to try new products and do makeovers. Management wasn't real good though.
good,i enjoyed working at Dillards and they have a very pleasant working environment but  Due to the high sales goal is unfortunately why I decided to move on from the company
good,Great job and great weekly pay. Good for anyone looking for something part time or supplemental. Shifts are usually 4-5 hours a day and cap at 28 hours a week.
good,I loved my job and most of my co workers. i started working there with no manager for my first 3 months and during holiday time. I was not happy woth the way things started out but was given a great and effective manager and would go back.
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Dillard's is, staying up to date on all the fashion and upcoming trends. Always great to work with customer, and management was always supportive and great at team building."
good,"Working a shift at Dillards is very rewarding in meeting all kinds of different people. I have learned to find out what customers real needs are and handle them all differently based on conversation and prospecting the sale. "
good,"A typical day at work was rewarding and challenging the company was based on productive sales, general sale promoting and ensuring that every customer was serviced accurately. The hardest part would be if there was every inclement weather which would  cause for a decrease in sales."
good,"Like another job you will get from it what you invest in to it , a lot of people would complaint about sph quota but I coached my teams to see it as customer service reflected in to a sale not the other way around it really reflects in to your numbers and quality of service like that"
good,"Customers always come first! I love the friendly staff members and the ability to advance and grow. "
good,"Perform duties consist of selling to customers and establishing a customer related basis. "
good,goals need to be met or you will be fired in a matter of a couple of months. It is a rewarding job and easy to move up with good sales skills.
good,"Typically, I was responsible for shipping/receiving and catering to the needs of the sales associates in a position called ""dock.""  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in an environment where my time was spent in a variety of different areas doing a variety of different tasks.  Such a diverse job was a little difficult because the expectations from management were unclear."
good,"always helping customers through out the day, always working backstock and making sure that the sales floor was spotless, management was always around when you needed it, my co-workers wer always there to help, when you couldnt find a certain item the customer wanted, i loved customers"
good,This was a wonderful place to work everyone was very friendly and willing to help out each other. We had and amazing cosmetic manager. Wish I could say that for the rest.
good,"I enjoyed,working at  Dillards.I was familiar with many customers there,having a shoe store they followed me to Dillards.It was a great environment,and the management was excellent.The hardest part of the job was making the monthly quotas,unfortunately I was there when our USA was going through a downward spiral economically."
good,"A typical day is answering phones, transfering phone calls, assisting customers with shopping, cash handling, opening and closing registars."
good,"Everyday is different you know it doesn't matter who the manager is that opens or closes something always happens. It could be an associate that makes everything better or a customer that brightens your day. No day is structured like the military. We like to have fun, but of course keep it professional. The only hard thing is trying to upsell some items. When a customer comes in and wants just THAT they don't want you to offer them THIS. The thing I loved about my job was the customers! Being able to make everyone happy, or at least try to make everyone happy. i had a customer make me cry one time of course they where for JOY!"
good,"Dillard's provides a great place for anyone who is interested in Retail. I manage the Salon & Spa. The energy is great. Awesome management team. Good sense of family, and togetherness."
good,It was a very enjoyable place to work. Though it does lack advancement opportunities and management isn't always the most knowledgeable. I wouldn't recommend this to be a long-term employment option.
good,"On a typical workday there are plenty of work challenges for learning new things pertaining to this retail job. Management of the floor and customers requires a willingness to be challenged and stay positive even if the customer flow is slow. I believe that quotas are reasonable and usually encourage me to be challenged if I should fall behind. It usually creates just enough anxiety to keep me pushing to do better. Sometimes. there is a bit of moodiness from fellow workers but interaction usually allows us to share the load and motivate each other to not give up and succeed together. This job also offers plenty of opportunity to exercise other gifts of creativity and time management. I have enjoyed it mostly. I have been through family crisis' while working and have found the challenge of keeping things professional a positive way to overcome personal setbacks. It helped me re-establish personal goals from day to day until I was back on my feet. I also found the management and staff very compassionate and helpful during these times. It is a challenging job, but I believe that this company offers great pay and they simply expect great performance. It has been an opportunity for personal and professional growth for me. I am thankful for my job at Dillards. I look forward to engaging with customers and offering them quality products and great service.  I am motivated to do my best and have an opportunity to advance to new departments and learn new things."
good,"Dillard's is a company that I will forever be grateful for. This company is where I learned who I am as a person and employee. I was able to have some of my ideas heard and implemented throughout the store. As well I learned to listen, respect and appreciate other coworkers ideas and views. Through which, I gained strength in my ability to talk to customers. I am thankful to Dillard's because I gained two amazing friends from being employed. I must say that it was challenging when I was promoted and my friend felt left behind. However, the joy of sharing in our experiences together is the most memorable."
good,Loved working at dillards...Mangement is great. Employee discount is generous and the guest are easy to work with

good,"I would start my day by clocking in at the computer and walking out to the sales floor. I learned how to be a better sales person with costumer service. I learned how to up sales and strive to make my daily sales goal. Management was great, always a manager when you needed one. The hardest part of my job I think was trying to keep my area not look cluttered and neat for the costumers, the only reason was we had a lot of inventory and no storage room for keep back stock. I enjoyed all the people I worked with."
good,"Made retail sales. Balance cash register. Place stock on floor for sales. Tag sale items. Worked to help wherever needed."

good,This is a great company to work for I've learned to work together as a team and not just by myself. Get to meet a lot of interseting people and get to put a smile on someones face daily. I just need more money and a chance for advancement.
good,"Learned about retail inventory, sales and managment."
good,Managers in my department were very helpful. My co-workers were easy to get along with. Work at Dillard's taught me how to have patience. The hardest part of the was when you could not satisfy a customer no matter how hard you tried. I really enjoyed interacting with the different people I encounterd while employed at Dillard's.
good,"A typical day includes a floor walk with Management to be informed of floor changes, new stock, signage and visual aids that have to be posted. Those tasks were divided up amongst the merchandising team. You also have to be informed of sales adds, start and end dates for in store promotions. A typical day could also include changing maniquins, showcase windows, sourcing props from visual room and product from the different departments. Also accounting for any inventory that was placed into a visual display and the location throughout the store. As a merchandiser you have to have a keen eye, see when product has sold through and needs to be rotated, when displayed need to be organized, restocked. My co-workers worked as a team we discussed presentation ideas and indulged each other's creativity. There was little imput from management, they depended on our visual and creative aptitude to enhance the store and to drive sales. The hardest part of the job was that there was hardly much downtime, there was always something to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to be creative, and a sense of pride when your stores look visually appealing."
good,"Sales associate assist customers with purchase mark downs markups,inventory, overall assisting customers! I learned that no matter how mean people really are just keep on smiling it will rub off on them, The job was not hard just the you had to meet your quota by the end of the day or they take $1.00 of your pay, other than that the mos enjoyable part of the job was providing exceptional customer service."

good,At Dillards and a sales associate you mustn't be shy you have to socialize with clients and be open minded to anything that's thrown your way . Your goal is to help the customer find exactly what they need and provide great customer service.
good,"While employed at Dillard's, we began our day with daily goals. I learned about a variety of brands and was able to up sell with my knowledge.

good,I take pride in being a camera operator. Working here instilled integrity and loyalty to my company. Reporting to management things going on around the store they can’t see.
good,Dillard's is a really good company. Working at dillard's it's like working with family. The only thing is they do not pay a lot. There's no benefits for Dillard's clearance center.
good,"I was a personal Shopper and really enjoy working with people. Customer service  , customer satisfaction was one of my main goals. I take my Customer service expertise very serious."
good,Dillards is a fun place to work with. But working with certain people who wants to take all the sale was annoying and bothersome. everyone could sell its just  lack of customers being loyal and the fact that there was a limit of sales item per customer was not followed.
good,"The pay is variable, depending on the speed in which the tasks are completed. Anyone can learn about the process of receiving and distributing products by being inquisitive. A typical day consists of receiving, processing, and/or distributing goods. The management team seems to be very understanding and flexible with employees for the most part. Overall this is an enjoyable environment to work in."
good,"The typical day at Dillard's was fun, I met a lot of people from different cultures and assisted them with their needs.  Friendly atmosphere most of the time.  I learned a lot about different people.  Management there is pretty typical, nice working relationship with everyone."

good,I left due to hostile work environment and management failed to take care of this issue and it got worse after I spoke with management and went the chain of command to correct the problem them manager did not want to address this issue

Management also had food delivered if the store did well and celebrated holiday events at work if the store was open.

good,"With my time working there I had an amazing working experience. The people were so friendly and happy all the time. Management was fun to be around, unless there was a truck and we had to unload it within a certain time frame. Wake up around 6 in the morning to get to work on time at 7 am. Was about a 20-25 minute drive everyday to work. Get there and clock in. Ask around with other fellow employees that work in the warehouse what they want to do for the morning. Either unlock the doors and pickup trash both upstairs and downstairs or clean the bathrooms. We had about a one hour to clean bathrooms/ trash from the sales floor. After we finished that we had to vacuum the sales floor since it was carpet. We would have to make sure the floors were nice and clean all the time. I learned how to use different machines such as a floor polisher, pallet jack, buffer, etc. The managers and supervisor were very friendly. We would chat from time to time when the day was going good and we were getting things done quickly. I get along with co-workers very well. They were all so nice and so happy all the time. A very good environment to be around. I loved everything about this job. Working in the warehouse is what I like to do personally. I am a hands on type of person. Like to help others when they need help. I like to kind of take charge when no one else is doing so. I don't like to be behind a desk or stay in one place for continuous hours at a time. I like to walk around and be fast paced with work."
good,This was not like work at all. The work atmosphere was professional and fun. Great overall experience.
good,Estee Lauder is a wonderful company to work for a great learning experience and outstanding people to work with.
good,Dillard's is wonderful company to work for. There is always room for promotions with management. Co- workers are extremely nice and helpful to new hires as well.
good,"Dillard's is a fantastic place to work. The management is constantly helping sales associates improve their performance. Sales associates have the ability to make as many sells as their hearts desire. Customer service is a definite must, and really helps you exceed your quota for the day and/ month. Each sales associate has goals for themselves daily and monthly. When these goals are met they are rewarded with a pay increase. Hard work truly pays off. Co-workers are your competition truly but do help complete tasks of changing features and getting the sales floor in perfect shape for customers. Unfortunately, customers are where you make your sales, so when there are slow days with very limited customers sales are hard to come by. These slow days are great ways to take advantage of big projects such as: cleaning, changing features, or detail zoning. The most enjoyable part of the job is the reward of seeing the customer's face being truly happy with their purchases. Shopping makes people happy, and when the customer is happy with their purchases it really makes you feel good! It is also a reward to reach or go beyond your goal it makes you feel achieved."
good,"I have always work well with my co-workers and always available "
good,Provide excellent customer service. Inform customers of latest styles and fashion trends. Work in a team environment to meet department and individual sales goals.
good,"Working for this company has been a great experience to add to my employment history and techniques. This job was present to me as an challenge once I was offer the position, only because each associate and business manager are given a sales quota goal to achieve before the end of the shift. Goals are set according to your pay rate, in order to obtain a raise with the company you have to exceed your sales quota by 10%.  This job requires a lot of multitasking, such as being capable to have a positive attitude towards customers, and colleagues. Constantly maintaining your merchandise, sales area, fitting rooms, floor directives, mark downs, visual collateral, and still having the ability to assist all customers with questions, fitting rooms, and sales transactions."
good,I loved working here because it allowed me to meet different people and interact and help them to get what they were looking for. The stores are so beautiful organized and decorated that you feel part of a magazine.
good,Great location in the mall . i wished theyed hire me back. they push you to better your sales experience then promote you
good,"When have over my sales for today that's a great day for me and the store. I have learn how to become more a leader working for Hayneville Beauty Supply . The management is good. We all had a good time at work and got the job done. When you can't meet your sale goal for that day. The most enjoyable part of the job Great Customer Service , Sales, and interacting with the customer helping them find what they looking for. I was the Assistant Manager."
good,Here I packed boxes for half the time I was there and then I moved to a clerical position. Packing boxes was actually alright but then again I tend to look on the bright side of everything. The work was systematic. The faster you packed the better your quota was and the more money you made. I learned to wrap a gift like an expert. Management had some problems getting along with each other which  affected the moral of the employees poorly. My co-workers were all very nice. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we kept each other motivated.
good,"Fun, Challenging, management is good  and fun to work with."
good,Most days at work all I have to do is sale. I have to compete with six other associates for sales in my area. Sometimes the department is predicted to only sale two thousand and each associate has to sale about thirteen hundred so it makes for good competition. It's also one of the hardest parts of the job because you have to be kind of ruthless to get your sales. Being in such a competitive environment has also taught me a lot of things. I have really learned how to multitask so I can make sure to see customers before my co workers. I also need to have great customer service so they will keep shopping with me. I love helping customers find what they need and helping them find what they didn't know they needed.
good,Working at Dillards was very fast paced and demanding.  It literally catapulted my career as a designer/merchandiser.
good,I would help customers with their clothing purchases and help them open credit accounts.  I learned how to deal with diverse people.  I enjoyed working with the variety of people who worked there.  The hardest part of the job was opening credit accounts during hard economic times.

good,Typical day was a day of meeting new and old customers that wanted a great product.
good,"Began the day with greeting and helping customers find products they loved and thus came back for repeat business, The most favorite thing I liked about this job were the relationships I had with my customers! I learned I didn't need to ""try to sell"" as it just came very naturally and was not forced. I also learned that good customer service is extremely important as it draws business and keeps business. If you don't have the customer what have you got?"
good,"Must be on time,always given something new to do,learn alot. manage very well . working with other is taskful sometime but it work for me. Thank god at the in of the day,everything went well."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Dillard's in the Men's clothing department. This wasn't a very demanding or difficult job but it is rewarding, offering quick advancement opportunities to successful employees. You are paid hourly in most Sales Positions excluding Shoes and Suits. The rate of starting pay is better than most clothing retailors but is by no means great. Although you are NOT paid commissions, you must sell a certain amount each month to prevent your hourly pay being reduced. That was a different approach to me but my pay was never reduced, as I never feel below my goal sales. The Best part of working at Dillard's (other than an employee discount) is definitley the management. They respect and value their employees and are more than willing to work with you on anything. The hardest part of the job is sometimes having an inconsistant schedule or getting more hours if working in a location where most of their long-term employees get their pick of hours. However, I respect that they offer this perk to employees that have provided years of work. My typical day started with the daily staff meeting before the store opened. During this meeting we reviewed upcoming sales goals, areas we could improve, recent sales, upcoming promotions and holidays, and any other information. After the meeting everyone reports to their area (Men's clothing) and sets up the cash register. Next, you put out new ships of clothing and continuously straighten up clothes (fold, hang, etc.). You assist any customers and suggest or upsell articles as you go. I will say the general clothing"
good,"Dillard's was a high energy, productive and fast moving company that I enjoyed working for after I graduated from College. The management was clever, my co-workers were great too.

good,I have worked for Dillards for six years. I have enjoyed gettting to know my customers and co workers. Working in this type of retail enviroment has opened my mind and has made me the person I am today. My customers have become like family to me and so many of them have touched my heart. My goal is to make someone feel good about themselves.
good,Loved the people I worked with. loved the company and wish I was back there.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dillard's Inc. It is a good place to work, I learn a lot. I loved beening Counter Manager, I enjoyed working with all the co-workers from day-to-day. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours in the day to be there. The enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers, and working in the different department of the store. Because Dillard's is such a G-R-E-A-T Store you get to meet all kinds of people from state to state, one thing about Dillard's is the good quailty in taste of merchandise and the people will drive that extra mile just to shop at Dillard's. I wish I was still there, I miss serving the customer's I love Dillard's."

Management I can say was one of the stores strongest points. The co-workers that I had in my department were all very cooperative and understanding for the most part. We all got along extremely well.

good,As long as you are involved and looking for advancement you will probably find it. But you need to get to know the higher ups fairly quickly. Most of the time we were required to set up displays by ourselves with just a little direction. This helps show off what you are capable of as well as shows work ethics. Management helps wherever needed. Mostly.

good,"You are paid based on your work."
good,It had its busy and very slow days. Sundays are always the busiest no matter what time of month it is. I learned how to perfect my sales selling techniques. Management is very understanding no matter the situation they try to work with you as much as possible. The workplace can be competitive but that is because of the daily sales goals that are needed. Hardest part of the job would be making your goal when there are a lot of people scheduled at the same time on a slow day. But the most enjoyable part would be watching kids be happy with their selection ( I worked in the kids department)
good,"I worked in shipping /receiving dept. Were on our own, basically. Made our own decisions as to what needed to be done for the day. Management was very supportive of this dept. They were always there and available to hear any situations that might concern us."

good,The managers work well around your schedule. You get paid time and half for working certain holidays even on your birthday. The starting pay is great and if you sell great you get raises.
good,"dillards is a great place to shop. they have the best deals, shopping there on holidays are the best, being able to help customer find what they need and helping them find what to wear and how to smell, is  was a great feeling,"
good,Great place to work if you're good at talking to people and selling merchandise. Can be stressful trying to make sales quotas; you may getting pay cuts if you're not making your quotas but you also have the possibility of getting raises. You get three raise reviews during your first 9 months and once every year after.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dillard's, they are a wonderful company to work for. They have wonderful service and the management are very nice and always know how to help you in any way possible."

In return your work efforts will be rewarded. Dillards honors its employees and customers often.
good,"What I learned:"
good,There is no chance for advancement. Unloading and loading trucks was the most enjoyable part. The hardest part of the job was moving equipment by yourself.
good,Very productive place to work the discounts on clothes are very convenient and enjoyable. It's a good career choice that would help you move up in your career.

good,"Very fun and interesting place to work. The management is amazing and so are the employees. Very friendly and helpful. Learned so much about clothing, fashion, and how to help customers find happiness in what they buy. You are able to make more and more money based on your work ethic and commissions. Managers are very helpful in selling tips and strategies. It can be very competitive which I enjoyed and can be tough when the store is slow."
good,"Choice in positions. Flexible schedule. Great pay. Great management. Fun.A lot of bonuses, commission and incentives for achieving your sales goal. nice people."
good,"upper management sucks, they care more about the numbers than the do about the employeees. never come around with a smile.THIS IS AT THE SOUTHAVEN STORE. store manager and her assistant walk around showing the employees stress, ,you could say good morning and they could be looking in your face and wouldn't say a word. the assisatant manager would always leave early never in his office. i was told they always had an open door policy. not true at all."
good,The thing that I liked most about this job was the challenge of making your sales goals and being able to help customers at the same time.they encouraged you to think outside the box and offered you tools to succeed. They also rewarded you each quarter with merchandise that you could earn in the department that I worked in. They also had two times a year when you were able to get a sneak peak at the upcoming season so that you were aware of the merchandise that was coming so that you could prepare a list of your client base to show each item to.

good,"I loved working with Dillard's! The management was great, the benefits were AWESOME, and the pay was everything if you were a full-time employee. What I loved the most about my job there was interacting with the customers and meet new and different varieties of people."
good,"My work day consisted of stocking merchandise, keeping inventory and being able to sell the merchandise to customers. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job were both the fact that there weren't too many customers. Not too many customers meant not meeting the quota but also it gave time to stock merchandise."
good,"A typical day working at Dillard's was an enjoyable competitive experience making my sales goals. Typically, everyday I would go in to work and have a meeting, learning about what's new in Dillard's and what our sales were, then I would go on to working my sales area (which was hand bags and accessories) and make sure all the displays were neat and all the displays were meeting company policy of how the display's should be marketed, while doing that I greeted customers with a friendly energetic attitude and assisted them in finding whatever it was they were shopping for and expanding their purchases, making sure they had an excellent shopping experience at Dillard's. I would also give my best effort to try to ensure the customers new my name in an effort to have repeat/ regular customers come back and ask for me. My co workers and I enjoyed working together, we would always motivate each other to reach or sales goals therefore it was a friendly competitive nature in the air that made for a productive fun work place. My hardest part of the job was not being able to sell items that were not in my area and having to give that customer to a sales associate that worked in that specific sales area. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping other people spend their money!"
good,"I loved working for Dillards Tulsa, professionalism was very high, awesome Managers and Store Manager - he was the best!!!  Colorado Springs Dillards are lacking in areas of professionalism and employee dedication!!!!!!  Sharon at Chapel Hills is a monster!"
good,"My typical day at work, great, I've learned a lot of interesting things about my job, and friendly people.  Management, they were there for us.

good,"I loved everything about this job! I learned a lot of techniques that I can apply in my everyday life. (I was a beauty consultant)  The managers were wonderful! They were understanding of my needs and worked with any time-off requests. The hardest part of my job was working on the holidays.  We had a lot of incentives to preform daily job tasks. For example, we had to pre-sale make-up and skin care; whoever sold the most received prizes of some sort.  We also received extra money on our paychecks for getting credit apps."

good,The most beautiful Dillard's I had ever seen. Everything was wonderful there. I regret having to move. It was fun and the people were wonderful. The managers were amazing at what they did. Everyone cared. Everyone motivated each other. The whole store was on a first name basis with everyone and it was not a small store! People working for people. Treating each other as professionals and getting paid well. I loved that store. The hardest part of any retail environment is keeping the goals met and raised from the previous year to ensure the ever growing success of a company. I don't fault Dillard's for being such a strict place at times. They have to because of how fun it is. People get lackadaisical if there's no one to remind them that it's still work. 
good,"Helped customers find what they were looking for,I love meeting and helping new people. My co workers became like family. Hardest part is when I seen a customer was'nt satisfied. Loved also doing makeup!"

good,Love it the the best place wish I can work there again very friendly people I miss every bit of it like the fact that I always was busy the bad thing was that I had to go cause my father in law had a stroke do to we are the only family he had to take care of him
good,I loved going in everyday with the intent of giving the best customer service to all sort of clientele. I learned so many different things especially with the product I was  selling. The management made the work environment an enjoyable place. Hardest part was when I was unable to satisfy the customers needs.  Meeting so many new people and being able to interact one on one with each client.
good,"Since your job depended on a sales quota which is the same basis for commissioned sales, you had to make your daily sales quota in order to keep your job. Therefore everyone fought for their sales and tried to prevent others from stealing your customers.  I made top sales 3 yrs. in a row by not stealing customers, but by giving great customer service and maintaining a personal work relationship with them."

good,Great company to work for. Upper management always willing to work with you. the only thing is everyone has to make their way up even though they are well qualified and well deserving but still dillards would not say a word until you ask for it.

good,"i enjoyed working for Dillard's. Some days are rougher than others but the knowledge i gained was rewarding. I learned so much working here. Most associates were easy to work with. Management was great, I feel like we had the best manager in the store. Retail is difficult but I find it enjoyable. What made the job enjoyable was being able to help people find what they re looking for. If it was a watch, or a piece of jewelry for themselves, seeing them satisfied with their choice because i helped them, that was the best. the hardest part of the job has to be being able to sell. Sales comes natural to me but sometimes people are just window shopping. its hard to get customers to buy in to the product when competitors have similar items with a lower price. Overall i learned and gained a lot of knowledge working here."
good,"A typical day would require one to make a the day or quota and keep the counter clean.  I learned a lot from that job customer service and sales techniques.

good,"As a beauty advisor your day starts bright and early. It is important to be at work on time and ready to assist customers with their needs, There was a lot of times when I had to get to the sales floor and I had new shipment and merchandise to accommodate and learn about. My department manager was always on track with everything and had the place running. I got to meet great people and work with them, the customers were also very friendly, I always kept my relations at a professional level. The hardest part of the job was when I was pressured to come up with very large amounts in sales, the goals were too extreme for the amount of business we had going. Even though I loved my job, it was stressful when they required almost 1 million in sales and I was the only one behind the counter. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I met great people, it was a great opportunity for me to work for the company and learn so much about many products."
good,I have learned to really be a better salesman and worker with great cultural people all around me. I had the best managers and coworkers who knew how to be a team player.

good,"A typical day at work required me to push me to learn to engage with customers and educate them on our skincare products. I enjoyed learning about the products and giving facials this way visually showing them how the products could make a difference in their skin. The hardest part was not having customers around at times, especially on Mondays. I learned to manage my time, memorize the products and their benefits and what skin types each one was designated for in order to advertise them to customers."
good,Working here I had multiple jobs but was primarily a sales associate. This was a good job to have while I was in school as they were very flexible with my schedule.
good,Good place to work for. It does have its days where its hard and stressful but what job doesn't? I enjoyed working there for the 2 years I was there. The only reason I left was to work full time at nights so I could go to school during the day. I would work there again anytime.
good,"I was always interacting with people, which is something I enjoy. Everyone was friendly and kind. I always felt safe and respected despite being a lot younger than everyone."
good,"convenient hours"
good,The most enjoyable part about my job was the fact that I worked in the children's department. The friendships that I created with other employees and customers have been unforgettable. I wouldn't say there are any hard parts about this job. I've never really had any difficulty with anything there. It is very professional and high end. I'd have to say that was one of my favorite things about Dillard's.

good,A typical day was really a quote on quote laid back day. I loved working here and management was awesome. Unlike other places we were treated like actually human beings/Adults. Our work got done on time and it was a great environment to be in.
good,It was good experience. I learned a lot. I gained a lot of training in merchandising.  They treated me fairly. The salary was ok and I needed more hours though.
good,The most common complaints we hear initially are the long work weeks. It is a change to be on a 49 hour work week from day 1 but with everything you do throughout the day a 49 hour week goes much quicker than a 40 hour work week at most other jobs. You truly get out what you put in!
good,"Dillard's is a great place to work. You learn about style, merchandise,colorizing,.Dillard's has taught me how to handle customers with a more different approach.if there is a problem get the manager never say no we can,t do it."

good,When you clock in you go into a room for the cameras and start your shift. By basically looking around the store at customers or even associates at the store if they're stealing.
good,"A busy day but a great day to work. No one is breathing down your neck to get work gone. They treat you like adults and treat you fairly. "

good,I loved working at Dillards and the opportunity to come in contact with so many people.   I learned the retail business.  The hardest part of the job was meeting your quota.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people. The management cared about its employees
good,Very friendly environment. Awesome managers. Great employees. Very fair when one is having problems. Very clean and organized. Great deals and promotions.
good,"Excellent training curriculum for future use. Very demanding when it comes to being on time. Offers discounts on top of sales promos, full insurance benefits, paid training, 2 weeks paid vacation per year for full-time employees, plaid holidays and days off with full time employees. A great place to work."
good,"It is a Fun workplace with lots of great employees. Management is great and very supportive. Positive atmosphere, will work there again if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"I started off working in the Customer service Unit of the company and later moved to the sales floor after about eight months.Dillards gives you room to move within the company and that I did experience within six months after I started working with them. I did learn a lot ranging from being a lot more comfortable dealing with customers to perfecting my selling skills. I have been on the sales floor now for about 18months and it has been a very rewarding experience. However the hardest part of the job is standing on your feet sometimes for as long as nine hours. That can be very tiring. Generally speaking however, working here as a high end retail company has given me the opportunity of meeting with so many different people, some have become very good friends, some I have learnt from, others  have been sources of encouragement to me."
good,I loved working here. I loved the environment and the unique people I was able to work with. The way that my schedule was set up made it easy to still be a full time student.
good,"i cant put into words how exciting and trilled i was to meet all the new people, there were so many great people, i walked to the beach and collected shells then the nice people helped me with my vision quest and gave the shells to the hungry children"
good,"nothing to say they are a goooood company to work for they pay based on your work, the more and better you work the more money you get nothing more to say"
good,Great place to work at for the amount you get payed. It is difficult to make money when the store has no traffic. They also want you to sale and merchandise so be ready not to sale.
good,"I work at Calallen High School with the Diagnostician"
good,Great place to work with good people. To be 100% honest to focused on looks and appearance rather than customer service and helping the people. Could have more associate interaction between departments.
