bad,the managers are lazy. this is the most depressing and toxic place the drama there is unbelievable. i quit because my manager kept yelling at me all night when i knew what my completed list was supposed to look like. she just kept telling me what to do the only time i saw her actually do her job that day is when i went on break. how are you supposed to be a manager when you take a smoke break every 5 minutes.
bad,I had a somewhat good experience for the two months that I was working there in the beginning then after that I started coming across some aggravating issues people stealing money coming up missing my hours coming up missing all of a sudden no one knew what happened to my hours just a load of stuff that I just built up over time
bad,"VERY toxic workplace.The turnover was astronomical,pay and hours horrible.The manager scheduled based on whether you were one of their ""favorites"" or not,and higher-ups didn't care.Lots of goofing-off by management and their buddies while others had to do all the work and work the nights and weekends.Absolutely no work-life balance.Everyone gets a quarter raise each year,whether they actually do any work or not-the catch is making it a year and putting up with the garbage you have to endure.Just don't do it!!!!"
bad,I would never recommend working for Dollar general. You are under paid and over worked not matter what position you are in. All they worry about is the bottom line not there employee's. That's why they have such a high turnover of employees. You are used for there benifit.
bad,Dollar General employees just stand around gossiping about one another nothing is organized first place I have ever worked for where you need Facebook to see a schedule change
bad,I worked so hard and put in so many hours of work but my checks kept getting cut. But of course I worked her When minimum wage was $7.25 I would give this job anothet shot
bad,This company could not care less about their employees. The work environment was down right dangerous. Hostile customers and co-workers abound at this company.
bad,Only 2 employees work in the store at any given time which is not safe. Which I believe makes the store an easy target for thieves. Customers are quite often irritated because they have to stand in line for so long to get checked out. This company does not give annual raises.
bad,They expect to much out of employees. You don’t get paid fairly. I love my boss mike he is a great boss but the company cares more for customers then employees. No support for workers.
bad,Terrible place to work. You have to endure the trashy customers that frequent such establishments to steal merchandise. You are unable to detain shop lifters. You are most of the time unable to prevent theft because only 2 associates work any given shift per DG standard operating procedures. Pay is low even for management team members due to budget cuts and expansion.
bad,"There is no mangment, they steal your pay but expect you to work over and coworkers are nasty towards others and the customers they serve. Not to mention when they get backed up like Center Township store did in Beaver County PA they start putting out, out dated food and they have rat/mice problems that they chose not to report or take care of."
bad,Dollar general in merrillan is awful. The management sucks. And no one is on the same page and man plays favorites. Overall the place is a joke and I do not recommend ever working there
bad,"When i first applied, it was fun and it was a little stressful. But the manager would talk behind your back and tell the other workers that you suck at your job and you need to quit."
bad,Dollar General is a horrible company to work for. Management is awful. Dms are awful. Hr is no help for harrasment or discrimination. I would never recommend anyone working here. Especially if you want to make decent money with decent hours.
bad,"Do not work for this company!  They work you like a dog for very little pay, no work home life balance... no sorry from upper management, and if your a manager all you well do is work work work, and don’t ever be sick because they don’t care, you come to work.  Your staff well call off on you all of the time and you will work open to close your yourself.  Horrible horrible company!!!!!!"
bad,Worst job experience ever. No training. No management. Rude upper management. Horrible response time. District manager knew nothing. Regional manager did nothing.
bad,Hours went from 25 to 7 and they couldn’t understand why I looked for another job. Was very rude to me and told me to sign up for food stamps. I was working there to feed my family and a person can not feed a family on 7 hours a week. My husbands disabled and disqualified for any type of welfare. Dollar General was the worst company I ever worked for.
bad,"They don't help you keep your job and if you a limitation, they use it against you in any way or form. Their pay sucks, no benefits, horrible hours, your fired for one no call no show, even if its not your fault or a miscommunication with the store. And if you tell the management at the store to help you succeed, they say NO, your on your own."
bad,"Managers talk about employees BADLY. sit on the phone & gossip all day. Don’t do any work, try to force cashier to do managers job. Does not work with you concerning the schedule. Overworked & underpaid."
bad,The company only care about how fast you get the orders filled and nothing else! If u not fast enough they are going to get rid of you!! The company has its “special” people that don’t do nothing at all while people like me pray every morning heading to work that I will have a job to come back to the next morning!
bad,"Never go to work at the Dollar general in Dublin,VA management is terrible there and they do drugs there and steal and so much more.everyone is quitting there.its a mess there too."
bad,When I worked here I was always working a least one dou le a week. I couldn't get alot done due to be the only manager on the floor and I never really got a break on busy days
bad,don't waste your time with dollar general the regional manager and DM are horrible. they don't care about anyone but them self and there numbers. They do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,The current manager is mean and spiteful. The hours are horrible and the workload is immense. Calling out for an emergency is unheard of. The managers offer no support or compassion.
bad,"The people I worked with were great, however the district manager treated everyone as if they were stupid, and was very disrespectful. Getting raises was non existent unless the company was in a bind. Hours are a struggle to get if you're looking for them. Hard to make a livable wage in this company"
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. Assistant management position was really a glorified stocker position. Upper management not helpful with training. Too much back stabbing, brown-nosing, and lying between store manager, district manager, and regional manager. Very little concern for employees."
bad,Too much work not enough money...don’t care about your safety...SM rarely have closing shift..and talk about you when ur doing a better job than them..and give you the worst schedule
bad,Over work under paided. Need mor organizations. Need to let employees know that they are wanted and needed.the assistant managers are the one running the store but the store manager receive the credit it’s just messy
bad,Stay away from dollar general. Its the worst company that does NOT help it's employees. It's all about the stock holder. They make you manage during your lunch while not being paid.
bad,"You don’t get paid much at all for the work you have to do! This job is a quick buck in your pockets, but it’s a lot of physical work & the pay isn’t worth it."
bad,"For the love of God, don't do this to yourself. It's beyond stressful. The store managers are terrible. So much bad within the company that the good is completely overlooked"
bad,"Working at Dollar General was a bitter-sweet situation for me, when I started there was no management at the store, training was minimal and there was little discipline or direction. It was hard to know what our tasks at hand were and many people got disciplined for things that were not there fault due to lack of information and training. Would love to go back if there was less stress and more organization."
bad,Don't work for them.never ever.worst company I've ever worked for .management is the worst.70 hr work week every week.store is in the worst location you can think of.
bad,I absolutely hated working for this company. All I did was run cash register. When I was let off to run stock I was told I didn't do anything when I worked product to the shelf. Very glad I found a new job.
bad,Very bad management poor customer service poor pay they don't care if you have a family emergency or sick. Still expect you to work. Co worker are non professional. Dirty store
bad,"Store Manager"
bad,Don’t do it it not worth it and you will never be able to please anyone there horrible experience and they don’t care for there employees and don’t pay
bad,It seems that at least the few locations I worked at had bad management overall.  The staff is never fully trained and usually understaffed which causes angry customers and overworked staff.
bad,The working hard part never getting a break didn't bother me.  Over worked and under paid. Management is horrible. They don't help. Transferred from a store who only the assistant store manager helped.
bad,"As an employer, Dollar General was the worst company I've ever worked for. There's no flexibility and managers play favorites. I would never work for them ever again. They do not care about employees or their families. They only care about how much money they can make. Their District Managers are no better than their store managers"
bad,"KEEP ALL your clock in/out slips.Always verify your hours with your paystub, make sure vacation  hrs aren’t taken away. Will take to cover store hours"
bad,When I first started almost three years ago I love my job. They lied about promotions they lied about my hourly pay to get me to start had me for feeling roles that I wasn't being compensated for such as key holder and assistant manager their managers are told to lie at the interview
bad,They are very shady and break many labor laws and want you to do the same and they give no training and they will not ever listen to you if you have a complaint
bad,I was a college student at the time or working here online. I had saved up money to go on a vacation and was told I could be off for 3 days when there was 4 other full time workers that would have taken my hours but the manager wouldn’t let them.
bad,Was awful and disappointing the manager was unfair to some better to others cutting our hours also all the time most of the time working there she was giving more time to the ones that she wanted and some workers only got eight hours a week that’s not a JOB the male key holder was flirty and disrespectful also he got away with everything all the time bc he was a key holder jobs was not worth it ever
bad,Their outlook is blurred. It was impossible to achieve results to MY standards of what a store should look like. Full of broken promises. My direct supervisors understood the situation but their hands were tied as well. The company is really broken and the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. I felt it was not beneficial to stay. You can’t fix that which does not accept its broken. Whashame
bad,"No work life balance min pay and hours, no self improvement available , no hours available to improve how the store looks when you only get 100 hours payroll to run AN ENTIRE STORE , you have to fill in the other 80 hours a week needed to run these stores!!!!!!!!!"
bad,The manager quit which left assistant manager in charge and first key holder was running the store and the work environment was very chaotic. The assistant manager was not prepared to run the store
bad,Very poor moral at this company. Doesn’t care for their employees at all. I would not recommend this place if employment to my worst enemy. I loved my job but budget cuts made it hard to get anything done.
bad,"There really isn't much to say. The managers get swapped monthly, the employee's come and go, the head managers adopt a do nothing attitude and the employee's are generally left alone in a rush."
bad,Started in 2015. After the new district manager took over the whole region turned sour. Watch who your DM is.... They make or break it................
bad,I worked there for about a month before I got kicked out of my house and had to move to far away to continue to work there. I was also blamed for putting up stock wrong when it was my coworker.
bad,Horrible company! Horrible DM.. horrible horrible horrible!!! DM has bad ppl working for him! You go to him about it.. nothing happens.. you become the problem. Managers adding breaks to ya time card to meet budget when you didn’t take a break..just over al bad bad bad.. too much work not enough time and definitely not enough pay!!
bad,"The kayos I experienced at DG was straight up jealousy from my managers. They didn’t want to train me or teach me properly  nor the other staff at the store.  everyone has the right to have the knowledge in regards of how to increase to the next level/higher pay, benefits, & opportunities available to them, instead of someone holding them back. Yet I experienced completely unacceptable behaviors from management atAt each store I worked at"
bad,"You start off as part of the team. I worked my way up from p/t cashier to assistant Manager.  Then fell out of the ""click"" NEVER received any training as an assistant,  since not being in the click. Quit and haven't been happier!"
bad,"Unsafe working conditions "
bad,"Worked there for a whole two months; was fired because I couldn’t properly work the cash register due to the lack of training I was barely given. Pay was horrible, workload was horrible, management was the worst, co-workers were “eh” at best, and the most amount of hours I was given one week was literally 12 hours. This isn’t even a decent part-time job."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody really unless youre really needing a job. They expect you to do so much for so little of pay. its not the funnest time there.
bad,"I handled cash, stocked the shelves, took care of the customers. Straighten out the shelves. Slept the floors, mopped the floors. Put the products away where they belonged to. Helped customers"
bad,This place was a horrible experience. Belittled and talked down too. Work is never good enough. You will be yelled at by district manager in front of employees and customers. Full time is barely 32 hours a week. The pay is horrible for what is expected of you.
bad,I was able to work at Dollar General for a year or so. I stared out as a cashier and ended with being keyholder/manager. I worked part-time due to already having a full time job.
bad,This place does not pay well plus the unfair working conditions that the employees have to endure then the demand on labor hours and never given enough time to complete any jobs
bad,I will never work at dollar general again! The manager was horrible!!  I just have nothing nice to say about her or working at dollar general..worse experience ever..
bad,I guess it would all depend on the location because the one I work at in another town was wonderful moved here and it was okay at first but the employees like to talk about each other to customers me when I'm not there
bad,this place is not a place you want to work at the management sucks some of the employers there are only there to make fun of other people even worse of custumers .For shopping wise nothing is where its suppose to be or for weeks they don't have it in all honesty save your money an go somewhere else !!!!
bad,"This is by far the worse company I have EVER worked for and I work for some low companies in my time. You would think that a job that was literally in my front yard and that pays every week would be a dream come true, right?   This company is powered by some of the worst leadership in the workforce!"
bad,Very rude wont work with you and doesnt care about the customers. They are ungrateful and talk behind your back about you and make you feel lower then dirt and embrassed you in group chats.
bad,"This company is a soul sucking machine. The pay is way too low for the amount of responsibility they put on you. The only difference between the leads, assistant managers and manager is the pay. As a lead you perform 95% of the manager functions but get paid .50 cents more an hour than a regular associate. As for hours, if you aren't willing to go to other stores and out of your county to work at other stores, dont expect over 10-15 hours a week."
bad,"Disorganized, poor management. Yelled at employees and called them horrible nicknames. Schedules for the weekend were given out on Friday night. Schedules for week days were made available on Sunday night."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy, if I had one! Horrible work life balance. 6 day work week even for Dist. Mgrs. Low payroll, low wages, highly physical. Often employees, especially managers, have to work alone...so no breaks or lunches!!! Business model does not care about employee engagement."
bad,"Single coverage"
bad,"Store management and most of the staff were pushy and hostile. Manager doesn't have patience for training, never a set schedule, and cannot keep employees because of constant belittling and harassment in front of customers and other employees."
bad,"At first I was excited to work there but at time went on I couldn't stand it and let me explain. Dollar general in not good at keeping employees because of how bad the management is. We went through 3 managers, 2 assistant manager and almost all the key holders left. At one point there were three people working that store. Me and 2 others. They then work you like there is not tomorrow and expect so much out of you in a 4 hour time period. On top of that I honestly think I wasn't getting paid enough for my time there.exp"
bad,This was the worst job I ever had  they do not care about you as a person or your quality of life versus your job the job was all that mattered. I enjoyed the customers and what I did just not how you were treated
bad,Don't care about you and the management needs more training and development skills. They got a bad system with their policies and procedures. They work you don't have a family to go home to.
bad,Dollar general is such a scam when it comes to pay. Even in management as a key holder or shift leader you will only make 8.25. They will not work with your schedule nor do they care. The customers depending on which area you are in can be quite questionable and the company itself does not care about your safety. Only money.
bad,Was ripped off at least 1 hour out of every pay check. Out on medical leave for heart surgery did everything right and they gave up my position and expected me to work at different locations for lower pay
bad,I’ve worked in two separate districts  The first district was great! I had a fantastic sm and we had a great team  I was quickly promoted from sa to assistant mng  Due to some life issues I had to move back home  The district I currently work in is terrible  The dm goes on rants and will walk in a store in his district and fire employees like it’s nothing. He also has his minions that have their head so far up his behinnd that’s their noses have turned brown  I hate this district
bad,I hated working here and didn’t work with me. Fired me for health reasons instead of working with me. I was enjoying working there at first but it was not worth it in the end.
bad,Everyone ask why there are long lines at DG. *Lack of Labor hours to provide good customer service. This makes it difficult on all crew and lowers the incentives.
bad,"The General Manager was by far the worst boss I have ever had. She is racist and doesn’t support the black community of the town. The employees are not treated fairly when it comes to pay,we are overly worked and under payed"
bad,I hated it everyone had bad attuide  manger  got mad and fire me cause i told her to be more professional and do not pay  good or give good hourshad to learn my job by watching others work
bad,It's an okay job if its your very first job. But dollar general definitely under pays you for all the hard work you do. They expect you to stock shelves and run the register and lots of other things. They need to pay a lot more.
bad,"I absolutely hated working at Dollar general, and yes, I know hate is a strong word. You get paid minimum wage, and you're worked like a work horse for that $7.25. You're expected to be at 5 places at once when you're only one person. You get one raise a year and it's a $0.25 raise at that. No room to move up in the company. 1/5 stars."
bad,Your job is not secure they use your social security number as your number to clock in while out in the open so if anyone was behind you they would easily know it
bad,Only been here a week but won’t be here too long. This is a last resort management job with a 5 and half day work week. The pay is the lowest in the industry . Under 50 for all that. Look elsewhere.
bad,"Pay sucks, enjoyed working with customers, and my DG family. Hours suck, upper management and my last manager were the worst! As a Assistant Manager for three years and getting paid only 9.25 and hour for three years it's sad. That's why I quit."
bad,Do not put your heart into this company they do not care about you they work you to hard for too little pay. And will replace you as soon as you are about to get a raise. Dollar general only cares about the dollar signs
bad,"Is it OK company to work for for just starting out on with a job they don’t pay very much minimum wage for cashier a dollar more for keyholder in about 40,000 a year for a manager but they are continuously cutting hours to the point where you cannot get anything done managers have to work at least Three or four hours by there selves a day and you barely have the time to get the truck put out but did you get your butt chewed for things not being done even though they cut your hours!"
bad,"I can not say that all Dollar General Stores operate the same way. I'm only speaking about the one I worked for in Framingham, MA. This particular store has the worst management team ever. The general manager at this store is just plain awful, from the way she treats and speaks to her employee's, and that also includes customer's and their young children. She hires under false pretense"
bad,"They would rather have robots than people. Indentured servitude was supposed to be a thing of the past, many time i would exceed 27 to 30 hour shifts...do not go into management!!!"
bad,"They can't keep employees, because they are treated horribly, pay is awful, they can't keep anything organized. Drama is a huge problem. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"This is probably the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced. Long story short, as an Assistant Manager I was asked to work of the clock, without lunches, and lie for my DM and write a false statement. I refused. I was fired, accused of buying penny products, and reported to esteem. Folks think twice before you work for this company."
bad,I was a keyholder they pooped on me daily left me too close store by myself very often I have all customers as witnesses boss also worked me wit pink eye
bad,"This place is horrible for management, you are expected to work 60+ hours a week while being compensated for only 48 being hung out to dry with massive amounts of freight and no assistance"
bad,"When I started this job as a key holding manger, I was promised 20-30 hours a week, right from the start that didn't happen. This job was also the lowest paying management position I ever had. They wanted me to do so much more work then they gave me hours to do it in. Overall not a good job and they don't care about their employees from what I have gathered"
bad,"Expectations is to give everything in your entire core.  This job is perfect for a single individual with nothing else to live for.  Work more than the minimum required 48 hours with no holidays, no weekends and no time for any family/friends events and this job is perfect for you."
bad,This company does not care about the employees.      You work bad hours and not good pay. Can't say it enough work hours off the clock no appreciation
bad,Do not like this store treated unfairly and unclean bad management no hours no help never have stuff no mangment on duty unless one as there dislike i6
bad,"Wouldn't even recommend is to a high school student. The danger in working at a place like this and seeing how people are treated, lets me know I will NEVER shop there again. They want too much for far too little - minimum wage. They want you to WORK as though you're making bank, but they treat you like an idiot. ANYONE can be a manager, and and I can see why. The turnover is ridiculous. They can't keep good help. They hire basically children who become management quickly and have little to no knowledge how to run a business. One of the 20 yr old managers SPIT on the sidewalk and smoked pot in the parking lot  I saw it and smelled it. That's what happens when you hire trash. The one I've been in has a young, tall, blond girl with a horrible personality. It is clear she doesn't like working the register. Sorry to break it to her, but the job of taking in the money is the MOST important job in the store. If someone doesn't like working at the register, they need to find another job. That goes for all of them who think they're too good to cash customers out. Which brings me to another point, if I have to stand in line ten minutes to get checked out, I can go elsewhere. The lines are ALWAYS long, and usually only one cashier busting their behind trying to get everyone taken care of. I will also be writing a letter to corporate about this issue. Anyone can shop anywhere and not put up with this."
bad,Awful company to work for in general. No communication or ethics. They will use you up and throw you out. They pay horribly and will not give raises or work with you. If they don't like you they will change your position with no backing or proof that your doing a bad job.
bad,The customers treat you like dirt and the management does nothing.They promote lazy and new people who have no idea what they are doing. I worked every holiday while others were off with their families celebrating.I also worked alone in  the store without any help on the busiest hours of the day.
bad,"The new location on Maple Valley was a great location.  The manager made statements & promises during the interview that were HOPEFUL at best.  The ""good ol boy"" mentality is something that a person not from this area can not survive in.  3 of the staff were kin to everyone in the area, or had a relations of some sort.  They grew up in the area and knew EVERYONE by first name, their history, and more.  The level of back stabbing, here say, he-said-she-said, and gender discrimination is crazy.  There is no set schedule as it wold change almost instantly.  GHOST schedules were posted and changed at the last minute.  The hours were non existent.  There were so many inconsistencies in how things were to be done, what was to be done, NO REAL TRAINING other then to FIGURE IT OUT.  customers & employees were always in personal business.  gossip, drama, finally mental health issues that forced resignations."
bad,"I have never worked for a company who doesn't appreciate there valuable employees and managers, they don't pay there people what they are worth. They should value there people a little more"
bad,"What I liked was the customers, what I didn’t like was Manager never helps, the store is late on all displays. Forget about your family. The assistant manager is hard working should be the manager never slacking. Don’t ask for a weekend day off those are the managers days off no matter what anytime of the year she will not work a night or a weekend shift."
bad,Everything is going to be ok the company is ok but you don't get paid what your worth I wouldn't tell nobody not to work there let them figure it out all on they own
bad,"This is the worst place you will ever work lazy & disrespectful management want to threaten you over BS, want you to work off the clock to save budget hours, change shiftted hours without notice, this place is a joke."
bad,They have very rude management and expect you to work for them a n d therw quick to put you on the rejectable do not hire list they cut your hours so low 10 to 15 hours a week
bad,"Gave it my ALL: 100% no employee appreciation, too much favoritism making work aggravating and disappointing. Never heard a good job or job well done. Sad place to work. Good enough to maybe pay some bills until a better job comes along."
bad,"My warning to everyone that wants to avoid struggle and stress in your life. This is a failing company, which they won’t tell you that. You’ll work a 4 day week, 12 hours a night, sometimes 5 days without them letting you know. There’s no leeway, you can’t take off for an emergency, you’ll get fired. You will work in the most depressing, hot, and very very dusty. Please, the company treats people awfuland constantly disrespects you. Did I forget that they’re extremely sexist?"
bad,Worst job I have ever had! Management never gets a break. Have to work off the clock because your the only one with keys. I would never recommend anyone working for this company!
bad,My boss expects me to be superhuman. They do not pay all that well either. I have worked there for six years and I just got promoted to Assistant Manager. I have been doing the Assistant Manger job for 4 of those six years. My job would not be so bad if everyone got good and fair pay at hours that worked for them.
bad,I thought working for dollar general was gonna be great. Turns out everybody (supervisors and managers) are out dor themselves. Its not about teamwork or the customers. I am very disappointed in what I was hired in.
bad,They expect you to do all the closing duties and help unload the truck as well so when you work nights only and very busy with customers in the evenings it's hard to get truck stuff done and general manager is always on your butt never says a good thing to you and I was a very hard worker and tried my hardest to get all duties done every night
bad,"They do not trust you to do anything yourself, I basically needed to have a manager behind me when i ran register in case something went wrong if not id have to hold up the line for a good 10 minuets as the manager came up front just to turn a key. The break room was either way to hot or way too cold, our bathrooms constantly breaking and the company doing absolutely nothing about it. We've had our power go out and the higher up say to keep the store open. Do not work here"
bad,They never wanted to pay overtime to you if you got overtime and you work by yourself and if you don’t get a break they would yell at you about it sometimes they wouldn’t find help went the nights that people are by their self
bad,"They over work you and pay you bare minimum, this company pays nothing but expects you to do everything with barely any help.  Could be better if the top actually cared about employees instead of lining his pockets."
bad,Its a horrible company to work for. Not paid nearly enough for the 5 job roles you have to play. They want you to do everything to run the store and continuously are cutting vendors adding more work for no extra pay. Its barely over minimum wage for basically a manger role. Horrible company and thats why the turnover rate is so high because they work you to death for very little pay.
bad,Started out as simple cashier. Got a call from another Dollar General asking for help and offered to promote me to a full time lead sales associate/key holder. I agreed to transfer just long enough to help and never got transferred back to my home store as it was agreed upon so pretty messed up situation. Even after sickness in family matters and the so called I'll work with flexibility hours and I could only work in the mornings and only a few days due to these issues I agreed to knock me down to part Time and they refused and I was terminated for calling in and not being able to show for the inconvenient schedule that was made up
bad,"Low pay, no hours, no advancement, awful managers, Dont waste the time unless you cant find another job. Hired me with the understanding I would be an assistant manager in 6 months. they gave me all the responsibilities, the keys, and then when it was time for my promotion, they hired someone from outside the company with NO experience and told me to train the guy to do the job I was promised (paying him almost 2 times what they were paying me, I might add)."
bad,"The work invironmen was really toxic, my manager was quite rude and would often takr it out on whoever was at work that day, I was physically assaulted by costumers on two separate occasions and my manager didnt call the police or even ask them to leave the store."
bad,"Their Store Managers are overworked and under paid. I had to work 108+ hours a week to keep up with the demands of the store, due to their hourly employees hours being cut."
bad,"Often only 2 employees at one time with stocking, inventory, cleaning and customer service required.  The location was easy to reach and there were plenty of hours available to work."
bad,Company is not understanding to personal reasons or family emergencies. The pay is not enough after I demoted myself they dropped my pay from 10 to 9.50 with no notice. They are not flexible with availability and the corporate office does not respond to claims.
bad,This job is garbage don't waste your time. I got hurt on the job. The workers comp lady is horrible at her job and extremely rude. The managers are not managers... Rude and distrespectful
bad,"Working at dollar general was the single worst experience of my entire life. The level of work I had to do was beyond my pay grade, and in such unsafe work conditions. Dollar general does not care for the employees, only their own profits"
bad,"Unfair hours, expectations are to be very low if you plan on working here. Plan on working ridiculous hours. They expect so much of you with very little time to do it."
bad,Dollar general is the worst company to work for. They do not care about their employees.  They take it out on you of you will not work off the clock. They do not appreciate the good workers
bad,When the old manager retired I got a new manager I was 4 and 1/2 months pregnant she tried to make me move the rolltainers from one end all the way to the other side. So one day she made me pick between getting my child back and my job. I did what any other mother would do and chose my child.
bad,Worked there for 2 months it was a terrible experience.Manger was rude and didn’t know how to talk to employees .I hates every moment at that job they expect so much out of part time employees that only get 10 hours a week.just quit and glad to be gone
bad,Billion dollar company wants you to live in their store and work like you get paid good but doesn’t want to pay their employees but as little as they can get by with. Want miracles to happen but gives the stores low amount of payroll to work with. It’s ALL about the $$$$
bad,good day working there ok people to work with . I hated working their. aweful work environment.   the coworkers were helpful and always there when you needed help
bad,No family time...always under staffed . not a safe place to work.. needs a better senior management structure.. better hours to be open... over worked most of the time.
bad,the manager i worked for was unfair and rude i had been working there for about five months busting my back and was refused for a raise but after someone was hired my manager had  given them a raise and a promotion.
bad,The company used to be good to work for I worked hard and worked my way up but it's different now on how they treat thier workers and just use ur better judgement
bad,Manager was not fair to all employees and the pay was not good at all. And there was no way of climbing up for advancement. Better pay and actually being appreciated for your work is almost a never.
bad,"My manager would make a point to tell everyone , everyone elses life stories. To customers to other employees. Never had the help or support to accomplish things in a timely or organized manner. Just all around the very worst place i have ever worked. So glad to be out of there."
bad,The company is horrible ! They lied and they have people in cooperate lie for them. I had someone spit in my face and the manager over mine laugh come to find out the same man that laugh is now in jail for trying to mołest a little boy!
bad,"They work you like a horse, dont care if your sick or have a fsmiky emergency, force you to work 16hr shifts alone, their leadership is poor when it comes to regional manager's"
bad,"Dollar General is one of the worst companies to work for! In the individual stores it isnt too bad of you have the privilege of getting on with a good team, but the corporate rules, guidelines, and policies will drive you literally insane! They pay minimum wage expect you to work miracles with small staffs, barely any hours to share amongst all employees except the store manager so basically that means the more help you have the less hours anyone gets. You get some training by way of computer learning modules that dont really clearly explain any of the topics but vaugley cover what you need to know and leave out tons of things they should include. The district managers never help with anything relevant they only come in to complain and tell you what youre doing wrong,never what a good job youve done or compliment. The save audit people do the same. They tell you be aggresive with shop lifters but  coporate policy doesnt allow you to do anything aboit shoplifters. They expect employees to do the work of 10 people with only 1 or 2band ghand out write ups when that isnt accomplished. The systems never work correctly nor are they in anyway up to date with the times. If you have to call their technocal department you might as well plan on spending half your shift on the phone to redo anything and everything youve already done anyway. They take forever to do a background check most generally 4+ weeks and then they end up having such a high turnover rate that stores never have enough people to keep up and generally run singal coverage shifts at least half of the buisness hiurs out"
bad,"This is the worst company I ever work for in all my life never work for them again. They don’t pay good they change mangers like change clothing,you don’t get a lots of hours even if you full time ,the mangers wii steal an blame you for it and they work you like a dog ."
bad,DMs and SMs work 80 hours a week and turnover is ridiculously high at all positions.  They turn and burn everyone.  Not a sustainable future for the company.  Encountered bigotry and racism from ignorant uneducated middle management.  Labor laws are ignored.  Pricing is inaccurate and a disaster.  Stores are shipped more product on one truck then they can fit in many of their tiny receiving room.
bad,Fired 2 days before my return from FMLA... Manager actually said to me; I have a cousin with the same illness and they are fine everyday. Personal verbal attacks from upper Mangement
bad,My manager treated me like actual garbage. He only scheduled me one day a week. Stock day. We would restock the entire store and if we didn't run through the isles with dog food over our heads we weren't going hard enough. The only time I received approval was when I passed out from exhaustion.
bad,The Dollar General I worked at was simply horrible! The manager tried to throw me under the bus when she got in trouble. When I got pregnant with my child they gave me their own restrictions although I provided a letter from my doctor stating I had no work restrictions. The acting store manager could never get to work on time. I would have to work from open to close most days and my pay didn't reflect that at all! Just don't work for Dollar General!
bad,"Pay is decent but no help within the company when you have call outs or if you get sick, they pay associates minimum wage so it’s hard to find quality associates"
bad,After I started they changed Management so I didn't get the recognition that I expected.The Manager that hired me offered me a position as a key holder/manager and started me on training. When she left she told the new manager about the job offering she promised me. The new manager didn't follow through with the offering so I got upset and quit. I now regret doing that but I just didn't feel good enough at that point.
bad,"No matter how hard you work, favoritism will always be there! All the supervisors try to get with the girls, it's disgusting, and the worst part is they fire anyone who gets close to the pay out. Horrible!"
bad,I worked at DG for 12 1/2 years and in the end realized they DON'T CARE how hard you work or how many years you had perfect attendance. Upper management engages in questionable behavior...but let someone a little less liked do the same thing and they get terminated. FAVORITISM!!!!! Sadly not a good place to work. Very back-stabbing environment.
bad,"They only pay you as a general manager 45hours a week and expect you to work 60 hours a week they want your to work 6 days a week. And you have to do 2 opens  2closes and 3 mids shifts all holidays  and every Saturday. The work load and expatriation are enough to make someone insane.  You have a high turn over of employees.  So you will be stuck working all the time."
bad,"Working there back in 2017-2018 was terrible, honestly glad I quit. The place was always a mess, the manager never did anything but, sit in the office and eat all day. "
bad,There really isn't a lot to say accept the manager wouldn't train me right and then asked me night shift needed I told her she cut my hours and for $8 hr it was NOT worth all that.
bad,I really hate working at Dollar general. This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had. the employees there are not friendly not or they trust worthy.
bad,"I’ve worked in retail and customer service since I have started working, and this is one of the WORST places I have worked. It’s probably just because of the location and mostly the manager and assistant manager. Everyone is constantly in a horrible mood, customers were almost always rude, no matter how hard you work it’s not good enough, and your availability does not matter because they will schedule you what what ever they want."
bad,I worked for a manager that only cared for herself and did not care about you or anyone else she did not allow me to transfer out of her store. there fore i am no longer working there.
bad,"They suck, payroll sucks, there always one person in the store there's never payroll for customer service, tricks are big because warehouse sends out to much and the store is always trash"
bad,"First day, dragged to different store, and put on a register with ZERO training. Was promised full time work, got 15 hrs/week. Made inquiries and complaints, and all of them ignored."
bad,"Terrible boss, she made the work so much harder, had a terrible attitude, tho everyone else who worked with me and still work with me are great and amazing people, she just makes the work environment toxic, and the job is super easy."
bad,"Hated working here, manager was terrible before a new one replaced her, got in trouble for no reason, expected way to much work to get done in only 1 hour. Called in for work on days off to much."
bad,"Lack or training, horrible inexperienced lazy managers, a pathetic district manger, and a joke of a corporate officials.  Overall dollar general is horrible. I have yet to find one store that has a decent all of the above I mentioned. Only good thing about my experience is that I met a handful of great people and it was convenient to where I live."
bad,"My coworkers were AMAZING!!! But the manager had her favorites and made it clear. Happy to be away from there. Was almost impossible to be seen as a good employee by the manager, very poor management!"
bad,I have never been treated with such disrespect/ garbage. The store manager was so horrible nearly all of the staff quit. I warned everyone I could to never apply/work there.
bad,Great place to work. Know most of the customers. Get along with all of my co-workers. Glad I was able to get a job in such a comfortable environment..
bad,It was a good company to work for I loved  working for the company but bad management and co-workers. Some stores are good to work for because they have good management and workers but not the one I worked for. The big people really need to go to their stores more and observe how their so called management and employers work. I would loved to stayed but switch stores but I got played  around with my money to much my money every week didn’t add up right for the hours I worked.
bad,"They don't pay the cashiers nothing but minimum wage for all the stocking, lifting,  bending, and standing they do. They don't talk to you like you are a grown woman or man. The benefits or horrible. You don't get hours. I was a key holder part time. They don't make much either. $9.00 dollars an hour to do everything that a cashier does. Plus open and close the store. And do pulls, paper work, sign for vendors, and reports at the beginning and end of the shift. Etc."
bad,"They,dont care about there,employees,or,customers,just about there,money.tebh,don't,give over,time,you work,all,day and,never,have,time,for,yourself, the,training,is,bad,they,don't,even,train,you just throw,you,under the,bus,to,figure,out,things,on,your,own"
bad,"at dollar general nobody really cares about the store. people just go to punch the clock mostly. also when they say they have ""flexible scheduling"" they mean u have that day off if u don't have an open availability for that day"
bad,I was hired on in October of 2017 for seasonal par time work. After I was there for about a month money started coming up missing from the safe and the registers. Our manager was blaming all of us the employees of not being careful when giving change back to the customer. That made no sense to me. Then larger amounts of money was coming up missing. Everyone was getting blamed except for management which was unfair. I got tired of all of it so after the holidays I ended up quitting my job before they let me go.
bad,It was not a safe work environment  I had a horrible 2yrs been assaulted by customers not having security working in a high crime area and was not protected at all
bad,Could be an awesome place to work but its only about the dollars.  There is no incentive to advance.  Its all about making money for the upper management.
bad,"Turnover is HUGE-No work life balance-The Regional Manager I interviewed with was terminated before I started.  His replacement made it less than a year and most of my peers terminated also.  Store managers are expected to run the store with no payroll.  If the truck is not complete by T2(two days after truck), they are expected to stay all night to throw freight until it is done.  We had numerous armed robberies and actually taught our people how to get out of being tied up.  Unbelievable."
bad,"The job was easy and the customers are the best part. The favoritism, gossip and rumors that go on within the company is sickening. There is no true open door policy. The pay is awful."
bad,I hated working there I got robbed at gunpoint working there and it took the police a long time to get there I had to go to therapy to get over this horrible ordeal
bad,Very rude dnt care about family or personal life.  My daughter was in a car accident and they woukdnt let me leave. If your sick u cant call off. They really do not care about u as a person.
bad,"Did not like this job. The pay is horrible. The amount of work expected out of one person in a shifts time is ridiculous. One employee is expected to check out customers, do office/paperwork, stock, put out sales stickers, zone and clean store. Worst job I ever had"
bad,There isn't enough space for me to explain why this is the most unfair and prejudice company I've ever worked for. The managers stole and had employees fib for them. Let other employees threaten to do harm to others with no actions. I could go on for hours.
bad,They are very unfair when it comes to being up front with there employees If your position is be done away with they will not let you know until it is to leave to do anything about. And that isn't fair to the employee so that they can looking for something else with in the company or outside of the company.
bad,The store manager treats people unfairly and is friends with female employees and if you are a male you are terrible human and no one likes you and they never let you know or schedule changes
bad,The only thing wrong with the dollar general I worked at was the manager that they left  when the actual store manager went on maternity leave I have been at that store for 4 years and never had any problems but ever since they put the new manager every thing became a constant headache
bad,I worked there for almost 2.5 years and I was a MOD and would often work off the clock or be left by myself for hours at a time. Manager was nowhere to be found when something went wrong or I needed help and corporate does nothing about the poor management. They just get rid of the food people
bad,"Manager is never there but on the schedule is marked for 45+hours. On the off day she is, she’s outside smoking something. Blames her store being messed up ALL on employees. When in reality it’s a representation of you. Her example is what we have leaving us when we have a 8 or more people in line waiting to be checked out she walks out everyone knowing she just gave a list of things to be done and left her mess for us to clean up along with get 5 rolltainers put away."
bad,"From day 1 you are treated like a number. Every single employee is considered ""general warehouse."" There is a meeting daily about 30 minutes after you begin working and the managers determine the employees to be ""farmed out"" to other departments. Every manager will discriminate based on age, sex, physical stature and personal preference. The harder you work the harder supervisors will require you to work. The attendance policy is brutal. 2 days missed in your first 90 days and/or 4 tardy arrivals in a rolling 60 day time period and your are terminated. The hours vary on a DAILY basis and you may be required to come in early, stay late or even work an extra day with very little notice. They also will require you to work through your breaks if the building is going to get out early. No job security. Production standards are extremely hard to the point employees cheat the system just to keep their jobs. Insurance is outrageous! If you work nights, your work week starts on a Sunday!"
bad,Wouldn't go back even if i get paid 20 a hour. I did like how they treated me. they didnt like it when you didn't work on your day off. they would only give you 15 hours a whole week just for not working on my day off.
bad,"The hours given are only good for those who are still in school, management doesn't understand that one cannot get a vehicle, let alone live on, the salary given"
bad,Management is very uncaring about job. Place is a mess always. Crowded. It’s hard to ask anyone for help because there isn’t no one around. Always have to find someone to check you out.
bad,This is a great place to work not if you need money to pay bills. The store I worked at and a few surrounding has a huge presentation of immaturity within management and workers who been with the company for a while
bad,"Since I have worked as a full time lead here, i have decided that i will never again work for this company. They expect insane amounts of productivity and flexibility for negligible compensation. My manager attempted to institute a pay secrecy policy, and threatened my job if I discussed my hourly rate with any other employees, completely ignoring a federally protected right m"
bad,Come in clock in see what I have to do work it’s always someone yelling about some I learned to just let people talk so I can get my hours and get paid management didn’t care hardest part was talking to others most enjoyable part was leaving
bad,I’m not sure how someone can be approved to allow a employee to work 4 hours a week but I feel like that should be illegal!!! Management is a joke. I would skip this place no joke.
bad,"Prefer to keep negative reviews to myself.  Will not recommend this job to any friend or family only given 8 hrs a week , quit and will never go back . Ok , since the site is forcing me to type more .  No room for advancement or pay raise . It's a deadbeat , dead end , low pay , low hours job"
bad,"The manager has a very bad attitude, and even you sick she still want you to come to work, she don't take doctor excuses and she will get mad if you do and threatened to fire you."
bad,The managers would sit in the office watching YouTube while they left the smaller workers to do everything. They were always making dirty jokes and comments about customers
bad,If you can handle getting yelled at all the time and not feeling like your good enough this is a job for you they always hired outside employees instead of moving you up in the company I was passed up 4 times for a full time assistant manager position I finally quit.
bad,"The hours are all over the place, as well as the shift schedules. There is no way to guess an average weekly income will be, or make a living off of this job."
bad,"It's an okay job if you need to put gas in your car or get some to eat but it's not gone help pay any bills. they don't wanna give you no overtime, or give you hours. they give people hours they want to have them."
bad,Horrible company to work for understaffed manger wood leave an not come back. As a employee this company i would be left inside store by myself a lot was scared for my safety
bad,They do not care about you. I worked at the one in Pearl River and they are unorganized and will work you like a dog. You will be taken advantage of. They hire people to have enough bodies in the store if you're lucky and you have to pick up the slack of the other people who don't do anything.
bad,"If you have no family or don't mind not seeing them often. Also love dealing with disrespectful customers for following policy. Being verbally assaulted with no support from your superiors. Also enjoy people constantly stealing. As well as terrible pay for the amount of work required, then dollar general is the job for you!"
bad,No communication between top management and closing management mother's working with daughters husbands working with wives Etc not an ideal working environment if you have kids my hours got cut and dropped due to a mother-daughter Team all my hours went to her daughter which is very unfair favoritism over somebody who really deserved it...
bad,The worst GM if his mood changed so did ur pay rate. I had to go on anxiety and antidepressants to deal with this man after 6 months working with that monster.
bad,No good for nothing RASIST. Manager will hire some more associates and cut your hours. If you are cashier you will be doing lot more other jobs something you never expected.
bad,"Poor managment, manager very fake will smile in your face just to fire you. Racist, and does not give warnings for mistakes like I'm not human or something, terrible place to work never again."
bad,"Highly stressful, lack of help with leadership, no appreciation for all the work. No respect for workers, work days on end without a day off, lack of trainning"
bad,Nothing good about this company at all. 2 faced backstabbers that work you to death. God forbid you child get sick. You will hear all about it from your boss.
bad,This is just a really bad corporation in general management is bad and if you do have a good manager you better hope they stay because dollar general was the worst store I ever worked at the employees were rude
bad,"Store is a disaster. Newburghs best cashier left because of the lack management from the district manager missy to the store manager. The store hasn’t been the same since the manager has taken over. The manager tells everyone’s business (associates), including hers to the customers while ringing them up."
bad,"Horrible work environment. Only guaranteed 4 hours a week for part time, poor management, including from district managers, no real training on procedures."
bad,"Heather the store manger at creve coeur is very unfair, if she dont like she will find ways too fire you,  break confidential,  talks about other employees behind their. Letting others use someone else drawer. Writing someone up for something y ou didn't do. Letting customers to steal from the store without doing anything.  Threatening employees their jobs if you dont sign a write up when you didn't do anything M"
bad,"Corporate does not give you enough payroll to properly run the store!!!"
bad,its a temporary job you can and will be replaced and u will work long hours and holidays no room for screw up will write you up for any little thing .
bad,Did not enjoy working here. The manager never did his job and he would go hide. The employees didn't really get the help they needed because of the poor manager choice.
bad,I worked for the one in eastmoline on the Avenue of the cities and the manager carrie was the worst person to work for she was racist and she lowered my pay with out telling me or having a reason to and she worked me hours and didn’t put them on my check so don’t work at that dollar general
bad,Never will I work for them  again treated me like a dog took me off the schedule and was a coward fake phony and told me lies and didn’t train me through me to them wolves
bad,"Don't work here."
bad,Hated this job they offered absolutely no benefits for their employees! The pay was not good! Management was poor! I was called in all the time to work on my days off because the MANAGER couldn’t make it in!
bad,"Very low pay, even by retail standards. They expect one employee to run the entire store at times, and often reprimand you for not working ""harder"". Management doesn't care about you what so ever, and key holders aren't allowed to leave when CLOCKED OUT, for lunch. Was a terrible experience, and I'll never work or shop  at this company again."
bad,I wouldn't work at this place at all. Doesn't recognize veterans. The place is a mess. It should be shut down because it is a safety hazard. Not enough help to do the job.
bad,They use untrained people to open brand new stores and tell them they are to blame that the store won't open on time. They tell them they are too slow but aren't stocking perfect enough all in the same breath. We were told we were supposed to unload a rolltainer an hour per person. We were setting up a brand new store and had no clue exactly where everything went.
bad,They overwork their store managers I saw 7 store managers quit because of the open to close they had to work with no days off. I was overwhelmed and overworked with no help.
bad,"As a former employee, I will never tell anyone to work for dollar general. The reasons being that the former manager I had took my travel pay and the former district manager would throw our food in the garage"
bad,"The stores are too small for the trucks, severally understaffed, and the management is not screened for their positions. There is no communication between anyone in the company and the workers are severely overworked."
bad,"This company is very repulsive, They will never do anything for their employee(s) except for making you feel like a criminal. They OVER work you with minimal pay, expect you to be on call and when you decline to cover someone's shift they make you feel terrible for doing so. As an ASM after 3 years, They told me Full Time was ONLY 28 hours per Dollar General Standards. They make you work alone, and they don't understand the meaning of a day off. Do yourself a favor, and find something else."
bad,"I went to my manager instead of going to the labor board to get paid for having to clock out for lunch but not being able to leave,  and they paid all the leads that it happened to from the day they opened. On the day they gave me my back pay for that issue they fired me."
bad,"Stores are always disorganized and dirty because there are never enough employees to perform all the functions required to keep the stores stocked, prganized, and clean."
bad,"Always short staffed, and the manager didn't know how to do their own job. The sales associates and assistant manager had to do all the managers work. "
bad,Very bad company to work for they lied all the time and play to many games upper management is a joke they don't help they are not around long enough to do any good for the company
bad,You could have the best work experience in the world but if you have any type of record you automatically become nothing and they will fire you. They hire you first then will fire you before your first day even though they already hired you.
bad,"I was lied to every step of the way, no training at all.. under paid for the position that was agreed upon and it took over 3 months to get job..stay away from this employer"
bad,My Boss Was Evil. He Didn’t Pay Me For All My Hours I Worked. And He Didnt Give Me Any Days. Just 2 Or 3 A Week. I Won’t Go Back Ever Ever I Just Do The Disrespects.
bad,Worked the job of 10 people. No consideration for person life or family. No compassion for being truly sick. Not a company that you want to work for. Cheap and don’t pay the employees right. Breaks are not real. Make you take an hour long break you clock out for and then hand you a phone and say stay close to the front door on your break Incase we need you at the register or with a customer. Then don’t pay you for it. They make you stay there on unpaid breaks and basically the cheapest and most selfish and ridiculous company I have ever worked for.
bad,"It is a bad work environment, no personal time and no family time , and the is not very good for the amount of hours you have to work, you work by yourself most of the time"
bad,bad company to work for start out at $7.25 I worked there for 7 years and was only making $10.75 when I quit too much expected with no payroll and very little help
bad,Horrible work environment. Highly recommend that you NOT work here. Horrible training team. Rude employees and non professional management. Boss stands around and does nothing but talk about you while you're working. Manager no doubt pick favorites
bad,Never work their they will cut ure hours write u up for stupid reason nobody is prefect everyone messes up in life the back room is destroyed cant even get to the mop station been using same water for a week have ugly people being mean to the customer especially the Store Manager
bad,They shorten your hours when you do a good job and when you are a lead key holder just so part time employee can get 40 or more hours I wouldn't recommend nobody to work there cause they show favoritism
bad,Dollar general does not appreciate nor value their employees. Extraordinary work requirements coupled with low pay.Dollar general does not place value in their managers or management staff. Constantly understaffed and overworked.
bad,"This business expects managers to work open to close and to complete stocking, cashiering, cleaning, watching cameras, customer assistance, ordering, layouts, shelf pulls, and everything else needing done all while working totally alone in a store that was the size of walmart cut in half.  Literally i was in an old walmart building"
bad,Dollar general is a great place to save money amd find almost all of your personal needs when shopping but as an employee getting the states minimum pay per hour its hard to stay motivated when u get paid next to nothing
bad,Awful job!!! Awful pay. And they will not work with you on hours at all. Area managers are total slave drivers. Not really the managers fault. They are trying to make a living.
bad,Worstvplace ever. They truly don't care about you.. DONT WORK FOR THIS PLACE. This is not a family friendly environment. They will lie and yell you anything to keep you working.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for with the absolutely least professional staffing at every single level of the company I was exposed to. From the delivery drivers all the way up to the district and regional managers. The entire operation, from top to bottom, is f-bombing clown shoes. Unless you're going hungry or homeless you are better off elsewhere."
bad,"I got fired because I was carrying my gun to work... i have a license to carry from the state of Texas,  but Dollar General  overrides that... I only started to bring it to work after another manager was robbed and killed while at work.  (I have no regrets and continue to stand by my decision)"
bad,"Think twice about working for this company, if you're looking for something in the meantime, I won't know you for it. But as a career it's no worth your time and or patience you'll be there stuck in the same job and salary with broken promises. Just like Management and the high ups that they have they're Tweedledees and Tweedledums. Work until you're fingers fall off and be prepared to hear what you didn't do and never what you've done. God forbid you're sick or get an illness DO NOT CARE you must come to work. Overall don't work at this location or dam near any others favoritism and unfairness runs deep. You've been warned."
bad,This by far is the worse job you can ever work. I hate it so much. The turn over is horrible. The pay is weekly but it is bare minimum. It’s a smothering position where you feel trapped. It is absolutely one of the worse companies to work for. They do not care about their employees. Upper management doesn’t answer the phone when you need them. General managers are often rookies who don’t know much. You are forced to work doubles of the next shift doesn’t show.
bad,"Too short staffed"
bad,"the most employees on staff may be 4 for unloading a truck load once a week. For the rest of the week, there's only 2 to keep up with the whole store, stock the shelves, ring up customers at the register, watch for theft, clean the store and ""provide optimal customer service."" This is often not a cheery place to shop or work. Don't get hurt on the job. Doctors that are paid by the company through workman's comp, deny every injury they can get away with."
bad,"Couldn't possibly put into words how awful this company treats it's employees."
bad,"I loved my job.  I left because management was unfair and biased.  If your the managers GOOD friend you get the hours you want and days off you want.  My ""raise"" after a year as assistant manager was a whole .30 cents per hour, it was insulting after all the hard work we did to turn this store around.  Upper management won't talk to you they snub you.  I was made fun of by my manager and put down on a regular basis by other employees.  THIS COMPANY DOESN""T CAre ABOUT IT'S EMPLOYEES WHAT SO EVER."
bad,It sucks. Bad store managers bad gm and dm. Lack of respect. If you complain to Corp. Nothing gets done but your store mngr will find out and threaten your job
bad,Barely gives you any hours and the pay is horrible. Has horrible management and they basically make you do everything in the store while they stand there and talk and go outside 20 different times to smoke or just talk. It's not worth it.
bad,"only positive thing about working for dollar general is the weekly paycheck, if they get your hours correct....."
bad,Horrible experience. No payroll hours to staff store. Low pay. Benefits were not good. The district manager did not support me. The store was always a mess because you had 4 employees covering the whole store for the whole week.
bad,"Dollar General is a terrible place to work, with no regard for high performing employees.  After several months of being recognized for high performance and promised full-time employment, the hiring manager proceeded to post the position without being transparent about their hiring plans.  The hiring manager did not inform us about this decision and proceeded to hire their family member.  Additionally, we were not given notice and were disrespectfully dismissed within a few several hours.  I have not experienced such disrespectful and unfair behavior."
bad,"I was only one who worked 7 days a week. I couldn't take my vacation. Manager and assistant took theirs . I was under paid. I also averaged 8 to 9 hours a day ,everyone else 5 to 6 . Was ordered to do 2 rolltainers a day plus b a manager."
bad,Management was poor and very unorganized and just all around stressful. Couldn't work with you on schedule and cut my hours like crazy. Just do not reccomend at all
bad,DO NOT recommend working at DG to anyone! Work you short staffed but expect you to stock shelves clean checkout customers all by yourself while tending to  vendors.
bad,"I stood up for my imployee when DM wanted me to write them up. After that he started finding ways to push me out."
bad,I would NEVER RECOMEND dollar general to anybody. all they want to do is screw you over as much as possible and they dont care how you feel or anything like that.
bad,You don’t get the support you need as a manager. You work yourself to death. No personal life. Turn over rate horrible. Work hard for little pay. Managers work way more hours then pay.
bad,"I have been an Assistant Manager the last 2.5 years and have not been given any opportunities to move up. Pay is barely above minimum wage & I was still expected to go above and beyond my job description to help out the Store Manager, and I did without complaining. I took care of all the day-to-day while the Store Manager took all the credit and bad mouthed me to the District Manager behind my back. She did not want me to be pulled out of her store because she needed someone to pick up her slack"
bad,Do not work here. The management is terrible and you wont even be able to make enough money to pay your bills. Overall it is a waste of time. Stay away.
bad,"I was hired at one store but had to travel to different ones to cover people that did not show up.the management is not very good, and they reap all the rewards."
bad,"Management Is Poorly , They Do Not Pay Holidays . Management Treat You poorly , Makes The Schedule That Works For Them  . Store Managers And District Manger Called The Employees Monkeys ."
bad,Staff doesn't get along well. Manager talked very poorly infront of customers. Dirty store. Cockroaches everywhere. Very hostile work environment. Not a good place to work
bad,"My manager never properly trained me, not a very good work environment, very clustered, my fellow co workers was against me because I am a male in a dominantly female work place."
bad,"A typical day includes a busy workday. If you are a cashier you're on the register for the entire time you work with a 30-minute break. It's continuous long days on your feet and a lot of frustration with customer attitudes. When you do not have customers to ring up, you are expected to ""recover"" the store, but don't get caught not being available when a customer shows up at the counter and your not there at the exact moment that they want you to ring their items up and go! No, they will reak havoc on the cashier for this, but the cashier is expected to ""keep busy"" by ""recovering the store"", meaning pulling down items off of the top shelf and restocking the shelves. The cashier is also expected to keep the store clean around them and pick up after customers that leave disasters in the isles and shelves. Restocking the impulse candy in front of the registers is a must for the cashier as well. They are also expected to keep the bathrooms clean each day they work.  Customers don't treat you very well and are extremely rude. Prices on items are not updated in the system and lead to irate customers and the cashier trying to fix the price on the item. In order to call for management to help you, you have to ""page"" the ""keyholder"" on duty by hitting the locate button on the portable phone that they carry with them (if they carry it with them). This causes customers to get angry because they are waiting for the ""keyholder"" to come to the front of the store to adjust the price or see what is going on and how to correct the problem. If you are a keyholder, your availability has to be"
bad,"My manager was the worst, the store wasn’t clean, there was so much stock in the back from months before I got hired. (Stuff from May and June was still back there and I got hired in October.)"
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. They manipulated me and took advantage of my kind nature. They only inforce rules when its beneficial to them. They have one of the worst cultural I have ever seen.
bad,"I was always stressed working here and also over worked, always short staffed, always afraid for my safety when working nights with just me and 1 other employee and I was never able to please my manager or supervisor. The store was always junky and overstocked on items we did not need and the warehouse was always over filled."
bad,"(Guntown, Ms Location)"
bad,I worked for this company for almost 2 years as an assistant mgr. They only start you at $11 a hour and want you to run the register and put stock up all in a 8 hour shift. I wa shored as full time with only 31 hours a week. Many days I worked from open to close by myself with no help because of employees calling out. I've ran the store as a manager without the manager pay and not one time did I get a thank you. This has to be the worst company i have ever worked for and i finally quit and went somewhere i was appreciated and valued.
bad,This company is ok I enjoy work why I was there the coutumer  was great it's a good working place the store is nice the manger  are helpful  and and nice
bad,Yes you have employees but the lack of hours and dimensions given for how many people you can have suck. Pretty much always there to make sure freight is done. No help. No one wanted to learn new things and to even delicate anything was like pulling teeth.
bad,"Salary 60-80 hours a week "
bad,"I worked with this company a little over a month in Cadiz, Kentucky. The mangers were constantly rude to other employees and even customers. I am 5 months pregnant and have been having a lot of issues. The GM fired me on a doctors note from my OBGYN. My doctor wanted to wait until my blood work came back to figure out why I get extremely dizzy to the point I almost pass out. So moral of this all if you don't satisfy the management then you wont last long."
bad,"I paid for health insurance but never got it. Never got paid for an overnight i had worked, and then right after was made open the store 3 hrs after I had barely gotten home from work. Store manager would tell customers she knew personally and other store employees that she didn’t have to cleanup her messes at work because she had people to do it for her.. now she has me as unhireable because I didn’t want to work with her anymore and they kept my money for the extra hrs I did.."
bad,Just Dont. If you want to work for a place that expects you to do the work of 6 people and barely get paid minimum wage...then this place is for you. If you like drama among management. Go for it.  If you want to have a job where you are valued as an employee. Please dont go to a DG.
bad,Save yourself the headache and dont bother working there. If you're a good employee they will wss work you into the ground and gaslight you if you try to stand up for yourself. Management is petty and childish. It's all about cliques here. The customers are ratchet and will curse you out almost daily. DO NOT WORK HERE!
bad,I really wish I had gotten a transfer when I realized who and what my DM was. Everyday I felt stress and no job security once I agreed and took the job.
bad,"They do not pay enough and you work hard. They key holders are the ones who have the most to do, they have to do the truck go backs, stock the items, do displays, clean the store, open the store. It's a lot for the little pay."
bad,"Lack of professionalism, "
bad,I would never recommend working there ...management was horrible and rude. Other employees get annoyed easily when asked questions. Rude to customers. Don't let you complete anything
bad,The location I’m at would be a lot better if we had a better manager. Since opening the store manager has hardly been there. And is not rotating shifts like they are supposed to. The store has been open less than a year and the whole time I have been stuck on closing shifts. The only time I get to spend with my family is when everyone is asleep. Honestly not sure how much more of this I can take.
bad,I will never work for dollar general again I did not have a good experience I had to go the the emergency room and my boss called and yelled at me for calling in
bad,"I hated my job at dollar general, it was terrible, the management was terrible, no hours given to me at all. I do not recommend anyone to work there, unless you enjoy getting like $95 dollar checks a week."
bad,"I was paid the bare minimum for each advancement I got. I worked too hard for the pay I received. The manager never recognized good job performance only what you didnt do right. She allowed other store managers to come in and talk down to employees because they are ""best friends"" and when the district manager was confronted about it nothing was ever done."
bad,"I am currently a manager in Hamilton, NJ.  The staff is horrible, no matter how or who I hire and fire.  They call  out all the time, there must be something in the water that let's people think this is normal.  If people call out, the DM expects you to just stay and work a double.  I medically am not supposed to, but they don't care about that or my health.  The store has holes in the floors they refuse to fix despite them being a safety issue.  The entire store is a health code and fire code violation despite my cleaning and trying to get them to come fix everything.  It is mandatory to work 6 days a week, and I get no vacation time until 6 months in which I will only get 20 hours.  After a year I will get 40.  Maternity and FMLA is horrible here, you have to be there a year to be covered to get  paid leave and they refuse to answer any questions you have.  They cut hours so that it might just be one employee working but want you to clean, set aisles for seasonal, and work truck all while also being on register and helping customers.  I hate Dollar General.  Don't work here if you have a half a brain.  They need to be sued and shut down."
bad,"This is the second store I have worked for, but my last. My shift changed without notice and I was regularly required to work doubles. I was the only employee without a second job so I was constantly moved to appease the other employees. I received almost no breaks in over a month even on my double shifts. When I complained I had my hours cut significantly. When I tried to transfer my manager told the other store manager not to hire me. And when I protested that I was told I “can not expect breaks at a low volume store” and told to “pick my struggle”."
bad,"They work you like a dog for $8.50, get threatened if you dont complete the huge task list given. I got hit by the general manager, screamed at by a key holder and degraded by the area. I was a hard worker and taken advantageof because i take pride in my job."
bad,"Job itself is physically demanding, fast paced, and very enjoyable. However, current manager is the worst ever. Dishonest, inconsistent, untrustworthy. She is rude to customers as well as staff. Preaches teamwork, but does not promote such."
bad,Just horrible in general. Dont do it. Fire you for reasons they say you did but refuse to show proof you did it. I've seen multiple people fired before it happened to me for reasons that you never did.
bad,If I had the chance I would go back and never put an application in for this company. Wait I take that back I would just work at a different location. Because everyone there except for one manager was very rude snobby and very two faced. It was just like being in high school all over again. And honestly I have better things to do then talk about this one and that one I was just wanting to go to work and go home but there was way to much bull mess for me .  So if you like to play games or get caught up in a bunch of gossip the that’s the place to go to work
bad,TO MUCH DRAMA and very poor management you try to talk to uper management and nothing still gets done and everyone is always at each others throats so sad loved my customers though
bad,"Turnover rate is so high because workers aren't paid enough, are expected to work a daily changing schedule, and there's never enough staff due to lack of hours dictated from corporate. It's impossible to do everything necessary, put away a semi truck load in three days, set planograms, change prices, check in vendors, serve customers, etc. when often working alone."
bad,"There is no work-life balance you are never given enough resources to accomplish your job endless hours of work with no appreciation "
bad,They treat their employees like your not a person. have to kiss up to the manager 2 get hours. They're being sued for not paying overtime to employees. Also they are supremely disorganized and allow discrimination.
bad,"Poor management, terrible working conditions. They will change the schedule on you the same day you're working, and will label you as no call no show if they changed it without letting you know or on your day off. never work there"
bad,They don't have any organization skills we got robbed 4 times in a month. They don't clean anywhere it's disgusting and smells terrible all the time the worst Job I have ever had.
bad,"Terrible management,  horrible work hours and work load."
bad,The manager at the Keller location purposely didn’t give me hours to work so I had to leave. She would give her favorites the hours. No communication given ever!! I was promised that I wouldn’t have to close all the time but that’s what happened.
bad,"Dollar general was an awful place to work for. Place wasn’t fair to work for. Hours were enough, not enough pay. I was only supposed to work morning shifts and they always had me working nights."
bad,"I was hired as a cashier. Was fired within a month due to my manager directing the assistant manager to shorten my till twice"
bad,They don't give you enough hours and then when you get in the job or something else in your life stay yell at you for not be able to work when they need you to after you go on with not much hours already
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. For anyone looking for a job this isnt the right job. It doesn’t pay enough. And it definitely doesn’t pay enough if you have children and a household to take care of.
bad,"There are much better retail companies to work for!  Dollar General will expect you to multitask all day and everyday.  You will be wrote up and fired for not completing unrealistic tasks.  You will be working with a skeletal crew and the training is a joke!  Rampant theft and shoplifting is the norm....get use to it.  You will not be valued for you hard work, but they are quick to write you up.  If you are a hardworking,  loyal and decent employee, you can get a job anywhere. Horrible work environment."
bad,If you can handle getting yelled at all the time and not feeling like your good enough this is a job for you they always hired outside employees instead of moving you up in the company I was passed up 4 times for a full time assistant manager position I finally quit.
bad,Terrible management at some many stores. Its like they're going down hill. The DM's don't care and hours get cut consistently. Always being called in.
bad,The first manager I had went on Maternity leave. The next manager got a big ego. I was wrongly fired for something I didn't do. Never apply here its not worth it.
bad,"They don't pay overtime, don't get paid for lunches but have to work through them, they work you to death and short staffed badly, leaky roofs and no working store phone lines"
bad,"Should pay more"
bad,"I will never work for them again nor do I intend to tell my friends or enemies for that matter, never apply, cause it takes a month to finally start working,then wish you never started.unless you like being by yourself All day and angry customers because lack of payroll, you have to cover entire store."
bad,They work you to death no raises  treat you poorly after years of being loyal I left . This is in arizona I worked out of state for the same company and they were amazing but here management sucks.
bad,this is for people needing experience or a second job. it's not a job you want to work at. it's stressful. you get a lot of hours on some days others you barely  get any. you have to deal with a lot of rude customers.
bad,They were completely unpredictable and unprofessinal Withheld payment to suffice for others. They would take hours from one employee and give to another without warning. Worked extra days and what should have been considered overtime but was never paid. Horrible managers. Not worth the 8.75.
bad,horrible gm. had to learn everything on my own. always suck doin the same thing everyday. never learning anything new. was labeled part time employee but was forced to work 43hrs. a week and only one day off.
bad,"There  was always 2 managers but only cashier and that one cashier was responsible for taking care of customers and doing recovery while the managers were no where to be found. During rushes you were the only cashier at the register, with little to no help at all. They should hire an even amount of cashier to managers. Overall, low pay and horrible commute and horrible managers."
bad,"I personally do not like working retail, it is too slow paced and tedious for me. It is a good first job for teenagers trying to get job experience to further their career"
bad,If your a cashier you are left on the cash register by yourself and help EVERY customer that came in no help from the managers you have to stock all the totes from the truck by yourself. If you are a manager or sales lead you are left most of the time 3 to 4 hrs by yourself to run the cash register with no other co-workers there. You have to recover the store by yourself. My manager told me when I tooth’s sales lead position I would never loose my job and look where I am now not working at dollar general. Schedule was never posted on time
bad,Dollar General doesn't treat their employees with the respect they deserve. It's always a fight for a day off because they don't want to pay cashier's enough for what is expected of the job. They don't pay any hourly employee the amount of money the job is worth. There's always turn overs with cashiers. And full time key employees are left to work as cashiers which causes the stores to not run efficiently
bad,"I mean I worked here for extra money I wasn’t the best on time employee after my a car wreck trying to get to work was hard but I surely made up for the lost few minutes it was just too much for $8.50 "
bad,Poor poor service I did not like working there .. the manager was a very poor and rude manager i wouldn't advise anyone to work there it's just not a job yiu would enjoy going to everyday
bad,Horrible company horrible management and very disorganized never a dull moment in the store always theft and drama continuously corporate is also the worse they lie as well so sad
bad,"No hours ,hectic work place everybody does there own little thing no team work.would have been a good job just definitely needed more hours and better pay"
bad,Believed my job would be much less stress and that the store manager was good at her job. This was not true. She made me do her work and took the credit.
bad,"For every 6 hours you work you get a 30 minute break. For every 8 hours you work you get an hour break. Management likes to screw you over by scheduling you for 5.75 hour shifts or 7.75 hour shifts, that way you are robbed of your break even though you end up staying on the clock longer than you scheduled for anyways."
bad,"Theres lot of things that happened while i was there.... However I left bc agter running a large storw by MYSELF for almost a month, theh brought a brand new Manager in and he tried to completely change everything! Not for the right reasons either!!! Plus they wanted me to work overtime which is normally good however I made less weekly with ot than I did weekly with 39.75 hrs. 39.75"
bad,Not a place i recommend anyone working. Company don't care about employees unless you are in management. They expect to get their truck in a timely manner but don't let the employs get overtime. All they care about is making money and not taking care of the employees.
bad,"Seemed a good job at first , but after the first weeks it wasn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t show up , I would get called if I could come in being that this was my first job I always came in to look good and for extra money. I ended up getting a second job as they started to cut my hours and the manager didn’t like that, he wouldn’t work around my schedule so I had to call the person above him so he could work around me. The manager would always put just girls by themselves to close at night never guys , he only scheduled me nights and when I asked for him if he could put me in the morning he said no. Some leads and the assistant manager would stand around doing nothing so would end up doing double the work when it came to recovering the store."
bad,"From the time I started til I left things got bad with management. I was a lead sales associate barely getting $9.75 hr while other LSA were getting more."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. Bad pay, bad hours, managers are expected to work alone all the time and no flexibility for the staff or managers. District manager is a poor leadership. To much stress and the pay and benefits are poor. They lie about what a great company they are."
bad,"I worked in a ""low volume"" store as Asst Manager. I was expected to run register,stock and do all my management duties while being alone in the store by myself for 3+ hrs at a time. I ran register/waited in customers almost non stop while I was somehow supposed to do all my management duties and stocking duties. Which is impossible when you're the only employee in the 9store. My store definitely was not a low volume store. 1 of two stores in small town."
bad,Very bad work environment. Coworkers  are not friendly with each other. Employees are very rude to customers. The store was very DIRTY. No structure at all.
bad,Theres nothing positive about working for this company! Store manager was great. Assistant Manager should not be allowed to train or even work with the public. Way to much gossip. Not enough employees.
bad,"My training was put off to clean a fire hazard of a hoarders store, wall to wall to ceiling with freight & then pulled all my labor hours & told me I would be working open to close for several weeks  & wasn’t in the system to complete anything nor did I know what bank to use & was told to drive across city to go get my own keys to store, had no printer & 2 employees. Then training wasn’t important"
bad,"If the employees would unionize, they would put up with less stuff and dollar general would have to treat employees fairly. UNION! UNION! UNION! Unionize!!!"
bad,Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. They cut your hours they talk to you like you're beneath them. The assistant manager stays hiding in the back.
bad,I worked for them for 8 months and within that time i went from a cashier to key with promise of the assistant manager position when it came time for me to be the assistant they found a ridiculous reason to fire me and they listed me as not rehireable which i fill was not fair at all seeing how I worked 7 days a week with at least working open to close 2-3 days out of the week.
bad,Working there you get passed over for better jobs in the company they do not move you up you have to fight to get any where in the company. Its a hostile work environment people get away with alot of stuff they say to you. Its not the best place for good people who will work there butt off to move up in a company. This job is just not worth your time! If your a key holder you will have to work on your lunch if your cashier needs help.
bad,"My manager was a great manager,  district manager was a coniving whorish pastor that sleeps with his workers, and never stood up for us when we were accused of doing wrong after being taught the way we were trained"
bad,"I am a recently self separated store manager and left due to no family life no payroll hours and having to do everything myself with no thank you no care in the world for there employees, just replace them they say, and calling corporate is like pulling teeth, you never get a straight answer"
bad,"It’s a fast paced job, they have poor  management, there are no benefits, there call you in every day that you get off and when you clock out they’ll ask can you stay and help"
bad,"All feedback was negative. Nothing was ever good enough. They didn't train me well. Many things I had to teach myself and was only able to do that because of my prior experience in cashiering. But still sometimes, I had to ask for help and they thought something was wrong g with me until I told them that no one trained me. There was a lot of pressure to do everything perfectly but not enough help during my shift. They were changing my schedule every day. I had no off days ...."
bad,It would've been better but the district manager was a sexist jerk whom allowed a manager to literally throw objects and degrade the female employees without any punishment made to the store manager. Yet retaliated against females for taking it to HR.
bad,Extremely tiring and also no work life balance if you have a family it’s not the job for you extremely long hours and stressful days horrible turnover
bad,"I was promoted to manager quickly, put into a store that was a train wreck and expected to fix it in 30 days. The expectations were to work 70 plus hours a week. Worst work experience of my life."
bad,"Dollar General is one of the worst companies to work for! The boss there is a complete control man with obvious control issues. Dollar General has a bunch of Thieves and drug addicts that come in there, high and mad because you caught them stealing. The only decent part about Dollar General was the employees that I became friends with with."
bad,"I worked for dollar general for two years and it was the worst job experience I ever had. Management sucks, scheduling sucks, thebwhole company sucks. Benefits aren't worth anything. I was constantly being texted in work group chat, constantly being called in on my days off."
bad,"A typical day is very hectic. Nothing is organized. You are given enough hours or help to carry out tasks. Your hours are cut, even though you are not the one who went over. You are encouraged to work off the clock.  You  are not recognized for the work that you do. It was not a pleasant experience, except for some of the customers."
bad,Very stressful. Manager was not easy to get along with. Work for company for 4 years to only have person for 9 months come in and get position that I deserved. Really messed up
bad,"Dollar General is an unfortunate joke.  I have worked retail for 10 plus years including being a manager, and I have never seen such poor management in a company in my entire life.  A typical day at work there makes you want to give up and kill yourself.  There is no help, not a good workplace, and horrible communication with the above management."
bad,"Long hours, no time off, high expectations with limited staff. District manager had unrealistic expectations for a high shrink store that required more hours than were given."
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not care about their employees. The pay is way to low. No matter how much money you saved the company they still wont pay you fairly.
bad,Bad behavior lying is rewarded and good hard workers are lied on persecuted not enough pay or compensation to make whats expected from you sop doesnt match what actually goes on alot higher up personel is shifty and will lie set you up fire you to cover their antics
bad,"This place is a joke to work for. Even their full time employees never get 40 hours, they expect way too much of everyone & their register is ancient."
bad,Store manager. It was bad don’t do it not worth your time or mental health. The screwed me over on my maturity leave they cheated mangers out of pay and keep younon such a tight skeleton crew no one can call in.
bad,"This company will work the dickens out of you and then fire you. There is no quality of life there and the store is always a mess.  I was the Store Manager and hated going to work, the only thing that kept me going was my remarkable team."
bad,Manager was difficult. Close one night and open next morning not even eight hours between shifts. Paycheck was short and never did get all pay owed to me. Manager micro managed some people. I quit soon after being hired. Lost interest with such hostility being displayed.
bad,"I learned that just because you have an opinion, if it’s not good, you should not express it. Every experience will be different, while I wouldn’t refer anyone, I wouldn’t discourage them either."
bad,i worked for Dollar General for a year in that time i was doing store manager job for 8.75 and hr i was work 80 hour weeks then the store manager i transferred to cut my worked hours and still currently has a job so a lawsuit will be filed
bad,"Manager isn't friendly and orders you around. Doesn't train you at all if you've worked at a Dollar General previously. Coworkers were okay. Job isn't worth $8 an hour. If they don't like you, you won't get many hours. If you have restrictions, don't bother because management will try to get you to leave by being disrespectful."
bad,I did not like this experience. The new manager seemed very racist in some situations and fired me due to me also attending school and giving her my schedule saying she would help me work with it.
bad,Worked as a manager for 6 months because the day I started the manager quit .then they hired me lady’s and put them and manager and assistant manager  worked hours with no pay
bad,Its just the worst retail job I've ever had.The company is only concerned with the bottom line and all employees are replaceable so that's how your treated.Dont waste your time!
bad,There is no training for hired position. Very unprofessional management which creates a hostile work environment. Under staffed and under paid for the expectations of one individual or the whole team. No room for advancement.
bad,"Went through Store Managers a lot, and when you apply for Store Manager position; your interview was only one question. Do you think you can handle it? That was the interview"
bad,to me wasn't good place work management wasn't very good. .I didn't have many hours I only 10 week  and hard part was have care people very day and they attude
bad,I would never recommend working here !! Run run !! Store managers are required to work 60 to 70 hours a week and only get paid for 40 !! Poor upper management! They set employees up for failure is so sad ! No life home balance
bad,Not worth it in the end. I loved the customers but the assistant manager was always rude. She would curse behind the register and nothing would be done
bad,"Pay and benefits are way below industry standards  I was promised certain things at the interview and they were never delivered upon."
bad,One of the worst companies I ever work for.  The pay was absolutely horrible and this company trusts no one. They treat employees and vendors like thieves and there is nothing you can do about it.
bad,"I learned from dollar general that you need to be fast pace to get the job done between customers, on wednesday is when the truck delivery is. So it was around Christmas time,so we had to pull alot of freight to the floor in order to unload the truck, so we had to move fast on order to make room down the aisle for the customers to shop.we had some complaints that the store was not shoppable and they couldn't get down the aisle, so me, i I apologie to the customers ask them what could i get for them, they would tell me i would go get it for them they would thank me and once again i apologize to them and they were happy. So working at dollar general was a struggle. but i loved all the customers and they appreciated me."
bad,"Horrible job, expected to do many things at once. I'm not an octopus."
bad,"The upper management in corporate have no idea what happens in the stores. The District Managers have their favorite managers, their stores get everything  and get away with so much. While stores that actually bust their butts and work get nothing."
bad,"Store manager promised a raise and assistant manager position and never got. She was being hired off the streets as assistant manager instead of promoting from within. NEVER had a personal life and she texted me day and night even on my days off which was only one day a majority of the time. There were times that i even had to work ony day off. OH, AND I WAS HOMELESS THE FOR SIX OUT OF SEVENONTHS"
bad,I went there with manager experience and they gave me minimum wage. I had more retail experience than the manager yet I got paid the least. Only job I've ever had that was just a waste of my potential.
bad,"worst place on earth to work worst place to work worse place to work ,upper management is a joke they have no idea what they are doing store level is a joke aslo"
bad,"Don’t work here unless you want to be over worked and under paid with rude costumers and short staffed, you will get nothing done, store manager has favorites so don’t expect to get a lot of days off you requested"
bad,"If you enjoy coming in on your scheduled days off, staying over, coming in early, and getting passed up for promotions due to the fact that they will offer higher positions to people off the street before they offer a loyal, hard working employee (with proven customer service skills and satisfaction) a chance to step up, then this may be just the job for you. If not, apply elsewhere. This place is a joke!"
bad,Did not like working dollar General.do not care about their employees under paid manager in lakeland ga make you work off the clock when task isn't finished
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone the worst work environment the worst leads ever the hours suck and the company is not out for there employees
bad,If you work at dollar general you will do the work of 5 people. It dont matter what your position is. The budget that the managers get is laughable. Upper management thinks you are superman/superwoman. Upper management wont come and do what you do on a daily basis.
bad,Lazy associates. You have to work extra hard to make up for the slackers. Not fair at all. The district let's EVERYTHING fall upon deaf ears! They listen to Nothing you say. Worst place ever !!!
bad,Work managers 70+ hours a week just to make weekly labor budget... you spend all your time cashiering and working freight. Horrible company to work for
bad,It really wasnot a good job for me . Not enought hours for me. Every week i to ask for hours. And i ddinot make enought mpney there. Like every week u didnot got any hpurs
bad,"They are constantly hiring but only gave me 4 hours a week. Promised promotion then cut me back to no work. When the manager left the company, he black balled everyone who worked for him."
bad,"My manager was really good at what he does. Unfortunately, the corporate people expect the impossible and never hire enough people to get the job done. It was like they were trying to pay to have minimum amount of people. If you got over time, they treated it like the world would end. Corporate treats employees like criminals. Who would want to work for these people for long?!"
bad,Worst place I ever worked for.  Management constantly changed and was forced out by new SM.  Made life miserable and not allowed to perform the job I was hired for.  Don’t regret quitting on the spot
bad,"I should have known after my first week working for this company that I needed to run the other way. my third day on the job the manager handed me my keys and left me alone in the store for three hours. I was never properly trained and neither was any associate hired after me. Store was filthy with expired product everywhere and I got sick often as a result. The manager was sloppy and had no clue how to manage anything. Not sure how they hire them but maybe that should change. Hours are given to the few (2-3) employees who actually complete tasks and everything is expected of them, they must do everyone's jobs. The others worked few hours and never received disciplinary action for fire-able offenses. This job became so miserable there were multiple occasions I, an adult, would cry on my way, at work, or on my way home because of the ridiculous working environment."
bad,"I didn't get the help that I needed when working there. The system didn't work half the time. The people that worked there didn't follow procedures. They weren't willing to help most of the time. They didn't take time to tell you what you were doing wrong and what you could do to fix it. Before laying you off. They didn't give the appropriate lunch hours that you are supposed to get. I don't think the company gave me enough training on a cash register. Most of the time it was only me on the register, which was overwhelming."
bad,"Understaffed, they pick favorites, the store is poorly run & always negative, they like to blame certain people for certain things and talk about them"
bad,Horrible company to work for and the managers are hard to work for. You dont get paid nearly enough for how much work you do. They treat thier cashiers like dirt.  Cashiers are expected to do a lot of the work and at the sametime ring people up.
bad,"They change the schedule way too much. Then they proceed to write you up given the fact that they change the schedule and do not let you know. there is no email, group text, there’s nothing. You will have to go in everyday to check the schedule and if like myself you live an hour away it’s just not feasible"
bad,Management made me not like it. Unprofessional. Disrespectful. Terrible communication.                                          The store manager deserves to get fired
bad,Store manager had many store policies to follow including working at least two closing shifts and two opening shifts per week. Always opened the store with another associate without being a key holder and left that associate with her manager keys without attendance with the manager keys to the store as well as she also knew safe codes which she was not supposed to know at all.
bad,Pay is low. Management is unreliable and turn over is very very high. I would not recommend working there. They do not work with school schedules and they expect you to pick up the slack when other workers quit (and again the turn over is constant).
bad,"corporate requires effort that exceeds a respectable maximum given that they offer minimum pay "
bad,Management is terrible and store is a nightmare. They pick and choose who they like at the moment and do schedule that way it's a horrible place and environment.
bad,They work with you but they dont have good corporate.it they didnt care about anything at all so i didnt like working there. Plus after having my son they would not let me off
bad,Disliked. Made me work with 103 fever and throwing up. I had pneumonia. She didn't care. They aren't family oriented or at least that manager wasn't. Told me dollar General came over my kids.
bad,"60-90 hour work week, availability must be 24/7/365 for managers, including vacations.  Staffing is minimal due to allotted hours.  Working alone and completing all daily tasks while providing prompt & excellent customer service is mandatory. Only would I recommend employment at the corporate level."
bad,A very negative and a very demanding environment to work in. not for everybody. they will tell you to work only so many hours but then not give you enough payroll to get the job done therefor making you work many hours for free
bad,It would be a good place to work but if you value your life you would not accept a job here. The shoplifters will threaten your life. One of them even hit the pregnant manager in her face and the company did not do anything to assure our safety. They only care about there mercandise and making money your safety is last.
bad,Cuts employee hours COMPANY wide on a consistent basis in order pay for the building of new stores. Then turns around and expects the same production as if there were no cuts made. When you tell them that its impossible to do the same work in way less time they act like your speaking another language and ignore it. Then ask the same dumb production questions a few days later.
bad,Store manager never trained people and would complain when new hires did something wrong. Left all training up to the assistant and then would tell other managers that her assistant wasn’t worth promoting and that they were lazy. Store manager would also yell and cuss at the workers if they said or did something wrong and would go out of her way to cause problems between workers. District manager never answered their phone and is generally unhelpful. Would not recommend working here to anyone unless you are absolutely desperate for a job.
bad,While working at DG it was very stressful. From upper management (HR and DM) to store manager expected huge results in 5 hours or less.  If not hours was cut. No room for advancement for employees who has been there for years.  They would rather hire someone with no experience for management than promote inside. Then the DM would complain about them.  And give unrealistic task.
bad,the only good thing i can say about them is they worked with me on the schedule. i did a ton of work for what i was paid and the type of people that come in there are terrible.
bad,"The management was poor, young 20 yr old guy not ready for that kind of responsibility..made poor decisions, made mistakes in schedule several times..he finally realised he couldn't handle it and quit after I left..."
bad,"Labor model is set to keep the top executives pockets full and the everyday associates poor. Not a place to grow or advance. Told I had to work 42 to 48 hours a week, but I could not do it in 5 days. There had to be a 6th day to complete the hours. No help in the store."
bad,"Drama drama drama couldn’t stand working with a bunch of women who acted like elementary kids... the manager was poorly qualified for her position...everyday was like dealing with a bunch of immature adults.. fighting fussing constantly I knew about everyone business and I didn’t want to..,the manager told everyone personal business gossip central.. I didn’t last a month"
bad,"I was hired on the spot. There was no interview. The first day I went in for ""training"" and ended up working a shift because someone quit. By the end of the week, four people had quit, including me. I was the only one who gave a two-week notice. I was handed a set of keys the second day with NO TRAINING. The first two days I worked a total of 24 hours. I happily handed the keys back as soon as I found out there was someone qualified to take them. I did NOT see the manager except once for the first three days. I was placed on the register alone while the other cashier went and put away her stock. I had back to back customers most of the day. Two hours before I was to leave the other cashier finally came upfront and told me I would be written up if I didn't finish unloading stock. This was the first time I had heard this all day. I gave a verbal notice then. I handed a written notice in the next day. The notice was rejected, and I was told I would simply finish out that week. I tried to clean the place multiple times because the store has roaches. This only seemed to aggravate the manager further. Under the circumstances, I called a prior interviewer and asked if he was still hiring. He was on the condition I started immediately. I sent a text on the store group text thing politely apologizing about the short notice, thanked them for their time and wished them luck. The manager's text response was ""Good riddance"" Needless to say, I have kept the text and all documentation. This was a very interesting place to work."
bad,The company didn't care that you didn't have a life or a day off. They just wanted to make sure that your store didn't go over on budgeted hours even though your store was 20% over on budgeted sales for a 2.5 million dollar store. I was working 90 hours a week without a day off. My truck was the entire 53 foot trailer and the load still had to be thrown in 1 1/2 days without any extra hours.
bad,It would be a great place to work at if there were more staff during the shifts. More security. More company backing of employees when customers steal and run out of the stores with merchandise
bad,"As a previous manager the duties are endless. From opening the store ,setting up registers, cleaning up the parking lot, making bank deposit's (yourself) handling the register, checking the system for daily tasks, which everyday there was something new and different that needed to be completed. Running around like a maniac when you get a one day notice of a corporate visit. They hire outside people as DM who know less about the company and the DG process. I was there for almost nine years and was terminated for protecting myself as one of my co managers had been robed and killed. That being said I don't regret protecting myself, I feel that perhaps the DM could take daily deposits to bank. This has been the most stressful, contradicting and abusive company that I have ever worked for.I did enjoy interacting with the customers.The hardest part is following the work flow.... Not possibly if you still have all the daily tasks to be  completed. They forget  that you are only one person."
bad,Working for this company is extremely difficult and stressful.  The benefits and compensation for this company is not worth the people and the workload that you have to deal with.
bad,"Takes advantage of you, worked 11,12,13 days straight and still wouldn't get 40 hours. Expected too much work done with no hours to give employees. No appreciation for job well done"
bad,Racist company Who does not look into situation within their company. Their is a a lot of favoritism going on within the company and thins that should not be happen and nothing being due about it even when reported.
bad,"Overworked - under paid. required to work 48 hours (worked more like 80) per week. DM is unsupportive. Ignores requests for help, favors certain managers and ignores others. Favorites of the DM get away with unethical activities including falsifying work hours.  DM has hours charged to other stores to keep her budget in line as well as padding inventory for stores at inventory.  Managers that are in her click are promoted whereas other managers get demoted or overlooked.  The whistle blower act / protection is a joke as when a manager in her click is reported, retaliation is quick and deadly.  The DM gives no support to ""HER TEAM"" and leaves them to flounder with no staff. When the stores fall behind with minimal staff, the DM pulls people from other stores and leaves the stores short handed.  You are threatened that if you tell upper management you will be terminated. The pay goes by the store and store managers receive between 28K and 40K depending on the store as a starting wage.  But figure in the hours and you make less than your part time sales associates.  They dont consider leads to be managers but expect them to complete management duties.  Problems with firecodes, health code violations, and building management issues are pushed aside until the building is cited by the city. Store look like trash as they do not keep landscapers.   If you want no home / family life then this is the job for you as you will be required to give up your family and any social time for 80 plus hours."
bad,"Pros:Weekly pay"
bad,I would not ask or tell anyone to go get a job at they dollars general store to save your self some time they will work you like there no tomorrow...............
bad,"Overall, if I knew what I would be going through before I started, I would have looked for other employment. The management was unfair and used bias and favoritism."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,No training. Bottom of the barrel customers. No hours to schedule employees to actually do the job. Very depressing environment. The workload is unmanageable.
bad,Manager was the youngest store manager in the whole district. He constantly punished employees for calling in by making them work 16 hour days the next.
bad,"I don't recommend this job at all. Pay sucks, they expect you to work off the clock. Sometimes you work a whole shift by yourself. Please don't waste your time."
bad,Was hired in as store manager and had to pick up the slack from past managers that weren’t doing their job. Should have never started to work in this store until I was sent for training. Never had any training. Had a crew come in to get the store cleaned up. There was no space left in the stockroom because of so much overstock. They expect the store manager to work pretty much everyday ifyou are short handed
bad,I was not crazy about this job at any point of working there. The money wasn't good and the hours were not good either you didn't get very many hours. I was a key holder but I got paid like a cashier and I had a lot of responsibility and didn't get the pay or the recognition I deserved.
bad,"DG is by far, the worst company I've ever dealt with! There's no work/life balanced.  Stores don't have the hours needed to run the business; however, the SM is basically FORCED to be there nearly everyday...working w/o a lunch break...10-12 hours per day."
bad,Don't give appropriate hours or pay. Manager expects cashiers to do their jobs without management pay ..................................................
bad,"Awful, horrible. Don’t do it. Bad management. Drunk customers. Lazy bosses. Hours were dramatically cut for whole district. Didn’t get notice. Didn’t get properly trained and was told to sell alcohol while I was underage"
bad,My manager was completely unprofessional. Not even a whole month in (barely trained) and I was to blame for things that had been going wrong in the store for months if not years! Temple Ave Newnan Georgia! Not worth the minimum wage!
bad,"Please do not work at dollar general, unless you have no other choice. The pay is horrible but they want you to do everything. Lead Associate, Assistant Managers and Managers do the same work but get three different pay rates. The store is never staffed properly and management will not change anything to help their workers. But the minute you can't complete your task it's some how your fault. Please work anywhere else."
bad,Dm's and regional not interested in helping with the day to day that needs addressed.   They worry about bottom line and making sure you don't go over paperwork.   Although I made a higher salary. In order to make payroll I had to work the hours my self so when I figured it out I made less than 10 dollars an hour and it was not worth the headache
bad,"Working there was terrible. They expect you to do everything, stock, clean, help customers, all while running the front and checking out customers. I was working 60 plus hours a week because they absolutely could not get anyone to stay employed."
bad,"I personally think that this company is one of the worse I have ever worked for. During my time at this company I was routinely pass over for promotions. I was once passed over by a subordinate employee that I trained. The amount of nepotism that exist in every level of this company makes it impossible to advance based on actual performance and worthiness, instead it often boils down to who you know or who you are related to. That's fine for a mom and pop establishment but for a national chain it's disgraceful and should be embarrassing to them but its not. Quite frankly this company is a reflection of many of the issues that plague this country. I personally go out of my way  to not shop there, even when it is more convenient than other options."
bad,Not a very understanding place to work for. When it came to emergencies and taking off they give you a hard time. Then they expect you to do other people’s jobs
bad,"Horrible job,poor management, I would not recommend this job to anyone. It doesn’t pay much at all. Rude general manager, worst experience ever. Stressed work environment."
bad,"The job description is a lie. 90+ hours, no help, nothing ever fixed, little training. Only hire in PT so employees are hard to get and hard to keep. They pile on more and more expecting you to keep up with managerial duties and keep the store running which consists of doing all the jobs, cashier, stocking, cleaning, and planograms."
bad,This place will work you to death while paying you the most minimal as possible. It is common to be asked to work off the clock if you are a key holder. This place should be shut down for it's business practices.
bad,"The district manager lies that pay raise will come and it never does. He has no idea how to even work the register! How am I supposed to respect and try to learn from this man who has never worked a day in his life behind the register. Lies to your face. loved working and interacting with customers, but managment pushes you to your breaking point. Im a team player it got old real fast."
bad,The employees & management there didn't care about anything besides barely the bare minimum. The people who managed the place & the area in South Texas were the most cold no-personality shills I've ever met.
bad,Work week usually consists of 6 days a week with one day off. Sometimes you'll work almost 14 days before getting a day off. Never enough staff scheduled to get done the work that needs to be done.
bad,"A bad manger can take a good staff and destroy it, causing the best employees to flee and the rest to lose motivation. That's my experience.Unfair to workers, take mangers side even when they are wrong. Company don't check on mangers poor attitude towards workers and customers. And store 08019 need a more professional manger that is fair with all workers that have second jobs. I was told that i could't work both jobs and as assistant manger Dollar General on give 32hrs . So as everyone else kept their job and i step down and the manger went a hire for spike someone else as the assistant who has a full time teacher assistant job and never avalible in the mornings, but cost me my job."
bad,Only two workers during a shift. Sometimes I was alone in the store off by itself in a wooded area. Long lines couldn't get help from the manager. I had to stock and run the cash register.
bad,Do yourself a favor.  Do not ever volunteer.  It is not appropriatees. They only work full timers about 30 to 32 hours a week.  Get mad if you call in sick. Expect a person to unload truck and run register and recover shelves in a 6 hour shift.
bad,I really did not have a day off. I worked nights all the time. You had to work cashier and stock person. They never had enough people. I worked Monday through Sunday and never really got a lunch when I worked.
bad,A lot of work and basically pay little to nothing. More of a job for a high school student looking to earn a little money or if you're looking for just a part time. No holidays off except Christmas Day.
bad,"Dont work here.Just not a good place to work I hated it every day and was constantly called in.For awhile there was only 3 employees at the store and was expected to work all day,every day we hired people which takes forever in thier process,4-6 weeks.HORRIBLE PLACE"
bad,This company doesn't care about there employees they work you like a run away slave treat you like dirt and don t pay well do not apply there if you do you will not have a life you can t make plans can t take vacations
bad,The district manager only protect the managers they like. They will lie about you to protect themselves. expect managers to forget about their families to just focus on working
bad,I was a keyholder. I had a cashier giving me a hard time. I asked the store manager for a sit down with the cashier on 4 separate occasions. The situation escalated to the point of me having to call the sheriff station to have the cashier's mother removed from the property. My manager refused to handle the situation and just ignored it.
bad,Terrible place to work.  Would not recommend.  They expect too much.  Always understaffed and stressful.  Turn over is ridiculous.  Upper management is terrible.
bad,The district manager is incompetent. He does not support managers. The company sucks balls. If you stay out of management and make no money you can enjoy having a job.
bad,Been attacked by the same customer 3 times before dollar general did anything my house was shot up because a customer was arrested for theft and you get cursed out by customers a lot
bad,Managers expect employees to do 99% of the work around the store while also running the register. Never given requested days off. I had to constantly fight them to get days off for doctor appointments while I was pregnant and high risk.
bad,"DO NOT WORK THERE UNLESS YOU ARE DESPERATE FOR MONEY, you are overly worked with little pay. Long hours and hard work. Gets robbed not a safe environment and dirty"
bad,"I would not recommend this employer. The store manager is horrible. The store is not clean. There is not enough workers. It was just a horrible experience. If you can stay away from this place, please do so"
bad,"I was hired in at full time by mistake, so my manager scheduled me at part time hours. I had to work in 2 different stores to get my hours. I wouldn't work there again if I had a choice. Pay sucked as did management. I was hired in as a shift manager, but found out that if I was promoted to the position, I'd be making almost $1 more.  The district manager even said that we couldn't close early because of the snow.  The roads were getting bad & he wanted us to stay open EVEN THOUGH it was getting unsafe to drive. Like I said, I'd never work there again by choice."
bad,"Organization does not value its employees. Though there is a training program, there is no payroll or support for it. Good luck getting any of the staff trained within the first 2 weeks, let alone the first 2 months. Hourly staff passes through quickly due to heavy workload and poor pay. Managers either make it through a year, then burn out by three years, or evaporate within 4-6 months. No support for DM's in hiring, or fixing problem stores that they are saddled with from day 1. The standing direction is, 'well that's what we hired you to fix, now fix it (with non-existent resources). DMs seem to be connected to a revolving door."
bad,The store manager here has no regards for you unless your her best friend. I've been working there since jan19 and she has drastically cut my hours. Hiring 4 new people when I've repeatedly told her I'm available 24/7 and day any time. But still proceeds to give the newbies. MORE HOURS than me. When they have another job and I don't.
bad,"Dollar General is an awful place to work ! Some of the co-workers can be cool , but they will hire people that have no common since and really lazy people and managers ! My first manager was cool and worked hard and the crew worked good for him ! After he left the other managers had no clue and they had no personality ! The store is always a mess ! Cages of product all over and selves empty ! Usually 1 or 2 people working no matter how busy and how much work to do ! This company is a joke ! Always a mess and Corporate does not care as long as the make their money ! They also treat the employees bad !"
bad,"They dont care to work their managers 80-100 hrs a week with no sympathy or help from higher ups. Company is ridiculous just horrible.  No work life balance, the company demands your every waking breath."
bad,The job was very difficult no proper training the company stats that in competitive it is not starting people at 8 when McDonald starts at 9 or ten an hr
bad,"I never worked a register before, but got the hang of it quite quickly, I took my time so I would not make errors, but I had one manager who wasn't happy with my scan times, didn't matter that I came in for others call offs, cleaned up store nicely at night, etc. She was rude and cussed me out for slow scan times, so I quit as my shift was to start, she made sure all the employees and customers knew I quit! Afterwards I called DG main corporate office to make a complaint, they did nothing!"
bad,Store manager not acting as store manager. Hypocrisy and racism presented itself a few times. Favoritism was a major issue at this job. Part time employees receiving more hours than the Full time employees.
bad,"This is the absolute worst place I have ever worked for. There was one night that it was storming really bad and there were sirens going off outside. There was a tornado touched down literally across the field and they didn't stop us to have us go take cover. They made us keep working! When asked about the sirens over the radio, management told us that it wasn't sirens we were hearing and that it was just the conveyor in another MOD. They work you like a slave and will blame you for everything. If you so much as sprain your wrist they will write you up. The write up isn't even the icing on top of the cake. If you sprain your wrist (or have an incident of any kind) you have to sit in the office with the supervisor to fill out an incident report, then they call matrix and you get treated over the phone! The rate system is a joke,  if you do manage to operate over 100% rate for the week the rate bonus is a whopping $5. It is not worth your time or your stress.  9000% do not reccomend"
bad,Worked for Dg for almost 6 years was not offered a position.  But they classified me as lead cashier.  Worked with 2 people on shift had to do stocking of store and cashier over worked.  No pay for the 3 day leave for death in family.  Closing of store that means cleaning sweeping moping of bath rooms sometimes working off clock.  Their is more
bad,Nice place to shop for cheap merchandise. Manager kept changing only brought home 200  a week not enough to pay the bills when you have kids.no money.
bad,don't want to talk about this job. it is time for me to move on to something better with more pay then what they pay u for and all the work that they want you to do
bad,"in this location customers are very rude , would throw acohol on you if they didn’t have there Id and you refused sale "
bad,Constantly having my schedule changed and being called in constantly at the last possible minute just about every time at the worst hours eventually led me to exhaustion and getting vertigo.  I was only given two weeks to recover  from my manager before I was  removed from the schedule. It took me a month to recover from.
bad,"The worst place to work they would have you work 4 hours a day two times a week. My sister passed away and when I called the manager and she said  "" well there's not any thing you can do for her because she's dead so come on in to work""."
bad,I wouldn't apply for this company they careless and inconsistent with their rules. They lie to get you in the door. Say they will work with your schedule then penalize you if you can't make it or late.
bad,Worst place to work at. Manager constantly changes the schedule talks to ppl like their stupid and bothers me on my days off with work drama and other employees talk badly about one another and if a task didn’t get don’t it was our butts.. I went from being a very happy person to someone that has high blood pressure and anxiety all the time so much my chest hurts... they are good to you in the beginning it over time it gets worse
bad,"This is the worst company , do not care about employees. Managers take credit for all the hard work you did , condones managers to lie , cheat and steal from empoyees"
bad,Horrible worked 70+ hours every week was not appreciated by the district manager or Corp. they give you set things to do daily but then the district manager wants things done and then Corp sends emails of things to do then there is a start task you do I worked by myself for hours no break.
bad,"Managment is terrible. Hours very based on how manager feels. You get tasked to many things with no time to do it. Expect to get no praise for work, only negative feedback. The schedule is a mess so expect to get called in or asked to stay."
bad,"My experience at Dollar General was horrible. I started at minimum wage at a location with terrible management. Work days were crammed with several task and no time to complete anything. Scheduling was inconsistent. I worked hard for over a year and was promoted twice, once from part-time and the again to full time with a key holder responsibility. Key holders are underpaid managers who do everything the store manager recieving competitive salary does, key holders however do not make good money. Workers are expendible at any time and if you give your all to this job do not expect to be promoted, especially if you are not buddy buddy with your store manager. They can ruin your growth with the company. Managers have to give good recommendation for a employee promotion. In my case my store manager lied about my work performance and character in order to keep me at her store. So I was not promoted after becoming a full time key holder. After a year of hard work I was terminated for attendance. The termination was bias and petty because I was transferred to a new location without consent, the new location had different opening and closing hours. Overall my experience was trash, I tried to make something out of nothing and was so a pipe dream. My advice is stay away from Dollar General."
bad,The manager at store  19787 is not a good manager.  My job as a assistant manager would have been great if there was a good store Manager. Dm needs to look into her
bad,"Manager is horrible. Corporate doesn't care about their employees. Lots of reasons why the store cannot keep employees. People were being payed more than me and i was the Full Time Keyholder. If going to work here, be very cautious."
bad,As a store manager the company treats you as a slave to be worked as they please. You will be required to work open to close multiple times a week and be in call 24/7. You will be luck to get one day off a week and your phone will likely be ringing nonstop with work related phone calls. Store managers have a very high devorce rate because you will no longer have a home life.
bad,"Low pay wage, heavy duties, no breaks unless watching register at the same time nothing is set and no full time only top manager can get that. Loading trucks and unloading is very very hard."
bad,The specific one I was placed in was managed by teenagers. Paid minimum wage. I was told one thing upon hire in reverence to hours and would get maybe 15..split in 3 days. .while they were continuously hiring.
bad,Horrible place to work. Overworked underpaid. No benefits. Petty backstabbing managers and lying district manager. Human resources is no help . Most employees Part time so no benefits
bad,They would work you 60 to 65 hours a week and they expect you to do everything because you don’t have enough hours for your staff to work. You as a store manager are there all day alone putting up stock doing end caps set planagrams scanned  train new employees take conference calls everyday or every other day. If you don’t get a good  Survey you on a conference. No breaks can’t eat can’t see your family. The worst ever
bad,Overworked and UNDERPAID. Management needs to be trained properly in order to develop the staff. Stores are always a MESS!! No hours to give but HUGE WORK LOAD. District Manager is NO HELP in supporting the store. All talk and NO ACTION!!! Highly do NOT recommend this place to work at!!🤷🏼‍♀️
bad,"This is not a good place to work. They expect you to get truck done in a four hour shift. The pay is not good they denied my pay raise, said I have to work harder. That I had to earn it, when I was literally doing the Managers  job and my job as an Assistant Manager. Managmaent doesn’t work they’re full 48 hours and they get away with it.  They just pick and choose who they give the opening shifts to, and the pay raises. They don’t appreciate you, but they’re quick to write you up for anything. They accuse you of stealing, and they stereotype. That’s not only the manager that’s also the DM. When I first started working at that store, the customers would always ask me why don’t the employees last here? Now I know why!!! Save yourself the trouble. As a key holder you also have to work on your lunch break “ against the law & store policy “ you cannot leave the premises either."
bad,"Dollar General stays in competition by cutting the cost of labor wherever and whenever possible. There is just no upside to working here. They expect the world of their employees do not want to give anything in return. The best you can hope for is management. Which you can expect to make a whole dollar or two more than the regular employees, work 60 to 70 hours a week. and have to cover for a staff that is constantly turning over because the company does not want to give them hours or pay them. This means that you will end up doing the work. Do not waste your time. Only an idiot would work for this company."
bad,Terrible manager. Understaffed intentionally. Low pay but one of the more demanding and inconsistant jobs ive had. Could be an okay place to work at but the corperate structure is very sloppy. Im honestly surprised the company is expanding so quickly but they know how to cut corners. They thrive because they cator to rural communities that dont have many options.
bad,They pay sucked and the boss stocked me which is against the law cause i called of because i was sick and i am a single mom and went to the store with my dad and got sprite for me and snacks for my kids cause my mom and dad where going to kowatch my children for me she decicided to call and ask the store if i was there and he said ues and i got yelled at and i was told i wasnt allowed to work again until ingot a doctors excuse.
bad,I wotked there for a year! They went through 3 managers the place is a joke. They don't treat people fair. They talk behind customers back as if they was in middle school. They talk about other employees buisness and god forbid you get hurt on the job. The managers don't feel as if they need to help you when you get a lines but scream at you when you have one.
bad,I can't tell you how much I hated that job first of all you didn't have enough people there to do the job on one shift and I was sexually harassed with no help..
bad,"So much work for very little pay. to much inventory its crazy no support"
bad,"Employee safety/security policies lacking. Rotating District mgr. 4 new ones in a year. Unreasonably demands in store operations. Store mgr work 60 hrs weekly as staff budgeted hours cut mid week and due to salary position are required to cover shifts. Many times management is only employee in store. Profits is the game! Intimidate staff suspect employees of thief and  write everyone up for anything its easy to fire them and control your staff if they fear losing job. Terrible toxic product fumes will make you sick. Its not a bargain if items breaks, doesn't clean or isn't regulated.  Labels look like national brands but fraudulent imports from other countries. Beware of out of date items or toxic material used. If you want a job that doesn't care about you for slave wages and demands more then they give apply. Otherwise have some self pride and work else where."
bad,They don’t schedule enough people and they are constantly a revolving door of employees. They expect too much from cashiers and get upset if tasks aren’t handled quickly.
bad,"Favoritism, every day lies,supervisors threaten  the employees,don't make the numbers out you go! Expected to multitask but pay you for one job only.cant take vacation when you want to,it's when they are good and ready."
bad,Dollar General is not an ideal working environment for most people doing retail they treat you unfairly and discriminate against you regardless of disability no given morals or team work mainly treated like garbage to the point of self loathing I have been working here for two years and its not an ideal place to work as your first job at all.
bad,I was a sales associate for 4 years. You are overworked and underpaid. There are no benefits. Not even an employee discount. Corporate does not care about their employees.
bad,To much managers  back stabbing other employees .  To many lies from upper management .  If they didn't like you they set you up for failure . Not a good place to work
bad,It’s a horrible place to work. They will take everything they can get from you then when you get burned out they don’t care they just want more. I usually worked about 80 hours a week and it was still not enough to get everything done. I never got enough payroll to use my employees for projects. Anyway it’s a horrible place for hourly employees to because I started a part time so I know about it too. Good luck
bad,Dollar General discrimination is at and all time high they will tell your business to all employees and they show favoritism against races many people have walked out and quit and many people resign because of these things Corporate won't do anything bout what's going on that's why alot of us just walked out
bad,"First mgr was great. Next Mgr retired, and no new  mgr for 3 months.That mgr did not come in and check on things which was bad on his part. A lot went on, and he didn't care evidentally. . Employees were great to get along with. This 1"
bad,"Even working part-time here you will be expected to fulfill every job task in the entire store for minimum wage. Typically there are only two people working at once, a manager or key holder, and the associate. The associate could be doing everything alone during their time depending on the other person working with them. There are far more problems but they are too many to list here."
bad,Working at Dollar General was stressful and unfair! There were times that I worked by myself and couldn’t take a break and the company would still take a break out and deduct it from my check! I totally hated working for Dollar General
bad,"They gave no in house career advancement. Always brought in outside management. Management did not care about any situations that went on in the store unless it was convenient for them to take care of it. We were left without management for two months and they brought in two managers since who have caused all the employees to quit. The management is always someone under the age of 25 who likes to have the title on manager but doesn't want the responsibility of the job,"
bad,Run as fast as you can far away and don’t look back. Run as fast as you can and never return.  Ultra low pay and chaos.  Run run run far away as you possibly can.
bad,"Hired as a store manager candidate, originally was going to be placed in a store to train but on start date was moved to a different location 30 min away.  Was promised a new store when it opened by the DM and then he retired. Since then switched to a different store to take it over bit have yet to actually communicate with the new DM ( it has been 2 months)"
bad,Dollar General likes to make one person do the work of three. And the yearly raise isn’t enough to compensate for the work and stress of the job. Management is rude to employees and talks down to them.
bad,"It is to hard to describe about Dollar General. It is too much. Unbelievable!!!!!. Dollar General company whether you have experience or not the company don't pay and they expecting you to work harder with a limited hours. Dollar General is all about money. They don't care about their employees, that why they employees, they come and go."
bad,Took over a month to be put on the schedule after being hired. My hours were cut down to 8 hrs. Per week for following company policy. Place is a joke
bad,Dm is worst guy ever did not do his job to scared to lose his job instead of doing what’s right other then that good place...............👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😂
bad,"I would never tell someone to work there. They work you like a dog. The managers are not understanding, if u have kids and have to get off at a certain time, they won't let you. They want to keep u there over12 hrs each day with only 2 30 mins. Breaks"
bad,Thos place is awful and u shouldnt work there! Low pay and not enough hours! They dont have enough folks there to work when its needed! Cheap company!
bad,"It was the worst job I ever had!  If you were lucky to get a raise once a year, it was only .10!  The district manager had no idea what he was doing.  Doesn't matter how hard you work, never get acknowledge."
bad,"Robbed at gun point working there I quit basic cashiering skill it a job not a career."
bad,"Working for dollar general was a slap in the face. Store Manager doesn't manage will. I was dealing with a migraine headache and he completely did not care, he wanted to know how soon could I get in to work. I asked to be moved to morning shift since my son was going back to school and I was told that there wasn't enough room on 1st shift for me."
bad,It was a job. There were things I did and did not agree with but most things come from people hire up that never set foot in the store so not much you can do about it.
bad,"As soon as I clocked in, I would count the till and check in vendors and start the opening the store process.I would then reset the store and pull out discontinued product or move product to proper areas."
bad,No compassion from management or corporate team. You will be just a number. The work is simple. Its the upper management that is the issue. Great supervisors.
bad,"I would not suggest working at dollar General . I applied for part time and was constantly called in on my days off which was spent taking care of my new born son and when I didn’t go in the manager would get mad at me for not coming in on my day off . I was racking up full time hours even though I was only suppose to be part time. The store was disorganized and a wreck due to the fact only two people were scheduled to work at a time . They worked you so hard for every little . I had to run the register , so go backs , stock shelves , clean the store , all at once . And got in trouble if I didn’t . The manager would take badly about you behind your back to other coworkers . She stayed on her phone all the time and don’t help with anything , she was rude . I quit because it wasn’t worth it . Working there was a horrible mistake ."
bad,This was the worst job i have ever had the workload doesnt meet with the hours given to payroll so i was always away from my family so the weekly workload was complete i was always playing catch up no one wanted to follow policy or procedures they allow team members to get away with a lot before they decide to seperate
bad,"The worst decision I ever made. Save your time and go somewhere else. They don't care about their employees, they only care about numbers. Please don't waste your time."
bad,"The store manager was rude, passive aggressive, and uncommunicative."
bad,I was a store manager. District manager fired all of my staff. Set unrealistic goals. I worked from 6 am ton1030 pm 7 days a week. Had to use my personal vacation to pay employees if we went over 40 hrs. Per the district manager. I do not recommend this company to anyone if you have kids or any kind of social life. You will rarely see your kids and you will not have any type of social life.
bad,"District Managers and above only care about themselves, they do not stand up for their employees, only care about the store if it makes them look good.  Definitely did NOT get paid for the amount of hours I was working as a salaried manager."
bad,"In lamest terms, the most unorganized business from corporate on down. Would not recommend to a friend at all. This at least applies to the location in Murfreesboro, NC."
bad,"Incompetent individuals are selected for advancement, and lower workers suffer. Stores become disorganized leading to poor customer satisfaction. Advancement beyond a key holder is rare for motivated individuals."
bad,"Dont ever work at the Dollar General off of 44th and May. Dirty, bad management, and horrible training. Plus im pretty sure my manager gets drunk before his shifts."
bad,The manager I worked for was unfair and had unrealistic expectations and that's all I have to say about this company I'm just wasting letters so I can hit continue
bad,The reason this place is horrible to work is because the key holder and managers are lazy. The work is crucial and the pay sucks. They store is always a mess.
bad,"Unfairness, Favoritism, Liars, Managers Unprofessional. Only Key Holders get hours or some1 related or well known to Store Managers. They all cover for "
bad,"I just graduated college, I was looking for something just until I could take my stateboard license and move onto my career."
bad,"Everything is beyond horrible at every level of the food chain with no security, benefits, or staff to get anything done. Customers walk over employees while higher ups just fire and hire which dosent fix any of its issues."
bad,It was the worst experience. Poor management skills from store manager. Will never work there again. They pay you next to nothing for all the work that you do
bad,"Dollar General is HORRIBLE to its employees. They do not pay well ($8-$9) and they expect you to do everything. At best there will be 2 employees to do what is normally a 4 person job. They are dirty and refuse to fix things. If you do have a clean store, low theft rate, and high sales you will actually be penalized.  "
bad,"Poor customer services. Bad management skills , needs improvement on company management as well. However , good recovery and work ethic is pretty decent at times."
bad,Don't go she pick her favorites and pushes good employee s till they quit and when corporate cuts hours she'll take hours from employee pay she's says she makes salary and doesn't need to come in unless she has too
bad,"This company does not care about their employees. They are all about the bottom line. If you have to go on medical leave, they post your job on Indeed. They do not reach out and help managers in need. You will get stuck working 80+ hours a week. They pay their ASMs, LSAs, and SAs the bare minimum. Each store barely gets any hours and the SM has to cover. Days off for SMs are basically non-existent. There are unrealistic goals to meet and there are no incentives for employees. SAs do not get full time. If you are not full time you do not qualify for benefits or holiday pay. STAY AWAY! DON'T DO IT! ITS NOT WORTH IT!"
bad,The district manager at the store I worked was so bad   She was as fake as could be. You were never recognized for your work. When I started the store was in red when I left the manager and I had brought it back to profit but was not good enough for district manager. This was done in a 6 month period of working 16-24 hours a day. Instead of promoting from within she hired outside company to promote. I would never recommend dollar general to anyone.
bad,"Poor communication, inconsistent employee development is driving inconsistent execution of the business model.  This in turn is driving high employee turnover in the leadership positions across the company.  The employees and the retail customers are not getting their needs consistently met.  Investment needs to be made INTO the people in the business.  The simple things like basic building maintenance for the store locations, store level technology that actually works consistently, and finding ways to develop and retain GREAT employees with career paths are a few root cause issues."
bad,The manager at the store I work at has no common sense at all and is extremely rude to her employees. This job has no benefits other than being paid weekly.
bad,"There exists a very hostile work environment based on unrealistic workloads and inadequate staffing. Due to their labor model, DG expects store managers to fulfill duties of cashier, custodian, stocker, manager and overall keeper of the store instead of providing adequate hours to staff the store.  60 plus hours a week are considered the norm."
bad,They make you clock out at between 9:45 and 9:55 pm and all ypur other work has to be done OFF the CLOCK. So it keeps there pay down. I know my self I have stayed there it 11 pm and 12 pm waiting to go home working when I clocked out at 9:55pm. Many many nights. It does not take care of workers at all's in no way shape or form.
bad,Management did not know how to treat people. They are rude to customers and all they care about is quotes. They are very discriminating and expect off the clock work.
bad,"Dollar General gives a great view of their company from the outside looking in. However the company works you like a slave, for wages that are laughable."
bad,Proved myself and came up the ladder very fast . Too much work so little pay staff working hard at low wages few hours for schedule to staff the store as a manager you must work 55 hrs per week
bad,"No time allowed to get the job done. Not enough salary allotted for staff to get the job done, therefore Store Mgr. must do the rest just to keep the store afloat. DG practices the passive-aggressive ""Burn & Turn"" method of hiring Managers....Hire someone, make promises, Burn them out and turn over the position to someone else. Horrible work atmosphere! Go to Starbucks instead."
bad,Worst job ever. Management was awful. Nobody put products away. Store manager was incompetent and nuts. Everyone hated it there and quit.  Corporate could care less. Store was always a mess.
bad,"The manager at dg didn't like me and I'm not really sure why, I begged for help got told we didn't have the hours, got fired over 5 dollars"
bad,"Do not recommend over worked for little pay, little paid time off, not enough worker, not enough worker hours given to store, have do the work of four people- cashier, asst manager, security and manager."
bad,Never will work there because the employees there are overworked and under paid that’s why i walked out and went to work at dollar tree because they pay me more and give me the things an employee deserves
bad,No training what so eve constant turn over because of manager. Lies about her schedule and makes the key holders work then she leaves for however long she wants to. NEVER works her scheduled shifts so it’s left up to Assnt and key holders to run the store. D.M. Just as bad..... looking for another job now then I’m gone from this horrid Store manager D.M. and Company. Don’t ever apply to work here at DG unless you want to be taken advantage of and low pay...
bad,"Poor management, play favoritism with workers who kiss butts, poor pay for what you have to deal with, and if you went over hours you didn't get paid for it"
bad,"Higher up management doesn't care about you or your store. Doesn't think you should have time for your family, or life out side of there just work and didn't want to help"
bad,Management really sucks and they use and abuse you. My new manager Rosa D. Who had never worked at a Dollar General before was the worst she made me work on days off and get mad and be vindictive if I couldn't which I'm a single mom of a middle schooler would write my schedule the day before the last day to put it out but only for the dm to see and then totally switch it all up on to get her stuff done on time for the dm and then curse and scream at me in front of customers but obviously I was her best worker and would make me work overtime off clock and pay me under the table to get most of her work done even made my 12 yr old daughter work and then I was a 3rd keyhole she said she was paying me $10 an hr but my pay checks reflected 9.80 an hr Ik it's only 20 cents but every penny counts
bad,"Horrible manager, and just not a good place to work. I hated every bit of it. Wish I would’ve known something before applying. Worst job ever in my book."
bad,I worked there for 1 year 1/2 and it was so painful my boss was so mean to me it was a nightmare I was there trying to keep my job because I’m a single mother trying to provide for my kids
bad,"I was hired and within three weeks my assistant manager and manager had been fired. They promoted me to assistant manager but had no plan to train me at all. I was left at the store many times on my own even though they were aware that I had zero training. I worked 24 days without a day off and nine days without a lunch break.  On one occasion, I was told to be at the store at 6 AM so that I could use my key to unlock the door for an employee who would be there and then I could go home. This was Father’s Day morning, so I carried my son out of bed put him in the car and drove to work.open the door for an employee and be on my way. The night before, I asked my superiors if they were 100% positive that someone would be there, they assured me that they had confirmation. I get there a 5:45, and I sat there and no one showed up. 8 o’clock comes, it’s time to open the store and they told me I had to be there and open the store, even though I told him that my son who is disabled, is in the car. In so many words, they basically explained that I would be fired if I did not stay in that I could not leave the store. Worker is not showing up, and scheduling problems was a daily routine. I can’t tell you how many days I worked without a day off and how many days I worked over 10 hours without a lunch break. Also, I worked many hours overtime and to this day I have not been compensated. One day a bunch of corporate people started visiting stores in our area, that’s when they started firing a bunch of people. Then we had to sit through a bunch of meetings about unions and why unions are bad"
bad,This company sucks low wages and expect you to do your job and everyone elses worked here for 2 yrs not one raise not one promotion the store i worked at played favoritism manager was a jerk and a secest
bad,"The company does not care about their employees. What they do care about is money. They are the greediest company I have ever worked for and they think all vendors and employees are stealing from them all the time.I did not shop there before working there and I will not shop there after working there. Everything they sell is made in China and it is junk. It is really hard to find a healthy food item, the place is a junk food junkies dream."
bad,I work for DG in Colorado as a store manager and when I transferred to Houston everything fell apart. They expect you to do everything by yourself with no help from upper management. And when things go wrong they blame the manager but when things are going good they take credit for it.
bad,Don't do it! Store manager was an jerk and the asst. Manager and I was expected to do their job while they done nothing and got paid for it! Very stressful!! No work/life balance at all! For a full time key holder or shift manager they start you out at $10.00 And hour
bad,My experience at DG was not a good one. I was supposed to be learning and I wasn't included with conversation or training I should have been.  I left because I was told my job would not be held when I have a major surgery in July.
bad,Management and pay is horrible. They work you to death and barely pay over minimum wage. Manager doesn’t know her job and expects you to carry her and do your job plus hers.
bad,"The atmosphere there is pure negative. Manager treats you like garbage, hw makes you feel stupid. He also talks bad about customers quietly, I would never imagine doing that to a customer! Manager has a bad attitude as has drove several employees away and customers away. Would NOT recommend working there. I’m a positive person, always and it was a struggle to go to work because that place is way too negative."
bad,"Wish I could give a lower rating but I can. This was the worse place I have ever worked. Management always calling asking you to come in early and do extra duties, then get upset when you can’t get your normal work done."
bad,It is one of the worst places to work. Managers don't care if you get injured or are sick on the job. If you ask to leave because you need to go to the ER you will get fired and lied too about it.
bad,"Worked 75 straight days with no time off due to back inventory. Took the store from a one star to 5 star in three months and a lot of overtime , which I was salary."
bad,Dont apply for DG. Youll care too less or care too much either way it's not worth it because the pay is to low. You can't get over time you'll get called in on all your days off. You're asked to put behind your family needs to care for their needs and still not get anywhere with the company. Oh and the upper management stinks
bad,Became manager end of December no training until March. Literally worked open to close for almost 6 months with maybe 3 days off. Only paid for 40 hours but consistently worked 80-90 hours but was in no way compensated. There's no help ever when you need it and your left to figure out how to do everything on your own. As well as having to purchase supplies and not being reimbursed.
bad,I've been with the company for a year and asked for a promotion they gave it to me didn't give me a chance a it yanked it from me then I asked for it again and was told no when I work my butt off there. Went to corporate they haven't done anything about it. The manager yells at me for other peoples mistakes.
bad,Dollar General is an awful company to work for and the regional managers are some of the most cut throat people I've ever had to deal with. They have an insanely high turnover on all levels. The worst job I've ever had by far.
bad,"Do not miss the audits, constant cleaning, self management when I had zero authority to conduct my job, no control of A/C in summertime due to headquarters controlled thermostat. Hopefully the store is better than 2015."
bad,Managers were often talking on the phone to family or outside smoking. As a new hire was not informed on where to get schedules and schedule was made for a couple of days at a time.
bad,"They will work you, it is a stressful job. Sometimes you get 5 hours per week and they say it’s because of sales. Pay is very minimum. No pay raises and only one lunch every day. No paid breaks or any other kind of breaks. You will be stuck on the register. You are only allowed to ring items on the register."
bad,"The job was a nightmare. Worked in a building with half working A/C, broken doors, and horrible management. The job was horrific. None of the staff below me was trained, neither was the “store manager”! To top it all off nobody cared how understaffed, overworked, or how badly we we’re treated. Customers talked to everyone like garbage, management higher than me had no answers for anything. Don’t recommend this job to anyone, not even younger kids."
bad,My boss keyed my vehicle when I took a vacation that was intended for me and the company sited with her when she destroyed video surveillance of her doing it!!
bad,"I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. I started as a key holder which is a supervisor making minimum wage, and if you make 90 days you might get a raise, and the job is only part time. Good luck if you get full time."
bad,You will be given impossible tasks with unreal timelines for minimum wage. Upper management doesnt care and will make you feel inadequate. Pay is not enough for what you have to deal with.
bad,"I was with the company for 1 year and they don't care about their employees. They only care about what you can do for them. The management stinks with this company, they talk about the employee to other managers and to the other employees that you work with so everyone knows your business. I would not recommend this business to anyone because they have such a high turnover, because they don't know how to treat their customers or employees."
bad,Only thing I can say is customers are real nice.  Cashiers are expected to put stock up while running register.  Don't get hurt at Dollar General they will let you go.  I worked hard customer caused me to fall which broke my wrist. Manager said I could work the Cash Register if I wanted to work. Hard to do with 1 hand.
bad,Too much for one person to handle.  Need to hire more and pay more for the job requirements dollar general needs to care about there employees not the dollar they make
bad,Would never work there as long as same manger is there. But would work at a different store. Henryville store is nothing but drama.  Store mang.is ter
bad,Management was very rude and pushed me to quit my job. Theres was favoritism whih made it a horrible place to work due to only being a few employees..
bad,"I had to pay a fine out of my pocket for the company. This is the worst company I've ever worked for. Upper management is a joke. Store managers work 50+ hours a week, with 1 day off & are paid about $1-$2 more than an assistant manager on salary, which means no overtime pay. They throw people into positions without being trained & expect things to run smoothly. If they want to fire someone without a legitimate reason, they cut their hours until they quit. Rarely do they fire people, so the company doesn't have to pay unemployment."
bad,It isn't a flexible place if you have a family. This really is a stepping stone job. I was fired while my son was in the hospital having a major surgery.
bad,"My manager just based everything off of a computer, if you don’t agree with her then she would cut hours. "
bad,Dollar General is a sexist working environment if you are a woman you can do well. if you're a male you don't. If you're slow cuz you have some type of learning disability do not work for them you'll get fired because you're too slow. They harass you to try to get you to quit when they're the ones doing the wrong.
bad,I couldnt make it on the 20 hrs per week given they should offer more positions for full time and also the manager was flirty and .ade me very uncomfortable
bad,"Management actively prevented me from completing my job, thefts from the store were regular and i was written up by District Manager when i tried to push the issue about allowing people to steal from the store and company."
bad,"Dollar General has high standards and low pay. "
bad,"Worst company in existence, im truly amazed they havent been shut down. Management is awful"
bad,"Very rude training managers .. they don’t know how to train... harassing environment , there is a click if you don’t fit in you get harassing text dm does nothing about the situation nor does the corporate office."
bad,Manager not very professional complaining about employees on sales floor for customers and employees to hear played favorites with other employees this is why they have such a big turn over not enough employees you were expected to run register take care of customer do freight do the counter layouts straighten the store and was not aloud to use a bell for customers you had to watch and try to straighten at the same time you could be clear back in the store they need to get rid of the full time employees and start fresh and have the managers go to school in how to treat people
bad,Not a good work environment. They do not give annual pay raises like they are suppose to. Schedules are not posted in a timely manner and always short staffed.
bad,The DM don’t do what he should be doing and he let the store manager do what ever she want to do if someone call in and she have to pull Double she don’t have to work the next day and that’s part of her job being a store manager she don’t even work 50 hours a week she sits in the office all day or she out side smoking and on her phone she don’t recover the store and she barely help throw freight  and the store is a hot mess  the customers cant get down the isles because of merchandise every where the store is filthy and the DM knows what’s going on and he don’t   do anything about it and dollar General don’t care about the good employees they rather have someone in there not doing or knowing what they are doing and the stores look a hot mess both the DM and the store manager and the people in HR they all need to be fired doller General is not a good place to work for and then the pay is not good
bad,I love working at dollar General however I wasn’t treated well by the manager at the time he wouldn’t give me any hours and he even deleted time from my pay check once. I would love to to come back to work for the company now that he is no longer a manager
bad,"Terrible management, no benefits, no annual or yearly raises, inconsistent hours, shifts always changing. The management at Dollar General is horrible. Our store manager treated all of the employees awful, a lot of people quit or she would find petty faults to fire people. She would yell at her employees in front of customers. She would always threaten her employees that if they ever turned her in for bullying people that she would make their lives worse. Even if you did turn her in, corporate would not care. Dollar general as a company only promotes or gives people management jobs if they are bully's. "
bad,I was robbed at gun point then fired. The managers were stealing from the place and nothing was was done about it even after it was brought to attention. The managers left the store on clock and adjusted others hours to meet budget requirements.
bad,had to work off the clock very often. Very Stressful work environment. Had to work off the clock often during lunch breaks and sometimes didn't get a break cause manager was never given enough hours for the store so it put only one person at the store.
bad,The worst place I ever worked . Terrible working environment . Expect too much and pay nothing . Can't survive on the wages they pay . Outdated register system . Constantly breaking down .
bad,"A typical day at work includes doing returns for ""customers"" you are aware haven't actually purchased the items being returned but having no say in it (we do receipt-less returns, no questions asked), being demeaned for things way out of your control, being constantly pressed for time, struggling to complete tasks, customers who refuse to leave even when the store is closed, and, of course, performing four jobs at once: stocking, customer service, running register and managerial duties. Sometimes more than that."
bad,"Terrible management tactics. No set schedule, it just changes at random. Too much work too little time but wont get more people in to help. Managers will blame you for anything the district manager finds unacceptable. Just not worth the stress."
bad,"My work week: I was always scheduled 2 days off a week, but I was called in on those two days very often, there maybe a week where i didn't. when i told my manager that I wasn't able to come in, she would tell me i was un- reliable and that i always had ""excuses"". While I worked I was responsible for working the truck and completing stock. On Saturday I was responsible for Ad. I always completed my tasks. Long story short my Manager didn't care about how we felt she only cared about money and herself. i would not have anyone work for this location specifically. i was hurt the first week of work and i was supposed to have my medical bills taken care of by them and it wasnt."
bad,I was working here then all of a sudden i got nocked down to maybe 5 hours a week. The store stayed a mess. The manager is not a good manager. And they expect you to do a lot in a short amount of time. I do not recommend working here or for the company. The company itself sucks.
bad,"The place was an fun but the workers was not fun to work with, they would talk behind my back. The manger was friendly and always willing to help me when I needed help.."
bad,Worst place they will use you up and over work the good employees. People never stay long. The higher ups in management expected miracle that are impossible to achieve.
bad,They could do better training with employees.  give a bigger store budget  to allow more employees in so we can do what they ask of us in the time they allotted
bad,"I hate this job. Not going to sugar coat it, long hours and lots of them. Normally 12, 1, 2, 3, or 4. And work until close. Management sucks. There is never any planned days. This job is not good."
bad,"This company does not value anything or anybody but MONEY, they will bring in a good manager, tell them how much they value you and your work life balance, LIE!!! They put them in a store and will give them the hours they need to run the store easy. Then they start taking hours away and guess who get to work them. They will theaten the managers job if everything is not done, then when they are working open to close 7 days a week just to try to keep up, and they run them down till they can't go anymore, they push them out, and bring in someone else to ruin. STAY AWAY, or you will regret it!!!"
bad,After being told numerous times that I could move up in the job nothing ever came to fruition. In fact my hours were cut in half. I missed a lot of my children's school activities because I either couldn't take the days off or no one would cover the shift. I was kept at part time but worked full time hours all the time. I had so much overtime that even after working for three weeks at 18 hours per week I still averaged 40 hours per week.  The company as a whole doesn't care about about their employees or their venders. Venders go months without being paid. The store is infested with bats and we aren't allowed to shut the store down for our safety or that if our customers. I have had to catch and release two live bats from the store because the pest control agent refuses to work for them again because he had to hire a lawyer to be paid.  So yea not a good company to work for.
bad,Corporate management is a joke and they set up the employees for failure. Extremely high turnover rate because the only care about $$ rather than their employees.
bad,"no pay, backbreaking , unreasonable tasks....impossible for any person to do all that is required ...no shift coverage, and if you prove to be good in an area they expect you to do it all yourself, including unreasonable amounts of rolltainers and stocking while running register and assisting customers"
bad,"Working at Dollar General helped me to expand my skills in opens, and closes. I ran the cash register, made sure the store was stocked, and clean. Being a key holder I had the responsibility open, and close the store, count the money in the safe, and count drawers."
bad,"With 30 years of warehousing experience and some management, the warehouse supervisor that interviewed me denied me any employment due to my age. This company allows the practice of age discrimination."
bad,Stick around and you will be promoted because they cant keep people.  Not the worst job if you get a decent store manager but I wouldn't hold my breath. Little to no training and everyday they have a new rule to fire people. Benefits at store level are a joke and fair scheduling dosent happen unless your in tight with the store manager. I wouldn't waste my time here if I had it to do again.
bad,"It's for children looking for a summer job with no bills or respondsibility in life. Not an adult with car note, mortage and bills. You get maybe 17 hours a week if that."
bad,Never plan on working there again. They treated me like  and took advantage of me. Make me working one day even though I was vomiting in the bathroom.
bad,"This is a absolute terrible place to work. They treat there temps like they are dirt on the bottom of their shoe , even though you do the same exact job as the hire ons. Hr will terminate you for going to them with an issue with a manager , they believe everything a manager says. They won’t you to hit 100% production everyday even with the line being down for hours and some of the managers won’t deduct that from your production time and write you up."
bad,The dollar general I worked at was very understaffed and was an overall unprofessional environment who gave newcomers an unreasonable amount of work while the rest of the staff did practically nothing.
bad,"I was a store manager for dg. Won't lie I loved it at first. Problem is there isn't any hours and they expect the store manager to stay 24/7 to ""get the job done"". If your in the cool crowd with the company, as in your district manager/store manager then your good. Once you speak up or about a problem they get rid of you. I ran the highest comping store in Ma and I did it good with a great team. When I witnessed another manager and district manager didnt like someone and set them up to lose their job, I spoke up. Not even a week later they had a plan in place to get me out the door for speaking up. They felt if I was gone, nothing would be known. I went above and beyond to put this company on blast throughout corporate and everywhere else. I was relieved to not work here anymore but I did love my team and felt bad for them having to deal with the favoritism. alot of them witnessed it and also left. Awful company to work for. Very unprofessional,  they use people up and get them out quick. They dont like someone they will have the store manager cut your hours down to 0-4 hours a week because they know people cannot live that way and will eventually quit. Then no unemployment will have to be paid. Very shady company all together. For the task they ask all alone and the pay they pay no wonder they are always looking for people. I wouldn't recommend anyone to dg. Oh and alot of managers leave their employees without anyone else there for hours and hours, which then thos person cannot move from front or take a break. It's very unfair and unprofessional"
bad,"Dollar General does not value its employees, and requires management to work upwards of 70 hours per week although that is not stated at any point.  Shoplifting is rampant."
bad,Low pay to those who are great workers. Almost worked a year there but left due to unforeseen circumstances .management  is unprofessional. Will work you like a slave (literally).i worked for 20 days straight which is basically 3 weeks.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. My experience with them was Outrageous. The hours weren’t worth a shift of going. They played favoritism. And they were racist . Both managers. !!!! It was disgusting.
bad,"Do not work for this company! It's the closet job to being a slave! You are a body not a person! Operation is horrible, no organization.do not work here."
bad,The whole concept of the company's culture is a lie...How can you say your helping customers to be able to afford food and other things when you pay associates 7 25 or 7.75 an hour....
bad,Horrible place to work. I felt discriminated agaist was stollen from by employee. Did  not report theft that occurred.  Treated unfairly. Promised hours when first hired on. They were untrue. Was bullied when first hired on my managers. Un organized and dirty. With Mice poo all over food and merchandise food etc.
bad,"Hoorible management, to much drama between coworkers, one week you would be overworked the next week you barley had hours. No matter how dedicated to the company you are they will find a reason to terminate you as soon as someone doesnt like you, most who get fired dont even get told they are fired instead they end up removed from the schedule for a couple weeks until they decide to quit calling to see if they have hours therefore its marked down that they quit when reality is managment fired them was just to chicken to tell them because many are fired for no reason what so ever."
bad,"No pros to this company. No worknlife balance no hours, no help. Upper managment does not care to help you. Store manger always working on register or working 15 hours days. I would not recommend this company."
bad,Hostel work environment and poor management. Although I was assistant manager and in training for manager the current manager did everything she could to keep from moving up.. working conditions very stressful. Under different management the job might of actually been great.
bad,too many bugs chase me every night. i'm the fourth key carrier and that's pt.  somehow pt to my new manager means 30+ hours a week. it's a terrible place and the dm doesn't care about the employees. just the store. the new manager in training doesn't care either and was hand picked by the dm. i close every night and regret everything about this job
bad,"I hated this job. 8.25 to work my butt off and watch the managers laugh and play with their phone or boyfriend. Everyone has their groups so it was not team orientated at ALL! Then they lied and said I don't do my job correctly bc they didn't know how else to fire me! I have proof I did my job every dang day. I wouldn't recommend to anyone!!! And they ALL talk behind your back. Ugh so childish and I was the youngest one there! I work there for a year, worst year of my life"
bad,"I thought working with Dollar General was a great idea!! After working with them, I WAS WRONG!!! Im constantly got mistreated and no one was patient with me because i do not know where everything was and also no one taught me where items were!! The coworkers were having a argument with me and as usual i got the blame for it and got released from my duties!! they also knew i was autistic and thats the MAIN reason why i was let got!! BECAUSE I WAS AUTISTIC!! WHAT KIND OF A SICK PERSON WOULD FIRE SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITIES!! I never went back in there after that!! I refused to go!! I was so so so happy to move away from Hayesville!! I would never have to go back again!!"
bad,They dont care about the employees it is strickly about the dollar for them.  they will work you to the bone.  they dont want to give hours to the stores for cashiers and stockers and want the managers to do everything.  if the task are not done its the managers fault even though the manager has to stock selves work register and do paperwork and set planagrams all by themselves sense they wont provide the hrs needed to have addition employees for this.
bad,If you want managers that discuss your personal business with everybody in town and constantly be written up for things the manager is more guilty of then this place is perfect for ya.
bad,Strongly agree that this company is a load of trash!!If you worked for this company than you understand the pun on strongly agree! I killed myself for this company for 3yrs only to be “let go” for no good reason. I spent nearly 80 hrs a week worked for 14 weeks straight without a day off to meet impossible deadlines in a store that had been neglected for yrs! A store that mind u with the help of my loyal crew we managed to bring back to life and make sure all customer needs were met with smiles on our faces! This company is a joke they are the worst form of greed you will ever witness and the only ones who benefit are upper management dm’s and above! SMH!!!
bad,They talked a big game to get you in there after about four months you'll find out what that company is truly about there is no advocacy at the store level everybody above store managers is only out to protect their paycheck I personally was working 70 to 80 hours a week and every week the Labor budget got smaller and smaller and their expectations got higher and higher it was completely unrealistic and unachievable. Do not work for this company. The only good I saw in that company was my district manager she actually cared
bad,"They over worked me, went through managers like crazy. The last manager treci was the worst she was full of drama, lied about her employees, was barely there made everyone pick up her slack then she ended up firing everyone just because she felt like it"
bad,Definitely didn't pay what you should for how much work they make you do. Management is horrible and some are crooked. Drama up the butt like high school! Absolutely horrible. Don't waste your time applying!
bad,This job was horrible the entire six years I worked for the company. They do not pay people enough in any role you may have here. Management is awful and prejudice in the Lafayette area.They need to teach their management people skills.
bad,I was fired because I didn't want to come in and work on my scheduled day off and come to find out it was because the manager wanted me to work her shift for her and I'm not even management.
bad,Work load is strenous they only wont to b work you to death stocking heavy merchandise all shift and cashiering. Coworkers atitudes and the thought of getting robbed
bad,"High turn over rate. District managers and Store managers come and go.... Always ""active"" store managers that are really assistant manager s months at a time. Do not promote within the company. Concerns and communication is lost when talking to upper management. Ideas are not recommended nor thought about from veterans that has been with the company for years with lower status positions."
bad,"The management was completely unorganized and inappropriate toward the employees at my facility. I reported my manager for multiple issues to the area manager and never even received a callback or response. When your regular customers are being yelled at by the management team, and tell you how grateful they are you are the one checking them out, your first week in, that's a red flag. They have a revolving door for a reason."
bad,The Dollar General is a terrible work environment. The company does not care about its employees and it is constantly in search of new worker because the management can not hold employees.
bad,Safety or  health and well being. Company policies are not followed by all managers. They pic and choose which ones they want to enforce. Managers don't have good communication skills. Unfair in giving hours to employees.  Show favoritism to certain employees. Would never work for them again. I know now why they can't keep good employees.
bad,"If you're a single parent, this isn’t the place to work. Especially if you run the store. I had to work open to close every day for almost 2 months. They don’t care about your personal life just the business."
bad,"Terrible management above store level. You have no life. Work 70-90 hours with no compensation but normal 40 hour/week salary. District manager treats other stores managers differently- holds some to highest standards while others are run down dumps. There is never a bit of gratitude, never one bit of recognition. If you want to be worked to death treated like total garbage then thrown away for being loyal, work here because they will never change."
bad,If you plan to work 50-60 hours a week and store managers dont get overtime pay then this job is for you. Upper management will treat you like a piece of dirt and stress you life out and work you to death
bad,"Made 8.50 an hr for a manager position."
bad,Work over 60 hrs a week and get no appreciation or equipment to effectively run a business. Worst retail job I ever had. Do not work for this company. Glad I left when I could. They will not give you any help even though they always say if you need help just ask.
bad,"awful scheduling bad environment no morale management played favorites and often made sexist remarks as i was the only male who worked at said location, management was very rude and would cuss you out in front of staff and customers"
bad,They expected me to be on call 364 days a year.  You are required to scan every item in 3 seconds or less.  Your written up if the drawer is < or greater than $1.99.  No discounts for anyting.  Manager had women's rest room permanently shut down for women staff only.
bad,"Horrible place to work, some employees were allowed to bully, intimidate, and harass me with absolute nothing done about it by the supervisor. Employees were allowed to smoke e-cigs inside the building, smoke cigarettes right outside the automatic front doors and not follow dress code. In my 18 years working experience this was the worst place I had ever worked in my life. I was only looking to go to work a couple days a week, just to get out of the house since my son was in school now but so was not worth the verbal abuse I had to incur while doing so!"
bad,Terrible company all the men in management cheat on there wives with the young women they hire. Hands down worst company in the United States. Over worked under paid also
bad,"The upper management does not notice anything you do. For example perfect attendance or your hard work. They only recognize mistakes that are made. I worked there 12 1/2 years only to find out they don't care. If you are one of their favorites you can get away with anything and recognized for everything. The supervisors and management are very unprofessional. It was hard for me at first to  not work there anymore because I thought I was important to the company, but when I realized I was just a number, not being employed there was the best thing that ever happened to me."
bad,"Work environment sucks regardless of the store you work in, the amount of employees the company budgets for every week cant keep up with customer demands and the stores are always a disaster because of it."
bad,"Fast paced,. Rude customers, lazy co workers. Too much stuff in store to keep organized. Rules keep changing. No break if work less than 5.5 hours. New employees do not receive adequate training."
bad,No work life balance no payroll to cover your store and all that needs to be done. 60 plus hours a week with no help because dg does not want to pay employees enough so they will stay with dg so you can build a good team to succeed.  Would not recommend this company and i am in process of getting another job after many years being a dg manager.
bad,"It’s too much work for only 8 a hour, the only good thing is you get paid to weekly but they barely give you hours, and you can never call in even if you’re sick and have a doctors excuse. They expect you to come in even if it’s your day off, STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Was hired as an assistant manager full time and was put as a sales associate part time position. Store manager promised me 30 hours a week and was scheduled for a lot less. Worked an 8 hour shift and only got a half hour break. According to the policy an 8 hour shift was an hour break. Everything sounded good to get me in the door, but the truth came out at the end."
bad,The manager keeps cutting my hours down. i only work two days a week now. and she has written me up twice and keeps getting on to me for stupid stuff.
bad,"Wages are too low, work ethics are poor, as well as the work environment.  Only certain members of the ""team"" actually do the work required while others skate along with no consequences.  DG does not allow enough work hours for staff to actually get things done, and most often there is only one person working at a time.  New hires get to choose their availability, while others are forced to work every weekend.   "
bad,So a key holder was fired for Homeland security reasons. And I felt like I was ready for the key holder position. So I asked for it. My hiring manager said that I got the promotion. Didn't give me my keys yet or start training me for it. She got that co-worker back. And she bumped me down to cashier again even though he had been known to make major mistakes. It was given back to the other Co worker. So I told corporate about it. And 2 days after I was told they would look into it my manager started treating me worse. She through Easter candy at me and would yell at me for no reason in front of customers. Even made me cry in front of customers.
bad,It was the worst ever. Managers are condescending lazy. All they do is dictate then go sit on they behinds  or leave you in the store by yourself.....
bad,"Was told that I'd be working 4 10hr days and was working 5 12hr days after my first week. Had a supervisor actually tell me to only use the bathroom on my breaks. Horrible culture, horrible environment, horrible management."
bad,"Dollar general is a joke to work for. Little staff, ridiculous expectations. They wanted 1 key golder and 1 cashier to run the store at night when we were busy all the time. Pay is horrible. Management sucks."
bad,"I was terminated because my ASM had an affair with my spouse and I had words with her outside of work,  once the affair had ended because my spouse wanted to come home she took a statement I made to corporate and claimed that I threated her. The company clearly didn't care about the trouble she had caused my family and simply wanted the situation to go away so I was terminated."
bad,"Did not like working there. As busy as they can be, you have no time to stock. It was a pleasure greeting customer's as they come in. Breaks was short. Cleaning the bathroom after customers was nasty."
bad,To work for DG you got to be on your last leg!  I mean you have to be desperate for a job because this company don't care about they're employees! I had hours stolen from me...the turnover is horrible!  And if the manager don't wanna work they don't have too. I enjoyed working with customers but I just couldn't do it and that environment....it's too toxic!
bad,"Managers have unrealistic expectations for everyone except themselves and the district manager has a "" God complex"" and is uncaring about the REAL issues in the day to day running of the store. Plenty of osha and safety issues are ignored. No wonder employee moral is in the toilet and there is a constant employee turnover!"
bad,"Bad management, very stressful.  Starts at the corporate level and trickles down.  Bad place to work.  Not enough hours, work expectation exceeds amount of hours given.  Untrustworthy environment."
bad,I would not recommend this job at all. Most the customers are very rude and the workers are lazy and stand around at night. The store is always a mess anytime I go there.
bad,They are the worst company the work you like a dog and the don’t care about there employees they are horrible with customer service and management is the worse person in that store
bad,"I've been working for DG for a little over a year. I've worked at two different stores. Both stores the management was complete and utter bullcrap. "
bad,"I worked for dollar general for a few months the pay was $7.25 and the work was more like a $10.00 hour job because everyone did not pitch in and do their own jobs and the manager was never there and when she was she sat on her tail in her office and did nothing and was rude to customers, she is no longer with the company."
bad,Bad staff and they don't care what is happening with you if you are sick you still have to be at work. They don't care about you at all its about the money and nothing else.
bad,"I was worked Beyond my ability pushed into a store manager position with no training and wrongfully accused of theft then as a customer two years or more later because of an employees suspicion...I was searched m"
bad,"I am not afraid of work but as a store manager the hours were impossible.  Staying till 11 some nights back at 6am the next morning, being in the store alone for hours at a time, 90 to 100 hour work weeks.  It was bad.  My children never saw me."
bad,The person I was working under was sexist and rude. He would show me how to do something one way today and then the next day tell me I'm wrong and then show me a whole other way. Sometimes he would say rude things that made me uncomfortable. In all I hated the whole experience.
bad,"I was very short lived here, thrown into a store where the back room was over filled with product from years past. Promised a crew to clean it up ""before"" I started in my store. Never happened.They work their managers more than any employee, They tell you that basically it is a 48 hr position with 1 day a week off, But with no attendance policy the employees just don't show up and your left to cover the extra hours."
bad,"Really bad management , lack of leadership and a lot of favoritism . I started as a order selector now I’m a replacement driver and I know how to do a lots of tasks"
bad,"I had to wark hard and prove myself to get the full time sales lead position.  Once they holidays were over, they cut my hours, then proceeded to demote me, dropping my pay and cutting my hours more.  Their reason was corporate didn't want that many full time sales leads.  Also someone hit my car, in their parking lot, while i was working causing $2000.00 in damage.  Dollar General  refused to do anything about it."
bad,"One thing I liked about working at Dollar General is that most of the staff were pretty cool to work with (not all of them). But I still hated working there. The pay, of course, is very low. It might be good for a summer job, but not something that you would want to depend upon as a career. The hours are also odd if you're only working part time (I believe only the managers get full time). If you're lucky, you might get 30 hours one week and then you'll get as low as 12 hours another week. I was getting odd shifts too. I would have to come in at 6 in the evening and leave at 10 at night, then I would have to come right to work at 7 in the morning or so the next day. I just don't understand the way they do these shifts. "
bad,"Hated working there. Terrible manager. Too much favoritism.  No advancement unless someone quits. Have to work register, stock, & clean, recover, set sales. No employee discount."
bad,had to have good customer service skills-work was easy but demanding. schedule was flexible. customers were nice. received merchandise from delivery truck.
bad,Management played favorites and did not care to much about all employees. Treated employees like the were disposable even though employees are you should never treat your employees like that.
bad,I was a cashier and sometimes stocking I loved my job only thing I didn’t like was I didn’t get paid until a month later it’s a very clean store and has no problem
bad,Very unprofessional. Got treated badly and talked bad about constantly. We would get our hours cut short randomly with no notice or reason. Would maybe be decent for someone just looking for an extra 4-8 hours a week.
bad,"Dollar General is a fast growing company. However, a portion of its profit comes from the overworking of the store management, and paying them far below what they deserve."
bad,It's the worst place to work at dollar general baxley ga store#10944 keyholders don't want to help cashier when we have a backup line all they want to do is go back and forth outside smoking cigarettes.thats not fair and will work you off the clock.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at the Oneonta NY Dollar General. The management here Is rude to both customers and employees. She believes in work before school and is constantly giving others attitude. The hours available to work is poor, somehow the store was always over hours but manager always wanted your availability to be more open and when it was she would say there was no hours. The store is dirty and over crowded and not handicap accessible and should be fixed immediately."
bad,"I have no positive affirmations to give about this company.  Management is disorganized, pay is poor, CEO is greedy, stores are dirty and understaffed, product is routinely out of stock.  Managers are overworked.  I went through three managers in the eight months I worked here."
bad,"Worked most days by myself in the store, for a least 6 hours. Due to the lack of hours for payroll. Worked a minimum of 55 hours a week, had to normally work open to close due to call outs and no shows. Had zero district manager support, as he was to busy kissing butt of upper management. I have worked in management for over 20 years, with big box companies and this is the worst job I have ever had. Company is wanting to continue to add new stores and could careless about it's employees and customers. If you have any other options for a job, I advise to take it and stay away from the so called company."
bad,Dollar General is a company that does not support the community or their employees. There are several stores in my area that have requested certain things or help from the DM and RDM to make sure that the stores are up to code and adequately staffed to ensure that the community needs are met and nothing has been done.  The company fire the good employees and allow the bad employees to ruin a great company
bad,I love what I do but the company doe not have good direction. They give policies that they do not enforce. They are building stores on top of each other and want the store to have a sales gain. They pay store managers salary (40 hours a week) and want them to work 50+ hours.
bad,My manager was lazy and mean to customers and he didn't wanna hire the needed help because he wanted to get bonuses. I didn't like working for him. I loved my co-workers.
bad,Worse place to work.  Manager was racist and treated ppl unfair. She played favoritism and was stealing from the store. She would damage things just so she could eat or drink it
bad,"Depending on your location and manger you will either have a great experince or a horrible one please dont not be"
bad,"The interviewer was very unprofessional and the interview lasted maybe 5 minutes. Once I began working there the management staff began to show just how little they cared about the company. I reported theft, by the front end manager, to the store manager several times and it was never addressed."
bad,"The only thing good I can say is majority of customers where friendly. DG is an awful place to work! You are not appreciated at all. The management help each other not you. Can't put in for days off you can't even trade. Benefits, forget it. If you get any the insurance is sky high and from pay and hours, there's no way you can afford it! It's ridiculous!! I've worked in customer service in some form for over 20 yearsand this place was by far the worst! Seriously!!"
bad,"Underpaid with a lot of duties, the environment isn't healthy. Crabs in a barrel mentality. The store manager didn't know what he was doing and didn't want help from other leads and managers who were there before he got hired which makes doing the job even more difficult."
bad,The managers were rude and didn’t help with anything. My manager treated me like dirt. The assistant wasn’t much better. They also lied to me about what my hours would be. They promised me 25 and put me down to 12 and 14 because they didn’t like me. Childish.
bad,I had a lot of people coming in the store with a friendly attitude. Also love the people I work with and the atmosphere is good and it’s worth the trip
bad,"This is not a payroll job it is a call center, with  no team work or upheld standards. If you are looking for work life balance you will not find it here, looking for a team environment not here. If you want to be cussed out by retail employees with no support from management, this is the right place for you."
bad,"I did not like this job at all, I was lied too about the work schedule and I would not recommend it. You never get to know your managers nor do you ever have a chance for advancement."
bad,they don understand that people have bill to pay you can beg and beg for hours but all stores are the same non are willing to give you more no matter how hard you work
bad,"No one should ever work for this company.  They will work you to death and not pay you for it.  I worked there for several years and was never given any respect for the work I did.  I went from store to store trying to improve each one, which I did, but never received a bonus or even acknowledgement for my efforts."
bad,"Dollar General Corporation sucks in general, doesn’t matter what store you go to. of course there is exceptions , but i’ve yet to come across one. "
bad,My time at the dollar general in lousisna was the worst possible experience I have ever dealt with. The management was immature and belittling. The manager made it her duty to message me inappropriate things often when I couldnt come into work. She often times would single me out and others as well as a 'test's.
bad,"This jobs was horrible. mangement was worthless, very spiteful i called in one time over the 4 months i worked there so she dropped me down to 5 hours a week. Then when i went to find a new job she lied about me when the called for a reference. Got screamed at by another employee because i wouldnt let him cut in front of a customer in line. Just and overall bad place to work. Not enough money for what they want from you. I did alot more than what was in my job description."
bad,"i worked there a few months and felt and was treated like a child. do not work here if u have a family. they claim they are a family oriented business, but its not what so ever. they want you to make them priorityover anything else. the store should be your life."
bad,Not enough pay for the workload they put on people. Cashiers have to run register stock and recover all at the same time. the job duties are unending and expectations are high.
bad,"It is worse than walmart with how it treats its employees. GM is always overworked to the point of breaking, they work 100 hours a week on 40 hour salary and I wish that was a joke. Place is always disgusting nothing is ever fixed and all the DMs care about is lining their own pockets and saving payroll. Never work here"
bad,Poor managment. random schedules. alot of thefts by employees that got blamed on the wrong employee. inapropriate relationships. allowing thefts all the time
bad,Just dont expect to make this a career job just go in so your job and go home do go over and beyond because there not they act like they dont even appreciate there workers
bad,"the management only wanted to hire people she knew. When I originally interviewed with them I let her know what my situation was & she hired me under the understanding she understood what was going on and could work with my schedule. That was not true I was having to cover the Store Managers shift because she would leave to go ""run eerands"" at the time I was not key holder just SA."
bad,This is not the company to ever work for. They DO NOT look out for their employees. They overwork you and the pay absolutely sucks. A high-schooler  couldn’t live off that income even with basic bills. Dollars General should be ashamed of themselves. This company has the money to open up a lot of unnecessary stores but wont upgrade the pay so their employees have enough to make a decent living. Disgusting
bad,Well working here was a bad idea because i need to move to pensacola and i’m i’m about to be homeless. i don’t get paid enough to get my own place so now i need a GREAT paying job.
bad,"Dollar General may be a great place for someone who is just beginning to come into the workforce but for those who are not new to it or want to make a career it is not."
bad,"When I first started hours went in between 25-35+ a week as part time. Then later on the just kept getting lower and lower as everyone else got more and more hours. It got to the point the store manager wanted to retrain me and wouldn't give me more hours till then and they took a week long vacation leaving me out of work for a week and a half. When our new ""crew"" came in after half of them quit or got fired our customers were complaining about them being rude and unresponsive towards them when they were simply greeting or asking a question."
bad,"I gave almost ten years to Dollar General. I knew my jod inside and out. better than some district managers. and they knew it. that is why i was their go to person to fix their district stores. and that's what i did. and that's what i wanted to do. i wanted to travel. and then i wanted my own store. the store my mom ran. she and i were the ONLY successful managers that were able to keep that store clean, stocked, and in successful running order. oh and staffed. i was promised that store on three different occasions. and was lied to every single time. until they hired someone from outside the company. someone who never worked retail. someone who didn't know anything about dollar general policies, or procedures. I had to train him before going off to DG Academy. That was a slap in the face. to have to train the manager of the store that i was promised and i wanted. only for him to only last a few months. not only was that a waste in money on training him and sending him to dg academy, but all could have been avoided had they promoted from within. i wanted to climb that corporate ladder. i wanted so badly to be in corporate standing. but because i don't have a piece of paper from a college saying i know how to do the job, i wasn't considered. even though numbers don't lie. and my numbers where ALWAYS where they were supposed to be. every store i took over and fixed, their numbers went up. that's why i was the go to person. why wouldn't a company want someone like that to help make ALL their stores succeed. someone who worked the stores. who ran the floor, threw truck, done inventory,"
bad,This company is very unorganized and requirement is for most even cashier to original the job. This is not a great working company. Min wage and no advancement with pay but tones of work.
bad,"This job had too many complications that I couldn't wrap my head around, so I had to get out of there while I could. It was too draining for a high school student."
bad,"To much drama , bad managment, low pay, suspicious enviroment and bugs were terrible! There was roaches and pests all throughout the store. Racist staff"
bad,"I really don't want to get into the politic of Dollar General. It is a place that will steal your soul and make an old person of you before your time.  They don't care about you as a person, just about making money with as little cost as possible."
bad,Worst management possibly asked for. Worked 3-4 weeks in a row with NO off day. Worked to the point of miscarriage and manager refused to let me off work.
bad,I really feel like the company doesn't care enough about it's employees well being. Which is upsetting seeing as I gave this company some of my best years.
bad,"Save yourself the stress and do not work here. Management was awful. They gave an unreasonable amount of time for one person to get tasks that would take 3 people to do. The store manager changed the schedule almost everyday to accommodate themselves, not caring about the employees. Never got a day off. Worked like a dog and would still get yelled at. Asked the DM for help and they laughed. Sorriest excuse for a company."
bad,"do not work here, EVER!!!! the job is stressful and underappreciated, you have to deal with jerks as customers, and the management has no idea what they are doing."
bad,"Management feels its okay to yell at workers in front of customers. "
bad,"Horrible, do not ever try to work at the location off of Shawnee Drive in Kansas City, KS. The management doesn't care about the store associates and the upper management expect the store to be ran understaffed and over worked."
bad,WORST job ever. The management is horrible and doesn’t care for their employees. Gives the worst hours ever. The manager would give herself all the hours and have employees work once a week for 4 hours. Super stressful and it’s not worth a dime. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"Dollar General sucks the life out of you. I worked for this company for 2 years as a GM. I was one of the better performing managers in the disctrict and was still treated like garbage. I worked 70 hours a week but was told I was only require to work 55 hours a week. With the payroll/labor budget my store received weekly, guess who didn’t get to go home when the payroll hours were up. Me. I would not work for this company again if my life depended on it."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. Nothing was ever enough, they always wanted more. My short days were 12 hours . There is no work life balance."
bad,"I thought working at Dollar General would be a fun way for me to make a little extra money being that it was so close to home. However I quickly learned that it is in fact one of the worst employers that I have ever had. There is zero training at least not at the location I was hired at. The store is a constant mess, poor communication from management and terrible pay compensation. I felt like I was thrown to the wolves often left alone at the cash register with little to know knowledge on how to operate it. This place has a huge turnover of people and I can see why."
bad,"worked as a cashier. my boss spent most of her time outside smoking and placing her responsibilities on everyone else and when we were experiencing storms here in cullman, we were advised that we were not even allowed to go iinto the restroom for protection"
bad,Stressful underpaid job work many many hours a week not enough family time after work 6 days a week 12 hrs a day  mandatory for all store managers alone most of the time they do not provide enough hrs for stores to have 2 people at all times making it difficult to do ur tasks daily
bad,Would not recommend this place. Pay is low and hours are horrible.dm was never available. They talk alot about helping managers. You are left on your own.
bad,"I was only getting a little over $7 an hour and expected to go, go go. If no customers are at the register you MUST be stocking merchandise. You are expected to do both without EVER making a customer wait at the register. Seemed a little unrealistic."
bad,stressful place to work. have to be able to work 10 plus hours and be able to multitask.The bosses are not supportive and you have to be able to do things yourself. no good befefits
bad,Staff was demanding of things they didn't do when I worked there they made me do things that were not done when I got there and wanted me to do them. Wound't work with that company again
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. No respect for the individual. The goals were absolutely unfair. You managed a nonexistent team. You were the team. You work trucks, manage the front, run the register, and clean the store.....all at the same time."
bad,Unless you can put up with complete disrespect and your schedule changed only hours before your already scheduled shift. Do not work for this company.
bad,"If you want to work for terrible management, this job is for you.  If you want to be treated like dirt, this job is for you.  "
bad,They pay you nothing for a stressful job. The customer's treat you like garbage and the company doesn't care. They want you to stay with the company and advance but refuse to pay anyone a decent wage.
bad,a typical work say is that you stay at work all day no breaks and have to runs shifts and employees don't come in to work shifts. No holidays off at all.
bad,I loved to work there until we got new manager. he is not a good manager at all. my look at he should not be a manager. he never did any thing. he never touched truck.. one day he fell asleep in his car for three hours.
bad,Had to work at 4 different stores to get my full time hours. Corporate blames product loss on employees rather than theft by customers. Two employees expected to run store during peak hours.
bad,"it was a very slow job, could get a lot done when customers were not needing cashed out. some coworkers talked too much about personal lives. it was boring"
bad,"When I first joined the team it was great, they brought in a new manager and immediately the store went downhill. Constant complaints from the customers about the overall condition of the store. Upper management are bullies. The pay is minimum wage, even with 30 years experience. The lazy ones are promoted, while the hard workers are told they all have attitude problems. Simply not a good place to work at all."
bad,No money and they give your hours to the ppl higher up in the chain or for ppl that suck up to managers never enough hours and they tell you hours will go up but never do
bad,"When I worked at Dollar General, I was hired on at minimum wage, told we're paid less to ""keep our prices low"", and that I could save up to buy a car while I was there. Save up to buy a car when I can hardly afford to pay bills? They got jokes. Management was terrible, I worked at a large store that never had more than two people on hand at a time, and only one manager(out of three, mind you) ever made time to help customers or answer questions new associates might have had. All I got from Dollar General was hip problems and some bad jokes. Working 7+ hours on my own, with one thirty minute break? On minimum wage? No thanks. Step your game up."
bad,I hated this job. 8.25 to work my butt off and watch the managers laugh and play with their phone or boyfriend. Everyone has their groups so it was not team orientated at ALL! Then they lied and said I don't do my job correctly bc they didn't know how else to fire me! I have proof I did my job every dang day. I wouldn't recommend to anyone!!! And they ALL talk behind your back. Ugh so childish and I was the youngest one there!
bad,dollar general acts like they care about their employees but they really dont. They lie and they are racist. they will take one manger from one store and put the assistant they want to working at the the store with them. They will give you a position just to pull it from you
bad,Horrible management... I was hired as a full time lead and without notice they dropped me to part time.Horrible company to work for.No communication.. I wouldn't tell anyone to go there to work
bad,ITS NOT WORTH IT. it was a waste of my time I did more work then the assistant store manager she was always smoking or using the restroom and then they were 5 months behind on inventory when they hired me
bad,"I worked as a manager for Dollar General for 5 years. 70+ work weeks not good enough. Bosses are bullies who sit in their car on the phone all day on conference calls thinking of ways to make you work longer hours. The money is not worth it. , the work life balance is terrible,  Most of the customers are rude and dirty, not enough hours in the day. The managers work freight all day.  If you want to know why all Dollar Generals are filthy, go to work there. Every week they send you the same plastic junk  that fills your backroom until you end up throwing it all in the dumpster, just for them to send you more plastic junk that no one wants.  Terrible company."
bad,"Here's my experience working at Dollar General:"
bad,"I wouldn't suggest anyone to work here honestly. The franchise is ran poorly, they don't respect or praise their hard workers, and they don't pay you no where near what they should, or what you deserve. Honestly. "
bad,"Dollar General is not the place to work at. You barely get trained at all. Then you would think that getting hired in as a assistant Manager,  I would learn the main stuff I needed to know that didn’t happen. Training employees to there job is their biggest failure. The Regional Manager told me that himself out of his mouth. So think about it."
bad,This is one of the quickest firing jobs I have ever seen.  They will literally fire you if they don't like you.  New management came into my store where I was Asst. Manager for 1 year and fired everybody.  Claimed they wanted fresh crew.
bad,This is the worst company to work for.  They use you all up and spit you out. I would never tell anyone to work for this company.  Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad
bad,"When I first started I loved it, then my managers true colors came out. It was not a very fair place to work, complaints are payed off in gift cards to keep customers quiet and happy. Corporate doesn't care about employee complaints. "
bad,"wages are too low to be able to provide for your family.  Work hours are good, but cannot get enough hours per week to make a decent pay.  No paid days off. no health insurance."
bad,"My opinion of Dollar General will not be positive.  They work extremely short handed all the time. The pay is at best, mediocre.  Their hours are long, both physically and emotionally draining. I was left alone in the store at night for more than 4-5 hours, Cashiering, stocking, accepting trucks and left unprotected.  This is one place I would never go back to."
bad,"Worst company ive ever worked for. I never got my yearly raise, i was forced to work off the clock, i was force to go to the bank unpaid, i was force to attend unpaid meetings. I got hurt on the job & it wasn't reported, i waited over a month to go to the doctor because i worked 6 days a week and never had time, my left leg and back is messed up bc of this accident, two days later i was fired for using 5 off 25 coupons for customers."
bad,My experience with this company was awful. Management was unprofessional and disrespectful. Discussed personal employee information with other employees.
bad,"When you interview, things seem reasonable, but the upper management turns on a dime, then tells you that what you are questioning was never said. That is the behavior of s narcissist, this happened over and over. Not structure and horrible communication. They also wanted you to work on your break, that is illegal. Sorry to say some of my co-workers feel trapped and put up with it, it's sad."
bad,"Your availability doesn't mean anything to them, they schedule you for whenever they want. Most stores don't properly train new employees. They also can transfer you to any other store and you either have to comply or quit. Absolutely unprofessional."
bad,"Overworked to the point of doing 150 plus hours per week. Yes, that's correct 150 plus hours a week. Burned out stressed out and told to work more hours than I was already giving as a store manager"
bad,They lie to you and sell you a dream on how it's such a great place to work. They say how their production rate is easily attainable without working to hard. It's all lies to get you in the door to move product. Over the summer a guy in case pick fell over and split his head because of exhaustion. When I say you have to work HARD I mean the hardest you've ever had to work. In case pick you're expected to work like an animal for an entire shift. They dont care if you can hardly get out of bed at the end of the week. I knew when someone said turnover is 80% at most of their DCs there was a reason.Then we were told that if we weren't sweating we weren't working hard enough lol  They've ran thru so many employees since its opened they are having hiring events and have raised the pay nearly $3hr. Accept a job in case pick and you'll see for yourself.
bad,"Poorly run company, Turn over is high. Always under staffed and managers work over 60+ hours per week to cut back on labor. Stores a dirty and not maintain."
bad,"Days consisted of other employees being rude to you when you came in, schedule being changed without being told, unprofessional employees. Pay is extremely low."
bad,Manager was god awful who left anytime she wanted because she wanted to. Pay was not what I was promised and its not worth the work they want you to do.
bad,"dealing with customers"
bad,if you not an butt kisser than you not going to get far in the company. I never understood for the life of me why we got trucks every week when we barely sold things from the last truck the week before. Management is horrible and the schedule was ridiculous. I had to be at the store 5 or 6 hrs alone before the next person came to release me. The manager still expected whatever task you were assigned to me done before you leave. They just expected too much out of one  person. The store is full with rolltainers on every end of an aisle because it no room in the stock room to out them. The other employees were rude and no respect for other people in upper management....
bad,"This was hands down the worsr company I have worked for. Employees were berated by management on a constant basis, we were expected to work 12 hour days and then turn around and switch to a shift immediately after you had gotten off allowing for no sleep. If you couldn’t make it in for legitimate reasons you were either taken off schedule or written up. The schedule was never set."
bad,If you don't want to go to school and be a busy be-- Then Dollat General is the right place got you. The management didn't really work on schedual and the co-workers are the worst people ever.
bad,"The manager there when I started there was so unprofessional, talking about people, and would also lie on people it was so wrong of her what she did. But the manager after her was cool."
bad,.first it was my greatest joy working  at Dollar general but after this manager was a major gossiping woman it was really sad... She hired all women and turned each one of us against one another.and she paid me way less then each person there with out experience I have a great deal of experience in that field I was paid 8.35
bad,"Maybe its just the town to blame for how poorly this store was kept, but poor management had a lot to do with it as well, underpaid and over worked for the pay received"
bad,I would not recommend nor would I ever return to Dollar General as an employee they do not treat you fair they overwork you they discriminate the general managers and the corporate managers are very disorganized and not very understanding you don't feel comfortable going to management with your problems. There were not enough hours and they underpaid you.
bad,RUN !!  Do not work for Dollar General!  Management constantly demands more productivity.  You can NEVER accomplish their goals and are therefore in a negative working atmosphere constantly. Upper Management always puts unrealistic demands on our Manager.  There is NO WAY we can fulfill their expectations!!
bad,Management was horrible. Too many hours not enough pay. Business is not ran right. They don't care about their employees...............................
bad,"The work environment started out good then it changed quick. I put a lot of hours in for others and never got recognition. Not a good place to work, I wouldn't reccomend it."
bad,Typical day consisted of constantly trying to push freight because your stockroom is always impacted.  This company wants you to wear too many hats.  You're HR/cashier/security/stocker...Never enough payroll to support the workload. Most stores are in bad shape.
bad,worst job I ever had. you only make minimum wage but they work you to death. I had bad management as well as no support from the district manager. bad job
bad,"This company doesn't care about the workers. I did all the work an someone else took credit for the work i did. They show favoritism, and basically its about who you know instead of what you know."
bad,Terrible  place to work they terminate you  over the  phone and put not for  rehire  in your  file it doesn't matter how hard you work never do enough work ALWAYS going to be written up instead you get  terminated over the phone.
bad,I did all the managers duties consistently on a daily basis and she got paid to do nothing. When asked to transfer they deny it and when you complain it’s all your fault. Management sucks and don’t care about you at all. Hard work and no recognition what so ever. Worst place ever to work. The only thing I learned was once you are in management you can do whatever you want with no consequences to your actions.
bad,"My experience and time at Dollar General was horrible. This is a company that has expectations that are far beyond was is capable of accomplishing. They over work their employees, assigning them to 20-30 job responsibilities in a single job shift."
bad,The management was very poor the employees were very rude the customers were rude everyone was very very rude blaming me for stuff accusing me of money thrift when I was off work that day. The overall company was very rude
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for in my life! They don't care about how many hours the manager works or how few associates  you have in the store. Allowed to be robbed at gun point and expected to keep the associate at work without any counseling at all.
bad,i would not recommend anyone here . My experience with this company was beyond horrible. Not to mention all the robberies! do not work for this place !
bad,Bad job to work don’t get pay enough management the only person who get 25hours or more 7 dollars it’s nothing to be payed for cashier and stocking and u have to do both with 20 hours or less a week
bad,"I worked at DG for 4 months before being promoted to store Manager in a brand new store.  I did have years of experience with a similar company. However there were many differences in how they operated. My training was laughable. I was pretty much thrown in and left to figure it out on my own. My only saving grace was a good friend who had his own store as well.  My DM was of little help when I had questions or problems.  He very rarely came by the store, would promise to do this or that and never followed through.  So of course there were issues getting freight out etc.  I had all brand new people working for me that all had to be trained. For the first month I worked open to close and would take naps in my car from exhaustion. One year later  I’m told they are moving me(they asked but it wasn’t really a choice) to another store. And it was an awful mess. I spent 6 months cleaning up this store that had been allowed to fall apart. My first few weeks there we dumped 10 carts of outdated food. I lasted another 6 months, getting lots of customer compliments and out of the blue I get fired for something ridiculous. It’s all politics and who you know. If your DM has a buddy needing a job , watch your back cause you end up without a job."
bad,"Very low pay ."
bad,"Very inconsistent with rules and management acted like children. One day something was okay the next day it wasnt, management were friends and all they did was gossip about everyone and put them down."
bad,"the management never get back with you when they say they will."
bad,"I worked as a STM for two years.  At the end of the day you are a glorified stocker, or cashier. The company has unrealistic expectations for store standards with the amount of Labor Hours they give,  Even being a certified trainer (15 extra hours) The company will call you a trainer but the likeliness of you being compensated is slim to none. DG makes every excuse not to compensate you for training other Store Manager's. They don’t take care of the stores appearance, trying to get a bathroom, or light fixture repaired is like pulling teeth.  It’s a vicious circle, if your not part of the “click” management will pick and choose what managers need to follow certain rules. Each manager has a different set of standards instead of being fair for everyone. "
bad,I initially enjoyed working here but after being there now for four years I still make below ten dollars. There isn’t much room for advancement in the company
bad,"Management was undertrained and over worked. The higher ups did not care for anyone on the floor at all. Unrealistic expectations and every single day was a chore. If you need a job between jobs this is fine, but don't stay for more than a month or two. They are all really cruel."
bad,"lot of hours little pay, very stressful, work was fast paced, manger was not very good. lunch breaks were very short if any, rarely got other breaks unless you smoked."
bad,"I would not really recommend working for Dollar General in Beaumont. I am not sure about other places, the manager before did not keep her promises as far as me being promoted."
bad,"No stability in management at DM and RM level.  No quality of life for Store Managers.  Difficult to hire quality people due to lack of wages for hourly employees,"
bad,The company doesn’t care about their employees. It’s only about the money. If you last longer than 4 years they look for any reason to fire you bc they don’t want to pay your salary when they can fire you and hire someone and pay them way less. More work than 2 people can ever do in a shift.
bad,"Overall the job was horrible, I don’t recommend no one to work there they slave you for $9.00 and you have to beg for a raise. Management was never at the store so a lot of call in and I literally had some one come up to me at gun point for a gift card scam"
bad,This place ruins peoples health and relationships. They work you like crazy and give you no help. I could not take take off when I had a miscarriage and I don't need that.
bad,"Because I was treated poorly by the store manager and the district manager. I prefer not to put anything else in this review. I loved what I was doing, but it's hard to keep a positive attitude when the store manager was horrible and didn't care. they have an open door policy that if you can get through would be a good thing. I could never get through. Their digital coupons very rarely worked, favoritism, work policy not enforced for most employees."
bad,The management doesn't care about anybody but themselves. I would have to work every single weekend all weekend. I would be left alone 5+ hours when I breastfeed and have to pump every 2-3 hours.
bad,N/A not a job you would want to work for. They really don't care about you. You can work your butt off and they don't care as long as the job is done on time.
bad,This was my first job and it made it so that I cringe at the thought of ever working behind a register again. My boss was unprofessional not only to staff but to the customers as well. I felt that we were understaffed and all of us staff were underappreciated by the higher ups.
bad,Dollar General was an okay place to work. I enjoyed working with people daily. Sometimes there would be irate customers. It was a fun environment to work in.
bad,It could be the location I was in but this was by far the worst job ive had. As a manager you work yourself to death on Salary. You are not allow hours to keep the store properly ran or stocked.
bad,"I thought no company could be worse than Walmart,however, I was wrong. Dollar General is the worst job I’ve ever had. They make the store managers work 50-70 hours a week and they only get paid for 40 hours. The store managers have one day off and the district manager will make you go in on that one day off, consistently. You do not get ANY time to enjoy your family or yourself. They don’t pay their hourly associates enough money but expect them to do a lot of work. They only pay assistant managers $10 an hour but they have just as much responsibility as the store manager. Also, with the amount of hours they give the store, the manager on duty could be in the store by themselves for about 6 hours before the next person comes in so that leaves you no room to take a break, eat, or anything else. They do not give any of the managers an uninterrupted lunch per the law because the manager can not leave the cashier by themselves so most time they have to work on their lunch break."
bad,The manager was rude to every employee. she would tell you how to do something a certain way and you do exactly like she said and then five minutes later she is yelling at you for doing it wrong. That was the first job that manager gave me a panic attack.
bad,"Store was horribly understaffed but still sent employees to cover at different stores. On several occasions I was asked to cover at another store after working 8 hours. Most shifts were only one cashier and one manager, with the manager impossible to find and many register functions locked. I would be called in and not allowed to refuse. Was still made to come in even when I had the flu."
bad,"10/10 would not recommend working here. The hours are horrible, the pay is even worse. The managers aren't very friendly. You're expected to do too much without being paid nearly enough."
bad,"The manager use to fight with all her employees and constantly screamed in our faces. There was often nobody over 21 present to sell alcohol so she forced us minors to sell it. She made us managers and we worked constantly. Sometimes from opening to closing with a few breaks and just 1 lunch. She often made us clock out so she wouldn't get in trouble and told us that she would pay us for the shift by ""overriding"" the system so she didn't get in trouble. We didn't get paid overtime either. The employees use to hide products on sale so the customers couldn't buy them and wait til they were 90% off and purchase them for themselves. She would let the smokers go outside as they pleased to smoke right next to the door while customers entered. We also got promised raises and never actually received them,"
bad,Little to no training and employees have no say in their hours or their schedule. They are quick to make promises and they are rarely kept. I was lied to about the bereavement leave when my grandfather died. You can get someone to cover your shift and bring a doctors note and still be threatened with termination. You can literally leave in an ambulance and you’ll most likely get fired.
bad,multitask how to stock product. poor management. in the few months i was there we had four mangers and they were fired for stealing money. friendly. dealing with unsatisfied customers. stocking product and meeting new people.
bad,"The manger and district manger sucks. They treat their employers poorly.They are threatened by good employees. They over work you and make you do a lot, give you little time to do it or they dont pay you for it. they dont care about the customers needs or wants. NO Teamwork."
bad,the management was the worst. as a new employee I should have had a higher up over my shoulder or near by at all times. I got left alone multiple times with a large line. had terrible breaks.
bad,Management couldn't keep employees in the store. only one or two non management workers. Had no regard for employees well being. Management harassed me the day after car accident and handled scheduling poorly afterward.
bad,"I worked at DG for 1.5years under the same manager. She was extremely unprofessional and petty. She hired her daughter even, right under the district manager's nose. The worst parts were when she'd schedule us by ourselves at the busiest parts of the day, which led to high theft and long lines with one register, and tons of stuff to do. The work wasn't too hard and the people were great most days. If management was different it may have been a wonderful place to work."
bad,"This place could be better if management wasn't so poor. We never know what hours we get. They change more consistently than the turn over rate. I work random ours or whenever I'm needed and it's a nusciance if I cant work. Overall, a poor place for adults looking for a Job. It's like a high school play area. Horrible pay for the work and not enough hours to matter."
bad,"The manager acted like she only had care about the store when the general manager came in. She had no order In the store and couldn't control her employees. The Assistant Manager talked however around customers including sexually and that made customers talk to employees sexually. the pay wasn't livable at all, even with a promotion."
bad,"Dollar General will find a way to get rid of an employee they no longer want or like. They will cut your hours , be mean to you and turn others agains you so that they can pressure you to quit."
bad,"Do not work here. This company will try its best to kill you. They will put so much on you to do in one day it is impossible to finish. Most of the locations are so dirty because the company refuses to pay what is needed in payroll to keep the store clean, shelves stocked and enough cashiers to keep the lines moving."
bad,"Lousy workplace, no benefits, Very bad Mgmt. No communication, no contact when youre supposed to work. No communication from Manager. Lots of drug use at the store. CEO's shouldenforce mandatory drug testing b4 and after hiring. Lotsa thefy of store property covered up by Manager."
bad,stressful no family life to much gossip and drama broken promises have their favors is not worth the pay work you like a slave the hardest place i have ever worked for
bad,"it was close to home. convienent, had to help unload the truck, help to do returns, cash out store in the evening, prepare the deposit for the next day."
bad,"it was  difficult place to work. The managers seem as if they would rather find things wrong rather than help you do your job better."
bad,"Very stressful expected to do the work of 12 people with only 4.  Very hard to cover working hours, Manager has to do all of it, from unloading the truck, stocking, merchandising the floor, register.  To much for one person."
bad,"Would not recommend.  Poor management, with unattainable work standards and zero respect sympathy or help  from the upper echelon.  Favoritism was wide spread and the company doesn’t follow the Kentucky state required labor laws for break times.  If you’re a key holder you have to work during your lunch break. Terrible all the way around"
bad,This is a sorry place to work for. Would not recomend no one to this company. The dm stressed u out and critisizes you on everything. She makes you feel like you are nothing even if you pull a store from the ground she still makes you feel like nothing
bad,I loved the work I did. I just didn't like the upper management always out for themselves and always trying to blame someone else for their short comings.
bad,"You have no work life balance what so ever. Mandatory 6 day work week, plus on call to cover any shifts that come up. Dollar General prides itself for being a low cost operator, which means the manager covers any and all shifts or extra work due to increased freight or call ins. Most district managers speak to you in a demeaning and belittling manor in an attempt to intimidate you into conforming. In the event that it does not work the constant threatening of your job should do the trick. Severe lack of advancement opportunity as they have put a hold on promoting store managers going to the next level for the next few years so they can bring ""new"" ideas into the company."
bad,Not a way of life! Long hours & Does not pay enough for the hard work put  in. Mandatory overtime. District manager is not hands on. Not enough payroll to complete task & help customers! Sometime store managers are left in stores working alone for 5 or more hours
bad,This company let us go 2 weeks without heat they let people go if you get hurt there there a scummy compony tbh everything is alaways a mess they compony has no idea on hkw to order anything. It like ya lets order 20 plus of the same products
bad,Poor management inconsistent hours lack of employee motivation and rude managers always under staffed and unrealistic work load just a all around hard place to work for
bad,I loved the work but Dollar General was just a greedy company. They are so greedy that they want their store mangers to run the whole store by theirself during shifts plus do everything else. They will always have a high turn over until they start caring about their employees. I will never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,Dollar general is not a good work place they are to busy on there phones to know anything about the store are rude to customers dislike very much will never work there again in my life
bad,Worst company to work for. You are often in there by yourself. You are forced to do 10 things at once for little pay. They dont dont believe in change.
bad,"Overall, this is an easy job as store manager. The toughest part is finding reliable hardworking  employees that will work for little money.  All stores never receive enough payroll to get everything done that needs to be done in a week, and district manager will tell all stores to cut payroll on top of the little hours that are given. There are plenty of times when there is only 1 person in the store at a time,  which is very unsafe, and most stores are put in low income locations. Store manager is salary,  so you can work between 48 to 60 or more hours a week."
bad,"The manager at the Canon,GA. store is a female dog,starts with the letter b.."
bad,"It's ok to work there but you will have some difficult customers a time or two. We as a team are supposed to talk to each other & let us know what we're doing for the day or what's been done but there's no communication. The store manager is always walking around the store on her phone & if she's having a bad day she will take it out on them. She knit picks at everything I do & then threatens to write me up for things I haven't even done. I've been there 3 yrs & I have great CS skills but now I feel I can't be myself anymore & that disturbs me because I used to make them feel very comfortable & I would always have a smile on my face. The store is always a mess & there's so much to do with only 2 people on one shift. Cashier runs register, stocks, cleans area, helps customers, recovers which means pulling everything forward, putting go backs away, getting ice from outside & propane exchanges all while you have a line of customers. You have to stop what you're doing to ring people up. The store is so out of order & I never know what's going on. Carts everywhere, theft is so high & you can't say anything to them accept not to come back. We need security guards but they won't hire any. The other employees are great to work with but I feel if you don't work on your day off the store manager takes it out on you. I do have a life outside of work. They expect you to clone yourself & have all your doubles doing everything at once. There's boxes laying everywhere so customers can't get to certain products. We need more dependable employees to want to work & a better store manager that"
bad,I worked for the store for six months and was not happy with the way the store was run. Cashiers did everything while management to smoke breaks and socialized with customers.
bad,horrible upper management horrible location  horrible hours  horrible attitudes horrible policies  horrible horrible horrible horrible place to work altogether
bad,I hate workinng there they are horrible they donot care abouth there empoly an they are unprofessional they need too be close down the mangere are horrinle they donot kn who to talk to custom they are the worst store they never have nothing
bad,I never worked there got hired as assistant manager and quite my job then the never called me or nothing just acted like they never even hired me I would never recommend this job to no one
bad,Dollar General requires their managers work 6 days a week. They ensure that this in the case by limiting the hours available for hourly employees. All employees other than the manager are considered part time.
bad,Really the worst place to every work!!!! Manger wants you to do a million jobs at one time plus you’re getting paid below minimum wage it’s not worth it.  Manger is really rude.  JUST the worst place to work in the Williamston area. Only worked there because I needed a job at the time.
bad,"the manger is not there, lacks workers, pay is too low for all the work they want, you get paid weekly is the only pro if you need pocket cash. run way with you soul intact."
bad,"Dollar General does not care about employees or their families. If you were sick, you were still expected to show up. If someone didnt show up, you had to stay. You have to juggle the register, office work, and stocking and recovering. You were only allowed 48 hours to get a whole truck put out in the store. However, customers come first."
bad,"After nearly 11 yrs of dedicated service, no write ups, never late or called out, an assistant manager for 11 yrs, I was set up by customers who wanted me gone including a couple of associates who were close with the customers. They called and complained about me saying I had said racist remarks when in fact I NEVER did! When it came time to hear my side of the story, they didn't bother to  investigate the probability that this was actually a set up and I was terminated on the spot, no unemployment, no food stamps, NOTHING and they held my 401 K hostage for nearly 2 months!  Because of the false accusations I was denied benefits, and am not able to find another job because of this. They literally ruined my character,and I talked to lawyers and there isn't anything I can do unless I have a witness to testify they were in the wrong and had planned this false accusation."
bad,"This company does not hire people onto fulltime unless they are a part of the management staff. Employees are expected to work part time with a schedule that is continually changing from week to week. They have absolutely no loyalty to their employees but expect the employee to be completely loyal to the company. They provide unsafe work conditions and expect way too much of everyone but especially management. In AZ they expect the manager who is salary to work anywhere from 50 to 70 hours a week and do not provide payment for working over the 45 hours required in verbal contract, and they get away with this because salary employees do not clock in or out. Rest periods and meal breaks are not provided for salary employees either. If you desperately need a job I would recommend but continue looking else where so you can work for a company that appreciates employees services and provides loyalty in return of loyalty."
bad,"I was over worked and underpaid and under poor management. It wasn't the right career path and  I only took the position in order to pay bills. I desire with more job security, benefits, and good workplace chemistry."
bad,Does not give opportunity to move up in the store instead brought someone from another store in. Manager was not a good manager didn’t go by store policy
bad,Is all about company. They told me company first then family also too much micromanaging. They want u there from opening till close and constantly calling or texting you. U have no life with this company at all.
bad,"Dollar General promotes gross mismanagement, messiness, greed, and poor working conditions for employees. Management often is corrupt and malign. Do not work here."
bad,"This company always talked about team effort and meetings, but they never seemed to show those skills, nor did they make effort for team meetings. They singled people out and made them feel like they weren't enough, and in my whole employment I never knew about benefits until I left the company."
bad,Dollar general was a nice place to work but as far as the manager and employees they were not organized and pretty rude I only got 4 hours a week which was nothing when u have a family to feed
bad,"Not safe working environment , no hours can’t keep a manager that actually cares about working there. The theft rate is through the roof and uncontrollable"
bad,"I was a GM worked several months without a day off. The one time I went to the ER on my day off, because I had a bad ear infection I received several phone calls from the district manager saying someone called off and I  had to go to work even though I had a dr note for 2 days off because my balance was off and I was vomiting. By the time you add up how many hrs you are working when you are salary it is about $4. When you finally find good employees and train them the district manager will give them a raise and move them to another store so you are constantly short staffed. Its a joke"
bad,"the big guys think they can come in at ANY given time and look at the store, and tell you if its not perfect by tomorrow you lose your job. absolutely horrible management."
bad,The hours are horrible   No good pay.   And is not possible  for all the work   They want done  This company    Is only about make  they revenues  they don’t care about  The  safety of workers and customers   That why the  store look   Horrible   Two work can’t do all the work and half of the time they both of them are on the  register   Because they always   Business  And some manager have to work  by himself for  two or threes hours to make  Labor    And  corporate don’t care    And the work that have good pay. They Let them go to save on Payroll   And pay a new manager  Half of what they where  make.   That what  type of company   This is .
bad,"All anyone at the corporate level of this company cares about is money, the way customers are treated is disgusting. Most of the store managers don't seem to know what they're doing at all. There is so much drama with employees, it's ridiculous. You can ask to have a specific day off at least two weeks ahead of time, for an appointment or prior engagement and will most likely still be scheduled for that day and then get told that ""you never told"" your manager. The environment is so hostile, I wanted to quit after my first couple of months and I would have, had I not needed the money. I would not recommend working for this company to my worst enemy. It's despicable."
bad,"Manager unaprochable told to just listen dont talk promised hours then hours cut Always had negative notes to come to work and see"
bad,As a store manager I was required to work many weeks without a day off by the district manager. Usually 10-16 hour days on top of that. All that hard work and long hours for such little pay!
bad,Dollar General doesn't care about it's employees. The lowest my mental health has been in the last 5 years was during the time I was at Dollar General. I plead that you please consider working somewhere else.
bad,Management were bullies and  showed a great deal of favoritism. For part time employees the hours were never guaranteed 10 hours to 40 hours. Requesting anytime off was a joke.
bad,"The cashiers are expected to do the job of 4 people while the managers usually sat around doing next to nothing. The tasks themselves would not be an issue if there were more than one cashier at any given time, but the cashiers are frequently on the register for most of the shift while still being expected to finish all of the required tasks and be out of the store by 15 minutes after closing time. There were also times when customers would be allowed come in after closing, and the cashiers would be required to help them and still try to be out by the 15 minute mark. If it's a choice between working there or walking over hot coals, walk over the hot coals."
bad,"This job was great in the beginning, but management was messy and the pay is low. Hours are hit or miss. My biggest thing was management was never on the same page, confidential information became public knowledge to all employees."
bad,"It was very rare for me to get days off, and the company did not show any respect or care for it's employees in the years that I've worked there. When bringing problems to higher management, you are basically told to get over it."
bad,"The store was not set up with room to walk down isles, the management was poorly trained. The employees were not friendly when I worked there I was getting complaints all the time about other employees."
bad,I would never recommend someone to work there. Everything about the job was disappointing. There was not much to enjoy while working there.It's a 0/10 from me.
bad,"i was left to open the store by myself and run the store without any help for up to four to eight hours at a time. it made it hard to get my work that needed to be done. often times people didn't show up for work leaving me at the store for longer. checking in vendors for product deliveries, stocking merchandise,.....  was not able to leave the store for lunches if i even got a lunch."
bad,"The amount of work and the poor management on every level make this an awful place to work you will be underpaid and overworked and the work environment is hostile with managers who do not want to do their work and when they have to they'll blame you for it, you also dont get full time hours ever and that's a problem."
bad,I had to work six days a week and at times I was the only person in the store because you had to make payroll. The company wanted the manager to do all the tasking and stocking of merchandise which in turn causes burn out.
bad,"The pay sucks, the hours suck, no benefits. This place would be great for a kid that's in school and want to make a few bucks! This is not a great working environment for an adult with bills, and looking for career advancement or benefits."
bad,Store management don't care and HR don't care so don't even bother. Very low pay rate. No room for advancement. Dirty place to work. Hardly ever stocked.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anybody to work at Dollar general in Paducah Kentucky by tilghman high School it was to many activities going on at that store...
bad,"Company has no cares about their workers, do not offer sick days, hours are constantly changed without letting you know. Most Management doesn't care about you or any emergencies that may arise in your personal life."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here if you have a family. I needed only mornings but no one is allowed just mornings. I barely got to see my child from where I was working non stop. Some days I had to come in at 6 am when I'm only paid $7 an hour. So I do not recommend working here .
bad,"You are required to do everything. Cashier, stock the shelves, and clean. If the place is not clean or stocked by a certain time you would lose hours and then they still expect you to get this stuff all done. Then, if it kept happening then you lost more hours. People barely had hours to work on and others had to close the store...ALONE! But they don't care about that because you are the one liable if anything happens."
bad,You can't live off of 7.25 an hour and bust your butt for basically nothing . Very stressful when I worked there .I liked the team but then everything changed . People leave.
bad,"The place was ran like a mad house. Nobody knew who was in charge the manager was hardly ever there, nothing but problems with who wanted to try telling people what to do."
bad,Management was always worried about something else. Always talked down to employees and customers.  Never showed appreciation for anything done. Very negative atmosphere
bad,I spent tireless days at this job they have no respect for their employees they hired me as a manager at Dollar general i made 8.50 as a manager just 50 cents more than a cashier I was forced to work on the store alone on more than one occasion I had late employees they we're told I had no authority then I was fired because one of my coworkers ahold 6 hrs late to work and cursed me out
bad,Management was soo bad. The first two weeks working there was great and then it went out of control! Asked me to come into work still the same night I was in a car accident!!
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"Company does not care or respect lower level employees, including store managers.  HR is hard to reach when you have a problem and then extremely slow to action.  Over the course of a few months, our district had almost a dozen store managers fired for one DM’s dishonesty which trickled down to the lower level employees.  Everyone was set up to fail and then wrongfully fired for doing nothing wrong, right before Christmas. Their computer systems show that changes are made by the store, so when an upper level employee makes changes no one can tell who did it so if you’re DM is shaving time to make it appear that they are making budget - you’ll be the one in trouble and fired for it without hesitation, without fault. Everyone had the same story and yet they still fired everyone he was doing this to.  That is a recipe for failure and again, shows how little they care about their employees as a company.  They don’t provide managers an opportunity to grow or succeed doing this, so it’s a lost cause and not worth the stress of the job.    With as much as they require managers to work (48 hours plus), you bring home about $10/hr when the week is done and have little help.  Not compensated well for the hard work put in. Little to no job security."
bad,The managers at the dollar general I worked at have all been winners. Not really though. One tried stealing thousands and blaming the employees and the other insults his employees.
bad,"-	Planned store layout and budgeting of all marketing materials."
bad,"team work was never a good essential role at the Dollar General, there were always long lines, and when customers had complaints that were needing management involvement, it was beyond  difficult to locate management, due to not able to leave the front end of the store"
bad,"The company is very stressful. They have only one associate in the store at the time and expect for that associate to care for customers as well as put out freight. Dollar General will leave an associate in the store after dark alone, knowing that there is no one else there, when they have short scheduled the schedule or the scheduled associate called off."
bad,They let the customers talk to you any kind of way like call you out of your name and try to fight with you if you don't give them the price they want.
bad,Lack of hours lack of personnel the expectations are too high no support but I still did my job and I was there for three years until I had a personal matter and you was not allowed to take off too much time
bad,"Store manager doesn't communicate with employees in a professional manner. When store is short handed the store manager is suppose to pick up that open shift but does not, and allow employees to work night shift by themselves. They over work you for the small amount of pay, you have to remind them to give you your raise. They need to do better no one wants to work in the Pilot Point location due to the store manager and how corporate treats their employees"
bad,"I worked long hours,was called in to work on my scheduled days off,attended mandatory meetings without pay on my days off,never received any recognition for going above and beyond my work duties,got paid very little. This is the worst job I've ever had."
bad,From top to bottom worst place ever to work. Had 5 managers quit so they kept me as temp store manager made me work 90 hours weekly and refused to help me
bad,haven't given opportunists for advancement got laid off because of one error didn't educate me on what i did wrong . would never work for this company again
bad,"dollar general is full of dreams being sold. Nothing came out to what they ""sold"" me to join the company. Was told I would be in training for 2 weeks. Its been 6 months and no training in the role that was being given to me"
bad,"The manager would call in and just scream at you for insignificant little things. She had her favorite customers who would get unwarranted discounts and freebies, and if we didn't give them their stuff, she'd call us and scream. She'd also just come in to stand in the door and scream at the employees, never helped with cleaning or stock, and would put us down for not being able to keep the store clean between 2 employees every night."
bad,i dont know why its making me do this i havent worked at dollar general in forever and when i worked there i hated it.. only worked there for like 3 weeks.
bad,"Supplies are never on time, restocking doesn't happen enough, and employees have an tendency to steal from the cash register, and other crimes within the store."
bad,Dollar General's management was very unprofessional.  They treated employees like classmates they did not like.  It felt like I was working in a kindergarten classroom.
bad,I started in high school it was ok but it continued to get worst the manager didn't like me for selfish reasons from the past with my parents I cannot disclose had me working 3 weeks without any off days worst experience of my life
bad,I learned to just work at work and don't make friends. I learned that not everybody cares about there work like they should. I learned to just focus on me and my work.
bad,"I feel like a slave, the company does not care bout its employees even though they try and act like they do but they don’t. They except way to much out of the store managers"
bad,I've been hired at Dollar General for two weeks now and I've only worked two day. The manager won't get back to me and she hasn't put me on the schedule.
bad,Don't get paid enough to deal with the amount of work and multitasking that the job requires and zero family time so it makes it frustrating when you work weekends and your family does not.
bad,"No training whatsoever. I was let go after only a couple of months of working there because I was not doing things right because I was NOT trained on what I was supposed to be doing. Management was also terrible. As I was talking to the corporate manager, the store manager was already pealing the letters off my name tag. I was never trained at all. Will never work for a Dollar General again."
bad,"I loved working as a manager in the begining of my job, however after about 6 months i began having to fill in for other stores because managers would quit. I was running 3 locations at one point and would have to drive 110 miles a day and was not paid for running the other stores. I also worked from 3am to 10pm 7 days a week and was not compensated for it."
bad,Upper management is the problem we need to start with them first let’s bring them out to the store and see there performance I’ll bet they couldn’t last a month in the company and they could really see what goes on and why they have a high turnover rate
bad,"Worst communication ever, sloppy management, no training, no breaks, no benefits. Treated like a thief bag checks every day when you leave. They foster an environment where everyone is looked at as a theif: managment is required to constantly review cctv but the amount of work they drop on you and lack of ability to schedule sufficient hours causes mangers to work 70+ hours a week"
bad,"A typical day at work would be that you clock-in with a till already I your drawer. Then whoever is MOD gives you your instructions. I learned that Dollar General is a company that doesn't value their employee's, they underpay employee's, and overwork employee's. Management is a disgrace, I feel that District Manager's need to look more into the Manager's they hire, because I have yet to meet one who is qualified for the job. The workplace was nothing but drama, and was full of childish, emotional adults. The customer's were very disrespectful and management doesn't do anything to backup their employee's. The hardest part about the job was going to it. Wasn't enjoyable at all."
bad,I want a different job because it's a bad place to work and it's unfair to its employees. They have no benefits. They pay unfairly. They dont give employees enough hours.
bad,the manager was hard to work with and she would always complain about everything other people did and would talk about people she fired and put their business out their on the floor.
bad,No training structure and management is very two faced. I would stay away if possible. They tell you one thing when you get hired and then they decide to do the opposite and make life terrible for you.
bad,the pay is bare min and very low hours its not even worth it you would barley make enough for gas money you would do better being homeless not really much else to say
bad,"Get more vacation time then most companies but hard to get the days off. Work all Holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas and your lucky to get those off. But no work life balance, claim to be family oriented but is not. Unrealistic expectations. Harass employees. A lot of favoritism. Managers spotted at hotels with subordinates. Lie to you about hours to get people hired. Hr very unhelpful.fail every health inspection they have had but manage not to get shut down. Unsafe equipment and when equipment is sent to maintenance to be repaired its returned to floor unfixed but employees are expected to work using it."
bad,"I didnt like working there. my grandfather died, and my niece was in the hospital and they wouldnt let me out, so i quite, and then a few weeks later they sent me a letter saying i was fired"
bad,Store seems to always be understaffed. Management does not care to work doubles so as other associates work them. Managers are required to work 6 days a week and 48 hours which if you have a family it means you have to choose family or a job.
bad,"After 3 years of working for Dollar General, I was let go due to an automobile accident that put me out of work for being ""undependable."" Over the past 3 years, I never missed a shift, and if I did I made sure it was covered, or had a doctors note putting me out of work. As a company, they are okay to work for. However, their employees are not as well treated as you may have been told."
bad,Management is invasive and rude and the other Employees are lazy and selfish the place is always a mess and a fire code Violation if you value your sanity dont try it
bad,just not a good place if you need to pay bills and feed anyone.. hours stink. favorites who do not work get hours and tattle on you about things you never even did but IF they are a favorite They are believed instead of going to the cameras.  I could swear right now just thinking about working there again- I did it 3 times! I swore the last time I would never go back and allow myself to be treated like dirt.
bad,"Managers only take care of themselves. Meaning they get the schedule and hours they want, and stick it to everyone else. They don't care if you have kids or school or a life. You are required to show up for their 4 hours a day schedule, or you will be threatened."
bad,the manager was unprofessional and wasn't much help. I didn't get a lot of training. Was left to be on my own only after 2 days of training. the manager would disappear a lot.
bad,"Dollar General was only a temporary job while I was in college. I worked in several different stores in and around Tyler, Texas. My first manager was awesome, unfortunately, he had  to relocate and become a manager at a different company. After that, my next manager was hardly ever at the store, did not work many hours, was not there when needed, and had a horrible attitude."
bad,"I did sort of enjoy my job at dollar general. It was a very interesting job, the managers expected way to much out of their employees when all we got was minimum wage. I enjoyed the customers and talking to them. I did not enjoy the managers, they expected us to do more then what we were fully capable of doing."
bad,"Find anonther place to work you will be much happier.  If you love working 60,70,80 hours a week and only paid for 40, Dollar General is the place for you."
bad,Worked as cashier checking customer out. Estimate of 50 to 60 plus customer a day. I handle money each day. Also help stock the shelves and clean the store.
bad,"hours for store managers are utterly ridiculous, there is a lack of assistance from upper management. the turnover is extremely high because the employees are over worked and under-paid. the needs of team members constantly go over looked,"
bad,This job at Dollar General is not worth the gas to go to. It has more cons and no pros. You have to do more and the pay is not worth the time of day. The managers are looking after themselves more than the employers to.
bad,"I worked at DG in 2009, and was going to school, at first the manager worked with me on my class schedule. I wasn't the only employee going to college. I became sick had to call off 3 days and was told management couldn't work with me on my upcoming school schedule."
bad,"I'm quite sure there's many locations that are well run by responsible and caring management and employees, but at the locations i worked at there's no such thing. The managers i worked for did not take their job seriously. Many times they both steeped out the manager role by speaking in a unnecessary way or actions that were acted out towards me. I've reported them to the district manger and nothing was never done. I was actually accused of lying when i told them and showed them hospital paperwork that I was diagnosed with the flu, From there I've had the store keys taken away from me and was never told why. Again, tried getting in contact with the district manger and explain whats going on and why is this happening, But of course nothing was resolved, It got to the point when i asked to be transferred to another location so i be away from drama that's happening in the workplace. What's funny is after i asked for a request to relocate,the next day I started to get disciplinary write ups from the store manager for things that were not instructed me to do as far as closing and was given to me by the assistant or closing manager for the shift. Another call to the DM and still no response or resolution. From There I couldn't deal anymore"
bad,Worse job I've ever had. I would never encourage anyone to go there.  They don't believe in hiring good people to help run the store. They expect 1 person to do everything that takes 4 people to do
bad,Run horrible place to work. If your thinking about working for Dg check out u tube. So many videos to see what it is like. My fav A day in the life of a DG employee.
bad,"Got hired at Dollar General and was promised 30 hours a week at 8.50 a hour,well it never happened !Got the 8.50 but not the hours. Every week my hours was less and less. The last week I worked i only got 14 hours. The next week schedule I only had one five hour day !! That's when I said to myself I need to find another job. You are over worked and under paid there. If I had to close which was most of the time I had to run register,zone the whole store,clean bathrooms,sweep and mop floors,clean counters,refill bags,empty trash,and put away returns plus stock !! They have a hard time keeping people. I wonder why ! Lol As far as shopping goes its great when you can get down the aile that is !!"
bad,I would not recommend this as a place for anyone to work at.  The upper management do not stand behind their employees and the hours you work are not consistent.
bad,Typical box company that only worries about getting their money and not worried about the welfare of the employees that they hire. Salary is not enough for the two people they have staffed a day.
bad,I really liked working for this company but I will not Recommend for employment. I was a 3rd Key Manager and was taking care of the whole store. I was there for about 5 months.
bad,There General manager makes and gives unrealistic expectations of the worker's. Only a two man crew at all times. Expected to do 5-10 people's jobs while doing your own.
bad,"The store manager was great but everyone up from there is horrible. The district manager was a smart alec and was horrible to work for. I was threatened many times and when I went to upper management they said "" where did you think you were coming to work at Macys"" so nothing was done to ensure my safety"
bad,Management is the worst I have ever worked with. There is zero structure to any aspect of the business. Constantly dealing with theft from employees and customers.
bad,Supervisors were not helpful or professional. Schedules were never accurate. Displayed favoritism and did not give raises/promotions to deserving workers.
bad,"A hard place to work. No job security. No set schedule. No set hours. Get called in n days off . One week 20 hours the next week, when people quit 40 hours"
bad,"Dollar General overall to me is a well keep job that someone like me could handle. Every day is a laid back day unless it's truck day or tasks need to be completed. The other employees I worked with were very friendly and on task which kept me that way as well. The hardest part of this job is kind of hard at Dollar General to me was probably recovery especially on truck day. It was ok until you get busy in the store. Overall, I really enjoy working as a sale associate."
bad,At Dollar general you are expected to do everything. It feels all at once. For rolltainers you have to have 1 per hour done and they are over crowded. 6 totes an hour and I can only do 2-3 an hour.
bad,They do not care about employee safety.  They allow the customer to steal and get mad if you report it.  They took up for a person who assaulted a employee and did not care when the guy came in the store on drugs with a gun who killed himself after walking out of the store per employee request for him to leave
bad,"I’ve been in retail many years and have never seen a compnay ran like this one.  Its crazy, working 70-80 hrs a week with no extra hours to help ease the burden of killing yourself every week.  There thought is...”we will just hire someone to replace you”. Then they won’t train that person either.  Haven’t seen my family in weeks except to say hi & buy, many end up divorced.  Its not worth the stress on you physically, or mentally. I am getting out asap!!"
bad,I stood on a man up lift and loaded cases of every thing the stores stocked onto pallets and placed them on the four different levels in mods. management would make you stay and work after your shift was over without warning. nothing about this job was enjoyable.
bad,if your working part-time and trying to do school as well then this is not a good fit. you work just shy of full time and get stressed out over everything
bad,There is retaliation!!  The District Manager could care less about your complaint.  High turn-over.  They keep horrible workers and do their utmost to get rid of the good worker because that good person doesn't fit in to their group.  I'm a great worker and filed a report and I went from working 38 hrs a week to 20 hrs. or less.  Horrible working conditions!!
bad,"While working it was the hardest thing and there was no support from cooperate or any of the higher offices. The workplace culture was fun cause we made it that way, but there was no overall support"
bad,"Management was not willing to work with me when my grandmother died and I needed to be off for her wake and funeral. At the end they were only giving me  hours per week, HOw is anyone supposed to live on 5 hours at minimum wage."
bad,"It was a job but it was t what I need the manager was not very nice, the hours were not good at all the work we did we didn’t get paid enough to do abc just the job it self was not good to work at."
bad,"Under Kendra’s reign (and I say it as reign because she’s like a dictatorship who is lazy and plays favorites) I was a manager who got 16 hours a week scheduled. She would call me and switched my hours with a little girl who’s her BFF so I was getting maybe 7-10 hours a week. When I worked with her she sat in the office all’s ay and did nothing. She didn’t know how to properly do drops, scheduling, and she knowingly let another co worker harass and slack off and cause issues in the store. She allowed her co workers to be put into a stressful work environment and make up for her and her other co workers laziness and hatefulness yet if you have to miss one day for a family emergency and contact her previously too that with plenty of time with a note from the incident your let go for complaining about the harassment. I have worked for this company for 6 months palmyra was great, French lick was not so great under sue but it was workable. And paoli was an absolutely horror . A 24 years old nightmare is running that store I would not suggest working there, I was a manager I made 9.25 cashiers made $10!!! It was unacceptable."
bad,"Management was horrible there, they always messed up the scedual. Never let you have time off. Always called me in when other ppl would call in sick or something. Working more hours then i was suppose to."
bad,"Typical day would be running the cashier all day, inbetween that I would be stocking products. I learned how to run a register. The management sucks, some co-workers are helpful. Hardest part of the job is being expected to stock a certain amount while trying to run the register, then afterwards having to clean bathrooms and mop the store. Most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and helping them receive a semi good experience."
bad,"A company I would never work for again! Poor management, pay and environment!! Stressful and full of drama!! Can't afford benefits because you can't get enough hours. Hours are never consistent!!"
bad,This honestly was a terrible place to work. We were completely over worked and under paid. The company has no room for advancement and when you need a certain time off they tell you no. But then take that day off.
bad,It's can be better they need pay there worker betters and when u say u are full time get full time hours and be fair bout how to do the hours don't stick one people all on night and the weekend only
bad,"other employees tried to talk stuff behind eachothers back, company policy says if you dont stock x amount of stuff per hour you get written up and possibly fired even if you are the assigned register associate who is busy checking out customers during busy hours...  your time serving customers is viewed as time wated even if running register by the management and they only care how much you stock."
bad,my managers were not good at their jobs. always made us do their work while they sat in the back office. lots of stealing happens at dollar general and they do not try to help it at all. very lazy management
bad,They have went through over 600 employees . In 1 year.  Human resources knows nothing. Unless your kissing butt to the Managers you will get NO WHERE.
bad,I feel like there should be more pay and hours for this job because they expect you to do all of this work plus extra in order to help make the store look presentable but one person can't do it along and the store can't be managed if there is poor management with that being said customers come into the store and the only people they see are the cashiers no managers in sight unless we page them on the phone base to come to the front of the store even if customers needs assistance from them. I really need a new career in my life because Dollar General isn't enough for me.
bad,Horrible treatment of store managers.  Never enough labor hours provided to effectively run a store.  District Managers dont care about you or your well being
bad,I do not have much to say. I was not trained very well. There is a base pay for positions. They do not consider your experience for your hourly wage. They tell you many things and none of it happens. They also give Sales more hours then there Key holders when you have open hours. They schedule you at night when you wanted days and was told you would get it
bad,The job involved loading variable sized merchandise onto trucks from a high speed conveyor at a central warehouse and unloading merchandise from trucks onto pallets.
bad,too much drama associated with the general managers and managers. there is no training for new employees. they are basically thrown in the job with no help
bad,I loved it at first but quickly grew to hate it when I was working over 70 hours per week. They will NOT give proper payroll hours to maintain you store so as the store manager you have to make it all up.
bad,"Dollar General dont really care for the well being and health of their employees. They dont really pay enough to live from so you would probably need to get a part time job, but the dollar General I worked at wouldnt allow me to. The supervisor mentioned something about it being against policy"
bad,you were always required to work 2 places at once.
bad,You miss one day cause your kid is sick and you go from full-time to working one day a week. The manager was always mad and if you didn't do and say what she wanted then no work for you
bad,The whole company is poorly ran. With the low store budgets and minimal employee pay I have no idea how this company is still in business when most of the stores are in the red
bad,"Learned stocking by using numbers"
bad,"The gm was crazy, you are forced to do register, customer service, recovery, go back, stocking, all while you have an assignment for the day that you're expected to complete.  Having to work other stores is common, you don't have a big enough crew for what you have to get done, closing is just you cleaning the entire store alone while manager counts $.  Schedule was always changing.  Their compliance with the drugs and alcohol laws was iffy at best, including allowing minors to sell these products with minimum supervision.  I would not recommend this job to anyone, especially at the location I had."
bad,Please run as fast as you can away from this job. The pay was low and management sucked very bad. They promote anyone who would stay with the company.
bad,slow paced environment with the perks of being able to visit with customers and make somenew aquaintences. i always love seeing the kids faces when they get a new toy.
bad,The only thing that was good about Dollar General in Boyle at the time was the manager. She worked with you but her managers were hard to deal with. She too eventually left because of them.
bad,The company is not a great place to work . They do not pay you what you are worth and the work environment is unpleasant . Also management does not care about the employees .
bad,Nothing positive to say. low pay and management expects to much while not helping. If you upset the manager they will cut your hours to the bare minimum. Managers and district managers play favorites.
bad,Was not well managed at all. Pay was horrible. Was not flexible or understanding at all with single parents. Went months without any management because nobody wanted the job. My worst employment experience.
bad,I was very excited to work at dollar general but after a month of working there you could tell that the manager had favorites and would complain about working around my college school schedule. I was told in my interview I would get thirty hours a week and after starting work I was given around eleven hours every week.
bad,"They never actually paid me for the hours I worked, they gave me al kinds of excuses. Sometimes they paid me the wrong amounts and after a few times of that they gave me thru around and never paid me period for the hours missing from previous checks."
bad,I work there for 2 and half years and it did little for my career. it needs to pay there employees more money. The hardest part of the job was dragging myself out bed every morning and single handily worked on the rolltainers.
bad,"The store is not up to standards, They need a night or early morning crew to stock all shelves in store and to keep store up to par."
bad,The management was very unprofessional and had no concept of employee welfare or professionalism. They were frequently absent from their own shifts and barely acknowledged the needs of their employees.
bad,the managers have no clue what they are doing.they right people up for everything i bit my tong and the rote me up for hurting my self not joking this is why i left.
bad,had fun while working there till the GM decided to want something done that wasn't capable of being done and then proceeded to yell at all of us for it.
bad,"Difficult to hire quality employees at the hourly rate company is willing to pay"
bad,Poor management they show favoritism. Lied at interview about everything Was told that it would be 30 hours a week I only was scheduled for 9 every week while other workers are putting in 40-50 hours a week. Was told I was being hired as assistant store manager but was not. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,It was a bad experience and I wouldn't recommend working there. The management is poor and the employee treatment is horrible! The store I worked at didn't even have  properly working air conditioning.
bad,The management team seemed very bias. Only certain people got the chance to get promoted. The employer can hardly keep their employees................
bad,"It's a fun place to work at if you're a active person. The management is so poor and unfair towards employees. They will work you for 12 hours with only a 45 minute break. It takes everyone 5 minutes to walk to the front, 5 minutes to reach our vehicle and crank it, 10+ minutes to find a restaurant, have to sit in line 15 minute just to get food, and 10 minutes to get back down the highway and relax and eat. By that time, its bout time to go to rush back in the building 5 minutes from the clock and get back to work. TIRESOME, STRESSFUL, AND MAKES YOU HATE YOU FAILED TO PUSH FURTHER AND FIND BETTER!! ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN WORKING A DG EVEN SITTING ON A CORNER BEGGING!!!"
bad,"I HATE IT , I HATE IT ! I HATE IT !!! I wouldn’t recommend anybody working for this company .. not even beginners , The customers are annoying . The key holders don’t like helping. You don’t get no type of raise or even a discount ."
bad,Not the place for me to work so much work not enough pay or enough hours. They are very nasty an rude an dont treat their employees right. Manager only care about looking good
bad,"-Terrible job culture"
bad,Horrible company to work for management is lazy and unfair. Not given the chance to prove your hard work. Cut hours for no reason. Poor pay and poor benefits.
bad,For the amount of resets stocking training you will over work yourself with this company because they are always short staffed once employees see the amount of work that's expected of them and what they're getting paid hourly they just walk out.
bad,The DM is an aweful person to work for if you have other job options don’t pick dollar general you aren’t cared abaout as an individual they don’t make anything do-able
bad,I would never work for Dollar General again and certainly wouldn't advise anyone I care about to work there. The management team was not sympathetic towards your personal needs and made promises that they did not follow through with.
bad,This was the worst job i'd ever had. I wouldn't suggest anyone go there EVEN if it's a temporary job to hold you over until you find something else. It's completely unprofessional.
bad,"excepts a lot of work for low pay.  Will bring people in for promotion then promoting people already there.  Hard to keep employees happy, have several managers that are considered office managers to where they want to sit in the office instead of helping"
bad,iTS bad but its not as bad they could be so much better they have a few down falls they let they managers say and speak to they employees in a bad lighting
bad,"Over worked, under staffed and no support of work life balance,"
bad,This is the most stressful job. The store I worked at was a mess when I was hired. We where told we would have help to get on pace. That never happened. We had empty shelves and an overflowing back room. Which led to a lot of customer complaints day in and out. Will never recommend this job to anyone ever.
bad,Dollar general dist.manger need meeting at  every Dollar General to talk to all employees to see want going on and  how they are treated by every employee and manger
bad,"They treat their employees like they're thieves and yet the customers who do steal, they never get in trouble. You work hard, long hours because the people who are supposed to show don't, you never get the respect you deserve, you could give them your first born and it still wouldn't be enough! You can't have a life and work here because your expected to just drop everything for them. There's no question as to why they can't keep employees...because they don't care about them!"
bad,managers talk about you in spanish so you can’t understand them until they say your name in english .. very dirty place .. don’t recommend working here
bad,One if the worst jobs I have ever taken. It was mainly just management. It could have been a great place to work. I loved the just b in general. Getting to know customers work with other employees. I enjoyed the job in general just terrible management.
bad,"there's always carts on every aisle, backup with stock, can't keep a manger for long, there's a mice everywhere, it's just a dirty place to work, it's also next to a dog place as well. DON'T WORK HERE, IT'S A BAD PLACE TO WORK, DON'T PUT A APP IF I WERE YOU!!!!!!!"
bad,"Managers are very rude."
bad,Horrible Horrible Horrible i hate it they are unprofessional poor management bad service store never clean poor district manager they terminate you over the dumbest things
bad,"I managed 2 Stores in the Chattanooga,TN market in which both stores were in bad shape when I took over the DM and Regional Director were both useless in helping me and could careless about their employees as long as the doors are unlocked and the store is open. I asked for help from my DM on several occasions, but never got any! You can’t learn how to operate the way they intend on you running the store if your not given the tools and direction needed! I would strongly suggest not working for this company unless your desperate for employment!"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone working here. I'm not sure if it was just the management that I worked under or if all Dollar Generals are ran the same, but the management was awful. They expected way too much out of one person. One person runs the entire store. Theft is out of control because there isn't enough coverage."
bad,"Low pay for all the work they have you do"
bad,"Terrible place to work, you are overworked doing a million jobs with  mediocre pay and the management all sucks and doesnt care about their employees."
bad,This company is really in between they could be a lot better and they do nothing but stress you but they do work you well and make sure you get your money worthy
bad,"It was an okay job I guess. I never got an opportunity to have keys, and I was really frustrated about that. I also think the DM we had was a joke. She talked to me maybe once. The whole company is a joke. The only good thing about it was my boss"
bad,"I open up the store, the store is a mess from last night crew, no one does what he or she needed to do for the store, management did not care back then, the workplace culture was offer full, the hardest part of the job was getting the manager to do her job, there was no enjoyable day at all."
bad,was not the best place place to work for me personally the overturn rate was high so we didn't have any help and i didnt get paid much of anything but we did get paid every week
bad,"no concern for work life balance, or security of employees. They are only concerned with how much they can bring in from ebt. Not enough employees. poor place to work."
bad,The management is failing to bring in employees and have a working schedule. They do not work with students in school or requested time off. It doesn’t matter how much an associate does if the manager is not properly doing their job the sales associates can not complete their job.
bad,Dollar General doesn't value their employyes. They expect their managers to run a store with no hours and get everything done. They don't keep people very long.
bad,Just a bad place to work they don't care for you or your family they don't have security the store location is extremely bad the employees don't have any respect for anyone an they hire anyone
bad,I did the job of the manager for the wage of a cashier. I was told no to moving up because they “didn’t want to lose me as a cashier” I would often run the store on my own.
bad,"My brief period with the company Nov. - Apr. was problematic from start to finish. From improper managment issues, payroll failures, zero training and absolutly no structure or routine. My time with the he company was one of my absolute most miserable experiences in my 34 year work history. Very understandable why employees never stay. I was warned by many but was a close to home position. One I wish I had never taken."
bad,"They do not care about their employees, I worked at several locations & all were terrible. Only 2 employees work at a time & you are expected to do every job as a cashier you have to stock & recover the store as well they expect you to stock so many totes in one day even if you are too busy on the register."
bad,"Dollar generals management was very unorganized,your training is a fail to learn type of training, there was always arguments and theft at the location."
bad,"This store has been in disarray since it opened, and still is. Management was no help in directing store operations or helping plan an organized store layout. Offers to help were met with a lack of interest in creative input. Even upper management seemed out of touch with how bad the situation is, and he's seen it first hand. I would only recommend this place to someone I disliked, for work or shopping."
bad,"Dollar general will be the most frustrating job anyone could have however if u need something while in college or in high school ,the work Schedule and hours they provide will be great"
bad,They don't care about employees. They hire instead of promote. They expect you to do what they cannot. Store was infested with rats told workers to put on gloves store smelled bad. Store shutdown every other month because of rats! Delivery truck drivers complained about smell. Rat tail hanging out of ceiling while customer was ringing up. All black ppl steal so they was always watched closely. Store manager was a pervert. Store always had clutter. I quit I was working 70+ hrs a week & wasn't able to get a set schedule. Not a good company to work for pay rate wasn't worth slave work!
bad,I think I spent 98 percent of my time at the register because none of my co-workers understood taking responsibility and getting the job done. It was all fun and games for them.
bad,"Dollar general is a company that works on a skeleton crew that is required to work 1000 piece truck, run register, help customers, and clean on 120 hours per week. You are frequently single coverage throughout most of the day nearly every day with single coverage from open until 5pm or 6pm. This company bleeds their employees dry until they can no longer manage the stress or until they no longer find them useful. The store manager then must make up the workload hour difference by working 60+ hours a week. Therefore, there is no home life for a dollar general store manager. If you calculate salary to hours worked you’re lucky to make $12-$13 an hour. It is not worth the personal sacrifice. The benefits for this company are laughable. Medical insurance costs nearly $200 a week out of a Paycheck that is luck to be over $600 for a store manager. Would not recommend employment through this company. Many hourly associates rarely get to take the length of their lunch break and don’t receive 15 minute breaks at all no matter the amount of hours worked. It is frequently difficult to use the restroom because of forced mandatory single coverage generated by the scheduling computer program."
bad,"Started to work there unknowing that i was being used for store owners benefit, working hours cause she didn't want to deal with some things. Making me work over 30 hours a week somethings to almost all the time, requested a certain month off 3 months in advance and never got it (with the saying TOO BAD)."
bad,All employees are replaceable to Dollar General.  No value is placed on any single employee.  My sister was injured while working for them and was terminated without explanation.
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General was not organized at all. Working for Dollar General was not a very good employer to work for. "
bad,When I started my shift was day and night. Due to favoritism in my current store all I work is nights. I only get to see my family 3 hours a week. Nothing I do for my manager is good enough. I have never been so miserable at a job in my life.
bad,"This is not an enjoyable place to work! The work is not hard, but the gossiping with the manager and employees created a culture of stress. I would not recommend this place to anyone at anytime."
bad,horrible company. they expected 10 hours of work done in 4 hours. never enough help. very underpaid. would not work there again. managers are also disrespectful
bad,Poorly ran store. Not everyone works hard so the ones that do get expected to pick up all the slack of others. Many complaints from customers because of things out of the control of cashiers.
bad,Dollar General wants you to do to much but doesn't pay enough money! The hardest part of the job is trying to throw stock by yourself when they are not giving enough hours for all the employees! They don't give the employees discounts are anything!
bad,You are over worked for what you get paid. Never complimented on your work. The store managers are friends with the GM so when you have issues you cant go to the GM to help resolve it.
bad,"Hated management. The employees were great to me. It seemed that my style of management which was a collaborative effort with my employees, was frowned upon with other members of management and hold them accountable while they were all playing corn hole in the break room for hours at a time."
bad,The customers were almost the besit psrt of working at dollar general. Sometimes they were annoying but super nice. Fellow employees seemed too good to properly train me or talk to me. Almost seemed like they forgot about the lonely cashier. Most everyone took ATON of smoke breaks. I barely got my lunch in time. Didnt get a break much cuz I said I didnt need one then it kicked my butt not getting one. Busted butt for nothing. They gave m less than 18 hours a week when I have a family of 7 to support. Dollar general is a bad place to work but fairly decent to shop at. Rant over
bad,It an okay company to work for but they do not keep their promises and the pay is not worth the job that needs to be done. My pay is under what an assistant Manager should be paid
bad,this workplace I worked at was very poorly ran and the management was very poor to and I do not miss working at the location at all. It may just been my location
bad,Took a broken store. Worked 29 days before I got a day off. Worked another 29 before my next day off. In 59 days I worked at least 10 of those days open to close. 13 hour days.
bad,Not pleased with hours or pay no hours means not any benefits.Ive got hurt cut hand with a box cutter and never was checked on. My manager seems to not care about her employees.
bad,Dollar General in general is not a good company to work for. They are all about making the $$$ than they are taking care of the existing employees or stores.
bad,They promise you to work only 54 then cut your pay roll so you have to work 8-10 by yourself then if someone calls out your stuck...I worked 70-80 weekly
bad,it is not a good place to work because they go in and out of job and plus new face sales floor everyday and they are very behind a stocker to put more in the selves.
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked"
bad,long days of working alone having to open and close store more than usually.  didnt learn much about the store nor being an actual manager.  the workplace wasnt safe had a lot of theives.
bad,needs improvement with management and communication skills. I learned to be nice when in a hostile work environment. Not an over all good experience. Needs Improvement
bad,"I did not enjoy working here. Management was unhelpful. Training was pretty much nonexistent. They took maybe five minutes to show me everything I needed to do, and then just said ""there ya go"".."
bad,I love the public.  I love people being able to see what our team can do. The Deltaville store is not a team which is why there is so much disarray. No team work.
bad,"Be warned, to be a manager here you will have no time for children, family or anything else in your life. You will be required to live in your store. 70 hours plus are the norm. No support from corporate or your district manager. This is a company that prides itself on the lowest paid and least amount of hours given to stores. No payroll for employees. You will be required to do every job in the store yourself. "
bad,"Some may find a good store. I know I did not. It does seem common practice to hire too many employees resulting in most employees get few if any hours.The employee discount is non existant and no benefits that I can see (you have to use the marketplace). So if you're in HS and only look for some pocket change, maybe. Just feel out the environment first. If you're anyone else, keep looking is my suggestions."
bad,"The store manager was all over the place, nothing was organized and made it a very stressful working environment. Honestly the worst job I’ve ever had."
bad,"I was a store manager and I was forced to work 70-80 hours per week at my salary of $42,000 annually. On conference calls on a Friday that since 4 managers in our district went over in hours we ALL had to cut hours 16 hours a piece. That meant I was going to have to be in my store from open to close by myself."
bad,I made it to lead (key holder) within 3 months of being there.  Got bumped from 7.25 to 7.75 an hour for taking on those responsibilities.  They were always understaffed / overworked.  Couldn't keep people.
bad,Dollar General is one of the worst places you could possibly work. Management does not care at any level and pay is abysmal. I would recommend any other store to shop at
bad,Dollar General is the worst company do you ever worked for.They will treat you like you’re a nobody they are favoritism is there certain employers. They don’t help you when you need help. So much more I can say about this company but it’s not a good company to work for and that’s all I’m gonna say.
bad,Not many hours and the manager was like a teacher picking a teachers pet!  The manager was unforgiving. Family issues she could care less about. not nice place
bad,At first it was great and fun but than manager changed and left. Than it went down hill. You dont get help from district all they say is it's your problem
bad,"Terrible Management at Store number 4090 in OKlahoma City, OK. Suggesting a complete overhaul of that store immediately! The store manager there is very possessive and needs to quit. Do her a favor!"
bad,"Turnover, Turnover, Turnover..  If you like volatility, 60hrs a week for minimal pay.. and District, Regional and Corp Management Executives that look to cut everything they can to make a buck...this is your place!  Its a graveyard of Nashville Executives that are Retail rejects from Genesco, Tractor Supply, Cracker Barrel, etc.. all with the same mentality."
bad,No work life balance. Not understanding of family medical emergencies. Very stressful fast paced work. I often worked in a store alone for more then 6 hours a day due to hours allotment
bad,"At Dollar General they expect you to do a lot of work, physical and mental for pay that's not worth it. Unloading trucks, lifting 50lb boxes all day, re-arranging shelves, stoking beer and drink coolers, paperwork, money management, etc. For $9/hr."
bad,"There was no joy in working there all the Co workers beat you down the customers treated you less than human, one person to man four peoples jobs then get yelled at for not getting it done"
bad,"Need more then 1 or 2 employees at a time and management accuses employees when things go wrong, to little pay for the work that needs to be done. Managers need to do same as employees as in stock and freight."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there for a first job. The pay rate is not enough for what you are requires to do and the managers expect for you to allow them to talk to you any kind of way. Also the managers think they are allowed to do things that you would get in trouble for. Dollar General is not a fair work environment.
bad,"To demanding of their employees, you are doing 3 or 4 jobs at once.  Too fast paced and manager was unfriendly with employees.  To long of a day and to stressful."
bad,"Dollar General is a place i would never work for again. stupid management stupid store, stupid everything about this place. hours is something they never give out as well..."
bad,"I'd asked for help to finish up with my chores once because we were closing, the girl that was ""managing"" said ""we are all assigned our own jobs, no we aren't allowed to help you finish up."" "
bad,"As Store Manager, you can expect that your District Manager will not support you in your endeavors.  You will work at least 12 hours a day, six days a week.  It is expected that you should take one day off during the week.  This will prove impossible as your people call out.  For all of the hours you will work, and the vacation you will use to cover payroll... you may as well work for free, as well as, give up any personal time."
bad,I would never recommend working here like maybe the fist couple of days was great until the boss only trains u one day and leaves u alone thinking u can do it but you cant
bad,"I use to work at Dollar General and they were very disrespectful, they never spoke to me unless they wanted me to do overtime. They manager never gave me my right amount on my check."
bad,"Worked as a General Manager,  I worked most weeks over 100 hours couldn't get enough hours for my store to get the help I needed, so I spent more nights in my store than in my bed every other week when I didn't have my son.  Dollar General does not care about its employees only about what piece of property they can buy next to place another building on."
bad,Fast pasta job I love working retail but I never seen a retail job that stressed me out or made me wonder if I would make it back home at the end of the day.
bad,"When I worked there, I was underpaid for the amount of work that I was doing. There was no consistency. I was an assistant manager and I never put in less than 50 hours a week."
bad,"I was promoted to a FT Key Holder within 2 months of working there and after that everything goes down hill. The store managers and regional managers do not care about anything other than making sure the trucks are worked quickly, incorrect product? Incorrect number of trailers? Who cares just get it done. If you work here use it as a little extra spending money and only do a PT Cashier"
bad,dollar general has its ups and its down. not the best place to work but it pays the bills. I wouldnt go back to the company and i wouldnt suggest that someone to do so.
bad,"no field support, poor technology, not enough hours to operate store effectively. little to no support from upper management but high expectations to perform with little tools to execute."
bad,Never wanted to be a store manager and they shoved me in a bad store I had to sleep in my vehicle bc it was so far away from my home . Poor training the trainer was a judgemental who didntncare about teaining or making sure you knew the right stuff
bad,"Never work for this company.the pay is horrible,management will run you to the ground thats if you can make enough hours.They make you take harrassement from customers to"
bad,"Managers do not care about their employees. According to them, family is not as important as the job, even when a family member is in the hospital. Garbage stores with garbage managers."
bad,I have nothing nice to say about the location I worked at on Masfield  Hwy In Forest Hill TX by Fort Worth TX it was very unprofessional the store was very nasty customers witnessed rats and it was just horrible that location should be closed down for good unless its under better management.
bad,"this place will hire any one and every one, even if they rob them blind, you constantly have to deal with the druggies coming in and out of the place because its next to a rehab center,"
bad,"the store should always have more than one employee for the amount of work that needs to be done there was lots of times that you would work an entire shift without any help or breaks. They expected you to stock, set displays and be the only cashier. There was no way for the customers to let someone know that they were ready to check out if you were in the back of the store. the store manager was continuously rude to customers, vendors and employees. Hostile work environment kept manager trying to find someone that wanted to stay within the company. Corporate is made aware of issues and they do nothing to help with them."
bad,rate of pay was very low for all task that need to be done and the hours suck also I was a key holder making 8 dollars a hour very sad for all task to be done
bad,As a store manager you will work no less then 60+ hrs a week with maybe one day off. If someone calls in you are required to get it covered for them or go in and cover the shift. Salary is very low and when you do the math based on hours worked the store manager is the lowest paid employee. Figure about $2 dollars an hour.
bad,This is the worst place to work they don't pay good they lie so they won't have to pay you unemployment they over look the good employees you dont have many hours
bad,"Wouldn't give me the time or day to work more and pursue more, even when requested....... I was dissatisfied with my time and work there.... "
bad,If you are going in to managment as a store manager. Your schedule will be 60-70 hours a week. you are only allowed one day off a week and if someone calls out or don't show up you are the one stuck working it.  You will be working for a company that does not care about your life or anything else but hours and labor. Good luck if you take the Job with them. Most managers burn out with in 6month - year
bad,Unreliable management dirty store no set hours just horrible place to work for no manager for months an months no employees so we had to work doubles all the time
bad,"When I get to work, I sign in check my till for the shift correct money, start stocking shelves, facing products in each isle work with employees, clean up store give appropriate breaks. At the end of shift I make bank deposits, count tills go to bank night drop. secure building cash out cashiers.The job is very fast pace and can be strenuous lots of heavy lifting bending and climbing ladders.WE did have a great manager last year but she had to leave, and new manager started two weeks later she was out for 9 weeks surgery so very diffacult to operate with no manage."
bad,"Dollar general is a place for high school and college students to work. Because the only person that is full time is the store manager and above in management. the hours are very few every week as well as the pay. The pay raises are only twenty five cents once a year, and the full time employees are the only ones that receive a vacation from the company."
bad,The company set very unreasonable expectations for employees.  I would not recommend working for this company at all.  This is the only job I ever walked out on.
bad,"There is no training, so when you don't do something that  are supposed to know then you get griped at. Biggest issue was the management was dictators. Very hard to work for and deal with."
bad,"DG is full of back stabbing lying snakes.  Say I thing do another,  behind your back. They only paid managers & up get a  living wage. No one else matters. Even the DM lies."
bad,"I did not have a good experience working for this company. The management was very poor - constant schedule changes, impossible work goals, poor people skills. There is a very high turnover rate. I was left for hours alone at this store and expected to be a cashier, stock shelves and handle the truck. There is little teamwork and it doesn't feel like teamwork is encouraged. Communication was lacking. Training felt incomplete. I felt that the pay to workload/responsibilities was way off. You will get paid the very minimum for your position. This was an overall negative working experience."
bad,"The first store I worked for had a wonderful staff and manager. The second one lacked any respect for staff and management, would hold you back from clocking out, only give negative criticisms, and I will never return to this company."
bad,"Stressful environment, Inadequate equipment, poorly managed facilities. Unclean environment and unpleasant employees. No safety concerns for employees"
bad,I did not like working at dollar general and I would never go back I do not recommend that job to any of my family and I think the under pay there staff .
bad,I was only there for a few months. I can't really say to much on the negative side or positive. The store I was at was in a rough location and was robbed overnight.  It was some ocean type robbery.
bad,"Manager lacks experience in all areas, threatens write-ups if work is not done on time. Favoritism , and lying manipulation of employees. Manager is in a good mood as long as she gets her way."
bad,"Customers treat dirt better than they treat you at Dollar General. Management had no idea what they were doing. Sometimes you worked six hours a week, then out of nowhere you have a 40 hour work week."
bad,This place would not be recommended by me to no one. Managers have favorites so its pointless to even work there if you are always looked over and dont have anyone to listen to you.
bad,"It was a job to help me out when I moved from tampa, but it wasn't working with my schedule. I have two kids and my husband works early, and it was just to much on meeting"
bad,"Their best offer was $10.50 an hour for asst store mgr and that's having solid experience.   They wonder why they have unmotivated employees & a high turnover rate. Offered the job to me and told me I'd receive a packet via email.  Never received an email and the store manager wouldn't return my call or text message the following day.  Contacted the DM whom I'd talked to initially and was advised that they were still interviewing and the store manager had told him I acted unsatisfied with the pay.  I did ask for more than they offered me (who wouldn't?) but I still accepted the position despite the low pay as I needed the income.  Disorganized, unprofessional and the salary offered for what they need and want to accomplish is an insult to anyone with or without management experience.  You get what you pay for, yes even when it comes to employees DOLLAR GENERAL.  I'd avoid applying here unless you're desperate for work and I'd leave the interview with your job offer in writing as a handshake and verbal agreement doesn't mean anything here."
bad,Upper management is sub-par to say the least. All upper management from District managers on up are unfair due to the companies ineptitude in employee retention. This makes all employees incapable of having a comfortable happy work life.
bad,At Dollar General you are overworked and underpaid. The work is never ending and you are always behind on your work. It is not a fun and enjoyable place to work. Management treat you like you are not valued and you can be easily replaced.
bad,Just need more hours went from 30+ to 20 - .they hired 4 new workers and cut my hours . I would be totally satisfied to have full time hours and not being a full time employee with part time hours.
bad,The store managers are rude and expect a miracle to be preformed when they could have planned everything before or ahead of time. Everything is just not organized.
bad,"Managers have no control over their store.  They are Micromanaged so heavily that it's impossible to get your job done correctly with confidence.  Upon my separation from the company, my team left with me due to the way we were treated by regional directors and regional loss prevention managers."
bad,Began working for DG a year ago. Was always told i eas one of if not the best worker. Year later nee manager i get let go because of her own ego. She has had multiple complaints on her performance as store manager and upper management does nothing about it.
bad,I would never recommend this place to anyone...The company is sick and they do not care about your sickness it health or if your kids are sick I put in time and energy and didn't get not one raise...I worked double and did over nights and I worked hard people gave great feedback on my work performance and customers loved me and they accuse me if there's but I didn't take anything so I'm still confused...
bad,"Dont do it, you will regret working here! We were robbed at gun point twice in four months and they dont want to do anything to increase the safety of its employees. Two big thumbs down!"
bad,You do not get enough hrs you have to try to work at other stores to get more hrs .you do not get paid enough for the amount of work you do for them. You are aways alone in the store working cause they dont give enough hrs you cant buy a drink until you go on lunch are someone else comes in.the company does not treat there loyal crew member right
bad,"This corporation is run like a plantation"
bad,"Staffing is always an issue, stressful worn environment. Expected to do the work of 3 people in one shift. Pay sucks, not worth the hassel. Managers try to nickle and dime every chance they get. Will overwork you as long as they stay under budget."
bad,Management is very poor and there is a lot of favoritism. Culture doesn't exist and the supervisors aren't held accountable for how they treat people. Turnover rate is beyond high and they can't keep bodies in the building because of that
bad,Too many working hours and not enough people to help with the staffing.  I literally went a whole month double shifting with no days off because my district needed me to be there because staffing was low.  People did not want to work for her because she failed to give me hours to properly staff my store to get the backroom cleared and provide good customer service.
bad,"I loved shopping at Dollar General so I thought this would be a good job for me. I absolutely hate it here. The expectations for this job is way to high. Managers only care about themselves and not others. Does not help mental health. Always stressful, rude customers, and short staff. No benefits for part time. Just way to stress full. Do not recommend working here unless its a starter job."
bad,"I don't personally believe this would ba a good job for anyone including high school students. Over worked, under paid, and under appreciated. You start at the bottom and everything gets put on you."
bad,"Nothing to say   I wish I would have not work for this company, they will hire anyone as long as they are breathing. I will be glad when I get a new job"
bad,Poor management. Dont train you very well. Could care less about helping you advance in the company. Kiss a lot of butt to get where they are. (Store managers)
bad,Low paying company. Takes years to advance.  No paid off days. No vacation. No benefits. Unrealistic goals to achieve every day. Not a good job at all.
bad,"I had a terrible experience working for dollar general. The management was absolutely horrendous. They do not care about you, only their sales. The environment was very cut throat and I did not enjoy one single day of working there."
bad,"terrible to work for, over worked, underpaid, never enough help, always too much to do. this company always wants something for nothing. people expected to do way more on a daily basis than is even possible"
bad,You way 14- 16 hour days sometimes by yourself.  There is no help from regional management. You never see family because you are always working. The job is hard and tasking for very little pay.
bad,"it was a okay place to work."
bad,"It was not a conducive environment to do your job properly. A lot of in-fighting and rumor spreading. We worked long days,even through our lunch break and were expected to do too much for what they paid. I was supposed to be part-time but worked full-time hours. The management was unbelievably bad. They were more like dictators than bosses."
bad,They do not appreciate their employees as they should. Especially the hard working ones. The management break a lot a rules and then blame the employees.
bad,"Worked over 60 hours per week. Never compansated for over 45 hrs. Worked 36 hours straight, never acknowledge acheviment. Takes district manager days to have a solution on a problem or instructs you to handle it even after all resources have fail on resolution."
bad,"no work life balance,  terrible pay, uppermanagment a joke if your a manager you really only a stock person to them."
bad,Not a good place to work. Managment was belittling and rude. They did not recognize improvements only everything that was wrong with their employees. I woukd not recommend working there.
bad,they give no training nor the tools you need to do the job the pay is horrible they work you like a dog promise you a bonus but never give it to you just a really bad company to work for
bad,"Poor days and hours. Very inconvenient , and poor pay rates. Take up your life with different work days week by week. Closing one night then coming back , opening. Work off the clock.."
bad,The company hires mediocre employees in small rural towns and has absolutely no consideration for the communities that they build in. the employees are not well taken care of Nora are there background checks on the right employees
bad,"I would never recommend Dollar General as a place to work. When I worked there, management was horrible, and they would always a way to criticize an employee. There was a whole lot of back stabbing in the store when I work there. Management, and even regular employees would always try to find a way to advance, even if it meant throwing other individuals under the bus. They would also try to get anyone they didn't like fired."
bad,"Being a Store manager at Dollar General you dedicate your life to the store. The job comes before your family, friends, or any activities you may want to do. I had one of the best looking stores in my area and I had to work 60+ hours a week to keep it that way. When I was younger the hours were  fine but as you age family becomes more important than a job. The store consumes your life."
bad,"No home life, if your salaried your expected to work 48 to 70 hours per week depending on your District manager. Dg is DG does not stand by its own mission statement."
bad,"Horrific pay, minimal hours, poor management, disgusting customers, disrespectful workers and much much more. Please don't work here it's not worth a cent."
bad,management sucked pay sucked cutomers are rude. the compant dont care about their employess. they wont promote. they are disrespectful to their employess.
bad,It was a typical work place very fast pace busy all the time and people we nice. I would defiantly recommend this work place to a friend or family member.
bad,Work open to close day in and day out. High shrink store thst never hits sal bonus. Difference is pay per gender. Man gets 500 more. Never can u reach hr if u have a problem. They preach integrity and ethics. Ha just another lie
bad,"typical day at dollar general would be opening the store counting money open registers and start taking costumers I was on register, ran u boats, stocked shelfs, very steady pace ."
bad,"work 6 days a week only get paid for 40 hours & work 70-80 hours. little to no help and you cant get them to help hire or promote for hiring, and lack of balance or determination to try from supervisors or district managers, its like they only want a paycheck and to not have a successful company!"
bad,"Worse job I ever had. Mgrs, supervisor,  and hr know absolutely nothing. They make up rules that fit them as they arise. Rules vary and are different for each employee.  Nothing is confidential."
bad,They do not care about their employees all they care about is the bottom dollar. They do not pay you what you deserve for the work you do. If you are injured they do not care.
bad,as the store manager I was often made to make up for the lack of hours by working 5 to 6 hours by myself not getting a lunch break and most of the time unable to use the restroom. I was told on one occasion to use my vacation hours to pay for the stores hour overages. there was a period of time when I had to work 22 days in a row due to nobody wanting to work there after I told them the hours I could give them. you always work overtime but never get compensated for it. they just want to use and run people down till they recycle you for a younger quicker version.
bad,My store manager was/is in the wrong profession. The pay was terrible for the amount of work I was required to do. I am a reliable and dependable person and that became something the manager took advantage of.
bad,"this has been the worst place I have ever worked.  District Manager is convinced ever employee is stealing,  I took the position on the understanding I would have insurance in 31 days.  This was not true."
bad,"Constantly busy, but I was always the only cashier. Nobody ever taught me anything. I would learn by watching others. When customers asked questions, I would constantly have to ask another employee, then employees would make me feel like I was wasting time. Asking employees for help would also hold up the line. I wasn't even taught where anything in the store was."
bad,this could be a fun job if there was more help to keep the checkout lines going and the shelves cleaner. there is not enough employees to keep the store running smoothly. if you don't mind lack of help when it is busy then this could be the job for you
bad,"culture very bad poor pay, hours, promised a position never delivered bias against older people? not a good work environment.poor scheduling and poor management poor hours never over 16 high turn over due to poor hiring skills"
bad,"They do not pay well.  Never enough staff to run the store.  For the amount of work required during a scheduled shift, the pay is not equivalent.  Very poor communication between management and store employees."
bad,horrible work environment. no room for improvement and not friendly to employees. would not recommend to a friend. Pay is horrible as well. I wont even shop there because i know how bad they treat there items
bad,"management was terrible, I was never trained properly and was paid extremely poorly for the mount of work and effort I was doing. i do not recommend working here if you intend on being able to pay for essential living things"
bad,"Did not have a good experience at this job. Worked as an Lead Sales Associate in Pittsburg,TX and had full-time hours.Manager quit in the middle of a renovation. Had to work 16 hour shifts for three weeks. We lost Sales Associates. Then I transferred to Leavenworth,KS was demoted to Sales Associate. The manager at the time did not give me a set scheduled. He also did not inform me of a schedule change when he did post it."
bad,"lot of stealing went on at the work place"
bad,"Worked myself to death as a store manger. 80+ hours a week just to fix a failing store and watch it handed over to a ""friend of the District Manager"". This company has horrible values. Work/life balance is non existent. Lean labor isn't even close. Pulling shifts by yourself in a store just to keep labor down. Then you are held accountable for shrink that you cant control because you are the only one there stuck at a register. Hours provided only cover 2 people at the store about 70% of the time it is open. Much less taking into account stocking shelves before the doors open. So actually 50% 2 person coverage while the doors are open. Creates a huge opportunity for robbery. Care for employee safety is a joke. HR is only a phone call away to a foreign country. Worst experience of my 20+ years of management experience."
bad,I worked there for a little under 3 years and went through 13 managers during that time. the location of the store is in a rough neighborhood and therefore we had a lot of problematic customers.
bad,When I first started there management was ran pretty swell but then everything changed once they hired a substance abuser as a manager. The place went down hill and also the workers were stressed out because lack of knowledge in the manager's role. The regular staff was running the store better then the manager who stayed drunk and high on the job all the time.
bad,"This place is a joke, "
bad,"Never any staff, always alone. The pay and expectations are horrible. Unloading the truck in the heat and expected to put truck up so many boxes per hour but don't include that you have to run back and forth to the register. No time to take care of your customers."
bad,"as a former employee , i was hired when i was pregnant ,and i was a lead sales associate, i was expected to lift weight i shouldn't have been lifting, very short breaks, the management /manager wouldn't hire more people so i had to pick up as many shifts as their was , and when i had to leave in the event of an emergency concerning my daughter i was not aloud to leave , so their for i was forced to walkout in the middle of my shift and never return"
bad,"Do not work for them, you will regret it. They dont care about there customers, employees, or there stores. Even for a brand new store that is falling apart. Oh, and you wont feel safe there at all. My store got robbed and nothing was done for us from the company. Employees need to feel safe where they work. That person had a fully loaded shotgun that he could have used."
bad,"Not a fun place to work, they don't guarentee your hours. Management sucked, pay sucked i just had an overall bad experience. They pick favorites, just don't work there you can find better."
bad,Long days/nights double shifts hazardous environment high turnover rate break-ins/robberies no culture racism under paid workers no home life stressful.
bad,"Not enough hours or Pay and also never switched shift to work mornings only evenings or nights "
bad,I really did not like working there because of management. The hours were net what I was promised and it didnt fit in with my family life.So due to family issues I eventually had to resign.
bad,It just was place that I have experience the satisfaction of assisting member's with different products. Helping me put together things for family. Which this company did not pay a lot but for the most part I have learned enough to move on to the next job.
bad,Not a job i would refer to anyone. Prepare to do your job title along with many others. There's no such thing as team work working at Dollar General. Prepare to be on your own.
bad,"Overworked and treated poorly at this job. i wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. There motto is, everyone is a thief, including all employees. Worse job ever"
bad,"never work for a dollar general, you will get screwed over. They will make you do more work than you can and then get mad when the store doesn't look good. The managers are often left alone during the day which leaves them vulnerable to theft. Not good policies at all"
bad,I worked there for a few months until i found out i was preganant. when i told them they still had me get on my hands and knees and clean the floors with bleach when i was already having problems with my baby.
bad,its ok to work for them if you are a teenager living at home an in school. It will help you to pay for school books and gas to get back and forth. So if you need a part time job as a young teen go for it
bad,"They expect you to work around the clock with no balance, they fail to support you, and the turnover is high.  The management team doesn't care about anyone."
bad,The pay for management is terrible and so are the benefits. I was hired a supervisor or what the call a key holder. Two weeks later I was hired as the Assistant manager. My hours were extremely inconsistent as a manager and I also had to work hours according to the budget.
bad,I worked for Dollar General twice and both times I enjoyed my work. The problem is I was promised advancements that was never met. Not only did I fix a store and clean up managments issues but also increased customer satisfaction. when the manager returned from sick leave the store returned to disray. The second time I was hired the manager promised advancement. I discovered this was just something that she told me to get me to come back to the company. There were no plans of future advancements and she wanted to keep me in her store as an assitant manager.
bad,"entry level job, good if you need a quick level job for your resume, I personally used it as a first job in order to get experience for another job later in life."
bad,My hours were all over the place.  I was overwhelmed.  My manager had learning to many jobs at once.  I opened and closed the store.  She yelled at me a lot.  She treated me badly.
bad,"I worked for the company for several months under a horrible assistant manager and the main manager never showed up or did anything about the bad working environment. My other coworkers even tried to deal with her nonsense and several of them quit as well. I hated having this experience because I was so excited to work for the company, thinking it would be a decent job to start a steady career but I was SO wrong."
bad,I really loved working with Dollar General when I first started.  There is no room to move up in the company and they almost always hire manager positions out side of the company.
bad,"Dollar general CAN be a fantastic place to work if you are under the right leadership, SOME upper management will buy into you and help your development, although this company is severely still ran on the buddy-system which is who you know, and how much they like you. beware of this company. I have found more bad than good, although I did enjoy developing team members and seeing their careers blossom, do not for one second think that they will do it for you."
bad,The company does not care about their employees.  They expect them to do the work of 2 people at minimum wage.  They only people they care anything about is the stockholders.  They cut hours at Christmas to make sure the stockholders get the most money at the end of the year.  their is not even an employee discount for working there.
bad,"bad manage inconsistent hours and not enough hours or pa. not much new to learn. it was a messy store couldnt keep it clean, management had cashier do all work they didnt want to do plus do what is required of the cashier. Most enjoyable is working and helping customers out."
bad,If you want hours to make ends meet dont recomend working there. Its ok place to work but hours aren't worth it if yoi need alot of income. The staff is really nice though. Just not enough hours.
bad,People never get enough hours the stores are hazordous and most of them have no benefits and dont pay u for all ur hours and shady things happen......
bad,everyone has there opinions and I sure do have mine and mine is not a very good one at that so I am not going to go into detail about it but I will for sure never work for dollar general ever again.
bad,I was very unsatisfied working at the dollar general because of the manager of my store. She was very unprofessional and unorganized. She spent more time outside smoking and on the phone then she did doing her job and then she complained when we were behind trying to get things done by a deadline. she was the manager and everyone else worked more than she did. She would call people in early just so she could leave. She wouldn't provide good training.
bad,"I worked here when there weren't very many people left working. I had started with many coworkers, but we were usually struggling to get the days off we needed. If your hours didn't match up with that of the assistant manager, she'd assume you quit."
bad,I worked for Dollar General and everything in the system was flawed. I went through 3 different managers since I was hired because no one wanted the job. The pay was terrible for the hours I had to put in and Everyone is built on a hearsay method for advancement.
bad,"i was doing amazing there when i first got hired on and was training to be a key holder when my manager left, i got a new store manager that was impossible to work with and then i got hurt out side of work and she tried to fire me even with all the legal ramifications and proof i needed and was so bad to the other key holder she quit and i believe the assistant is about to quit as well. i would have been a long time employee of dollar general if not for the treatment of the people"
bad,"Started out pretty great as a cashier and moved up quickly to a keyholder.   However a few months in IT hit the fan and all half the management team quit leaving only 2 keyholders and one must be in the building at all times.  We were left for months on our own to survive.  I closed (2pm-11pm) every single day for nearly 4 months while the other employee opened.  For her to have a day off I had to work from open to close (730am-11pm).  So much working off the clock and having to do things completely outside our job codes including scheduling, store planning, etc. "
bad,From the time I got to work I started checking out customers. At closing time I did my nightly closing duties. The best part about the job was the customers.
bad,Very poor training. I was promised a pay raise never got. I was to figure everything out on my own. The pay is terrible. They pay the district managers way to much to drive around. Yet the store employees are the ones making the store run. Not fair.
bad,"Unfortunately the pay is awful, the hours are just not there, and there is no consistency. There really is not any room for advancement past the Lead Sales Associate. You will not be paid decently for the amount of stress you will be put through."
bad,"Dollar General provides a fast paced and hard working environment.  It provides opportunity to develop excellent customer service skills.  In an environment such as this, one learns integrity, communication skills, and how to satisfy customer needs.  Meeting new customers and seeing them return as repeat customers is the most enjoyable part of this job.  I've learned to sharpen my management skills in relations with employees and to work as a team member."
bad,"Was rude and got less hours"
bad,"at first working was such a great exoerince but as time kept going the store slowlky began to go down , they stopped caring how the store was looking wasnt cleaning agter the store was cutting hourd"
bad,You are expecting to do everything in the store and still be paid minimum wage. I was a manager making 8.25 well below the cost of living. There are not enough workers and to much to do. Yet if everything isnt done the dm looses it. Yet hes prob never even worked in a store. Acusses everyone but who needs it as well.
bad,"Dollar General is a total joke! They say they care about their employees but if they did they would actually pay them enough to want to work there! Instead they pay cheap, cut hours, expect ONE person to do the work of at least FIVE each shift. It’s a total joke! Shame on you Dollar General!! Shame!!!!"
bad,There wasn't any room for advancement and the management was very negative along with all the employees. This is a very slow paced job. Employee morale is very low.
bad,They treat you like a common criminal they over work you on your shifts their top out pay is way to low for the job most of the stores is nasty and they get robbed a lot and DO NOT CARE FOR YOUR SAFTEY
bad,I did not work there as effectively as I could have because I was not trained sufficiently. Also only worked 1 day a week and had 1 hour of training..
bad,Dollar General sucks! terrible place to work little or no benefits. I would not recommend working there to anyone. My store started employees at minimum wage.
bad,"Could not get the hours I was hired for. The management was terrible, even had me show up for a truck at 5am when the truck wasn't until the next day."
bad,"A typical work experience at Dollar general is very stressful due to the managers lack of work ethic. The Assistant manager and key holders are essentially the only ones running the store, they don't receive ample time off nor are their needs met. The assistant manager has been acting store manager more than once and the current manager has been stealing for as long as I was there. I would never recommend it to anyone looking for employment"
bad,"While I really quite enjoyed the actual work at Dollar General (interacting with customers, stocking shelves, etc), the management was poorly trained and generally awful, and the store was in continuously poor condition."
bad,"Pretty much the worst experience ive had working for a company, every store manager is out to get every other store manager and nobody is looking out for you. if you want to get decent hours you have to beg and work at 3 different stores. no overtime is permitted and the pay is low. there is probably a better job than this one available to you."
bad,"This company demoted me for taking bereavement. when brought to the district managers attention, i was then cut hours. the management team is very rude and only care about themselves. the stores are dirty and very disorganized."
bad,"Like i said above. Job was cake, but manager made it unnecessarily rough. I had no problem with the heavy lifting of the job, but my manager was one of the most mean spirited women i've ever known."
bad,busy had to basically do it all my self I seriously am glad I don't work there anymore I want to find a better job and one that has benefits. there was no healthcare no employee discounts. no dental care
bad,This job requires too much from you. The manager is hardly in the store. Employees are basically pulling all the work. There is no order or structure. I feel that it is definitely important that the manager is present because he is the leader of the store. Many dollar generals are messy because there is no structure within the store. I think the company needs order. The pay rate is not enough for the work we do. It is really hard to pick up the slack of your manager.
bad,I hated working there. It  was gross and always over stocked. Never enough room to walk in the aisle and the management was really bad. I wasnt ever clean.
bad,"You have No Life outside of work, no payroll hours, no staff.Family is not respected with this company. They treat managers like slaves. No matter how much you work or how hard it is NEVER enough."
bad,This company does not care about their employees at all it could be a family  situation going on with your kids they tell you you cant leave and or if you had an emergency like to go to the hospital they will ask you to make a choice either hospital or loose your job they don't  pay much for all the stuff they make you do the like to slave their employee i would' t recommend anyone to work for them
bad,The store is constantly in a state of disaster because we could never get deliveries put out in time so back stock was a mess and often flowed onto the sales floor. The job is extremely stressful and asks way too much of you for too little of pay. I was doing 100 things at once while people kept yelling at me to more. The manager was mediocre. She was nice but was desperate to keep people. She begged and tricked me into coming back only to have quit a week later herself. This is definitely not a job for someone who is young and trying to balance a life with their job. This place consumes you until you have nothing left.
bad,i did not like the management staff at all. they are not flexiable or understanding at all. enjoy doing the work and the people i worked with it but thats it
bad,"Plays with schedules to ensure the majority of employees are legally part-time even though most weeks they work 35+ hours. No standards when it comes to employees, leaving great workers feeling underappreciated and drained. Great place to work if you are a drug user and are not a hard worker."
bad,"Terrible. Unfairly treated. Manager will get you fired for no reason, and lie. They never try to help you when you need it.They'll work together, but not with you while stocking."
bad,"The hours were terrible. The store manager was prejudice towards men, she actively avoided giving me my raises, and everyone there is looking for an excuse to leave because of the difficult environment that is Dollar General."
bad,"employed part time but only received four hours a week that clashed with my school schedule. managers had me clock out  at time of closing regardless if my work was finished or not,"
bad,I highly recommend another job!! The management only care about themselves!! They will make others come in early and stay if no one comes in even if you have other things to do!! People keep quitting all the time so it makes your job harder!!!
bad,worst part was having to unload trucks and put up stock once a week . could be fun at times I liked working with some of the people and many of the customers were very nice
bad,Don’t work there it is not a job for anyone they make you work a lot of hours just to pay you a little bit of money the mangers talk to you any type of way
bad,"By far the worse company I have ever worked for. The pay for assistant manager is no where near what it should be. On numerous occasions I had to run the entire store by myself. From cashiering, checking in vendors as well as play security because it was such a high shrink store. I am pretty certain that I will not want to work for Dollar General ever again."
bad,"Worked here for 2 in a half years with promises of manager from the beginning. They would rather hire someone off the street with no experience and no knowledge of retail or how this particular company operates and let them destroy the store. In my time here we received 5 managers, 4 district managers, and 3 Regional managers so I don't think any one is content at this company. They don't give you enough hours to do anything, run freight, run register... nothing"
bad,"Dollar general and all levels of management care more about money and greed then the safety of it's employees or customers."
bad,"I wouldn't want my worst enemy to work here. The pay is horrible, management sucked, lazy managers, no benefits....horrible all-together! DO NOT WORM HERE EVER!"
bad,"this job was stressful and after my injury they fired me for no reason, I gave them the proper medical notes from my doctor, and gave them everything I could"
bad,"The managers who work for Dollar General should not be managers.  Long hours, sometimes none. Little pay for a lot of work, and a lot of extra things to handle"
bad,However the dm would tell you what you wanted to hear most of the time others it was that your messing up when you ask how it was never a clear answer and she could never tell you how to improve
bad,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE WORKING HERE Even though you work for there company you are treated and being watched like a criminal at all times Terrible
bad,"Started off as a great job, but management changes too frequently and the last manager I had blamed everything on the other employees and had 0 accountability."
bad,"To much to do and not enough time! "
bad,i had the worst manager ever... she was two faced and talked about every employee there... turns out she was doing illegal things that got her fired and she is being investigated
bad,"I do Love the customers, The management is not the best. They also want you to do EVERYTHING cashier stock mags planagrams  pretty much what asst manager does. But not pay you well."
bad,Get better benefits and management better ordering system better back stock system everything about your inventory system sucks. I would never go back if it was the only pce to go
bad,"The pay is horrible. You are expected to do way more than is logical. Most regular customers are great. A LOT of customers leave more mess in one shift than two people can clean up. The company expectations are insane. The store is so busy from the time you get there until you leave you can't complete anything other than being on the register withh a second person as back up constantly. You are constantly badgered about, ""why isn't the store perfect?"" When you finally do have a lunch break customers come outside and tell you you need to come inside and help the other employee. They honestly don't believe we are human and deserve to eat or have a lunch break at all. You deal with customers stealing and threatening you (because you catch then stealing)already 1-5 times a shift."
bad,"The company doesn't care about its employees. Minimum wage, hours that were constantly changing every week so I couldn't keep a consistent schedule. Every training video I watched was more focused on employees stealing than customers shoplifting. There were a ton of rules that made no sense. Nothing about this place gave me a good vibe except the few cool people I worked with."
bad,"If you want to never have a life outside of work then this is the best place for you to work. No staff, no raise, dirty stores, poor working conditions, even the upper management gets treated better then a store manager. You are made to work in a store with only two people at a time, if someone calls off you have to be there no matter what. The staff refuse to help if there is a needed call for them to step up. The store hours get cut and you will have to fill in the gaps."
bad,"Shoplifting was very high and difficult to catch them in act. Upper management did not seem to care."
bad,"On average I work about 4 hours every two weeks and when you are suppose to get paid $8.25/hour; weekly that is most definitely not enough, the management is ridiculous, they expect you to clean the store, make sure all products are moved forward, check out all customers, get carts, and complete any tasks assigned to you in a 4 hour period while they will take multiple smoke breaks within that time. When manager assistance is needed the are no where to be found and most days there are only 2 people in the store working at all times. Management also allows customers in the backroom to use the employee restroom, the office is not locked up and neither are the employee files. All employees and management are female and white which shows no diversity among employees. Some employees have also called a specific truck driver a ""towel head"". I don't recommend ever working for this company it is awful."
bad,work at Dollar General was terrible. Morning shift I worked alone. Too much for one person to do and no lunch break or any break for that matter if you work the morning shift.
bad,Dollar general does not care about its employees at store level. Was not properly trained and they did not care. Stressful environment. Constantly feel like you are the only one doing anything and they will not help when you need it. They do not give enough hours to keep the stores neat clean and truck worked and expect the manager to do everything including the register.
bad,For someone who's only been on the job for two days I had to put away inventory in 30 minutens and there were things put in different items where there shouldn't be so I had to go find where they needed to be or put in a cart so they could be put away later so it took me longer than it should and it didn't sit well with the key holder who was working and she told me that I needed to move faster. The store is always dirty and looks dingy and they have the isles full of carts and things.
bad,"As I say it’s a lot of work for a little bit of money. There’s a lot of favoritism. He has his picks. I recover the store to the best of my knowledge and he still has a problem with my work. He says I don’t do enough but every time I come to work the next day, the store is exactly how it was when I left. So I don’t see where work is getting done."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company. They do not value their employees."
bad,The store manager was stealing the money from the safe telling the key holders at night to ignore it and he will fix it in the morning. He was a pervert and sexually harassed women. The manager cut my hours when I reported him to corporate and I reported that and nothing was done at all by the DM.
bad,"The only thing I have to say about this place, is to never apply. They do not pay unless its minimum wage and they work you to death. Please reconsider applying"
bad,"want to start everyone at 7.25"
bad,"First of all,only full time employees get guaranteed hours, and even then the shifts are inconsistent. You will probably never have the same days off every week. If you put in a request for a day off, half the time it will be ignored. Unless you get hired to stock primarily, your shifts and hours will remain inconsistent. Calling in when you have an emergency is a pain and because the stores have so little employees the managers may take it out on you. Trying to have a life outside of work is almost impossible because the schedules are always a mystery and they will call you in frequently. The work is alright, just general retail stuff like stocking, cleaning, and cash register. The stores are always terribly understaffed and the lines become long really easily. The customers are always forced to wait for one reason or another and that makes them extremely unhappy. The technology is outdated and the registers have lots of problems. For the most part, the job is extremely miserable."
bad,"Its a very stressful job. There is too many customers & not enough workers to get the tasks corporate wants completed daily. You just dont have the time. "
bad,"If you get hurt doing your job, they won't work with you on accomidations.  If you are threatened, nobody stands up for you.  You feel like you are in the store alone most of the time."
bad,Worst job I ever had! Even full-time employees barely ever get anywhere close to 40 hours a week. They are extremely under-staffed and want one person to do the job of 5 people and steadily ask for more. Pay is a joke! I was a manager barely making $8 an hour.
bad,The corporate structure is unclear and scattered when it comes to expectations. The new employee is just thrown into situations and expected to do things correctly without any supervision and then rebuffed if the work is not right. You always feel very tenuous when working there. You never know what is going to hit you on responsibilities.
bad,"Management was poor and generally unagreeable. Stores were dirty, cramped, and poorly maintained. Plumbing wouldnt work, lights would be out for weeks. Low pay, no benefits and dealing with grumpy customers."
bad,"Employees were at each others throats constantly, the manager couldn't keep employees for the way they were treated. Hours were short and no raises were given to employees."
bad,"Dollar General does not pay well and certainly not for management for the amount of hours required. Most of their stores have only 1 to 2 people on at a time that are require to unload, stock and assist customers which causes the manager to work 60+ hours a week to get what needs to be done completed."
bad,manager shift alot from store to store so honestly  it sucks  as you get  people who follow policy  to a t that makes the job more stressful i would not  recommend this company to any one
bad,"I did not enjoy my employment, at first I did but something's went terribly wrong .. I'm seeking for better employment asap. I am a good worker but I hate to work under favoritism"
bad,Company not very professional. Not given enough hours to support a family. The pay was not enough to stick around. The manager was a very unprofessional manager.
bad,Its a very demanding job with little to  no help. Everything is expected to be done immediately with little to  no help. I loved the idea of running my own store. It was just having such demands that's were unattainable. District managers are ofno help to customers or
bad,"it is a lot of work "
bad,"It didn't use to be so bad. This is insane. When you do what we do but then we are talk down to and dis respected or threatened based on reviews. This was a great place to work and help the customers...."
bad,"Poor management, Loss prevention accuses the employees more than the people walking out on camera with items, no advancement for current employees, they hire from outside rather than within."
bad,"Do not work at the dollar general in lexington, the manager is horrible. Since the manager has been there nobody lasts longer then 2 months. This place is always a mess walking in, Things are all over the place."
bad,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. Nothing about it is good to work for, or even be around as a customer. I have yet to be in, or work for a dollar general that is a "" good "" store to be in or around."
bad,"very fast paced and overall stress is very real part of this job. You must be able to lift large amounts of weight and open product quickly, so if this is something you are looking for this is the job for you"
bad,"If you are just looking for a part time job to make some extra cash, this job would be alright for you. "
bad,You can be bullied and harassed and management gets away with it! They expect you to work all these crazy hours but refuse over time. I loved my co workers and the job but corporate is a joke! Can’t keep a store manager or when they do they’re constantly going from store to store! Not worth it
bad,Management was terrible. High turn over. They played favorites and if you were not a favorite they changed your schedule without notice and they would take you off the schedule and not let you know. They did this to run workers off and played victims add to why the person left. Upper management didn't care as long as they looked good to corporate. I enjoyed the job I enjoyed most of the customers.didn't pay enough to deal with two faced management
bad,I Myeshia will never tell anyone about this job it is not a good place to work at all.. they don't pay enough.. they also says they have open door and when you use nothing happens they don't proceed the next action...
bad,"The managers are not very well trained, there is no training for the employees. They have you watch a couple videos on your job then call that training. The wages are low, there are no hours, and they treat you unfairly"
bad,"They don't treat employees very well. Unsafe working environment. Bad management. They will use you up and spit you out. They act like they're a charitable organization and care about people that have serious diseases,  but the moment an employee gets one, you're out the door."
bad,"This place was not a good place to work at, low pay and lots of stress due to the fact that we usually only had 2 people in the store and many times it was only 1 person working."
bad,they are all back stabbing snakes that are out for them selfs and do not care about their employees. They do not help out when there are problems you need to deal with in your family. worst job ever.
bad,"There are not enough employees on a shift. 2 employees and sometimes only 1 employee are expected to complete everything before their shift is over. There is usually only one person during rush hour at night. Because the  other person decides  to take lunch at that time. This fact was  even pointed out by Customers. Customers have to stand in long lines and wait  quite often. Sometimes the customers have to go find a employee to come to the register to assist them  them because the one or two employees are trying to get the tasks completed so that they will not be questioned or possibly coached. Employees work for almost nothing but are expected to complete the work load of at least 4 people.  Pay is so low along with hours being cut constantly.  It takes the joy out of getting paid weekly because it is literally nothing. If you enjoy getting things  accomplished ,  lower your standards because you will be stuck behind register all shift and then  you will be questioned and possibly  action taken against you because the unrealistic task list was not completed. If you are hired as assistant manager  there may possibly be a chance that you will be able to preform as one. It never happened for me. Be informed if you are assistant manager you will have no (none) (zero) authority. Yet you will be responsible for the actions of others.( Not sure if  this is policy in all locations or  this one only  ) . Please just keep looking elsewhere. This was the worst experience ever."
bad,Mid management made promises that were never met. Training is a joke. Your expected to run a store and commit to all responsibilities while you are the only person in the building ringing out customers at the register.
bad,Dollar General requires that each store employ a minimum number of hourly employees and has a cap on the number of hours each hourly employee can work.  Most employees are only allowed to work around 15 hours per week.
bad,Store was always dirty and never properly stocked. The staff didn't complete their daily tasks and many people stole from the store. There was lots of drama.
bad,Store managers are nothing more than glorified cashiers at most times.  Constantly working 6+ days a week because as the only salaried manager often it will only be you in the building when labor is cut.
bad,"This company doesn't care about the employees. Cuts hours far too often, and expects the store to run with one or two employees at a time. Turn over rate is ridiculous especially for management. Underpaid and over worked. Benefits are a joke."
bad,"They don't care about the employees, they don't have security, the cameras don't work right, and they don't consider the employees, they don't respect people."
bad,dollar general does not treat employees right. I worked in a store manager role for a year and half and was paid max assistant manager pay. max pay for an assistant manager is 12.00 an hour. my store manager was out on sick leave for over 6 months and I was left to run the store and still was not increased in pay or offered overtime
bad,I did not enjoy working here the managers were aweful and they always would work you until 39 hours to make sure you couldnt get over time and would never give you a pay raise or anything even if it was promised
bad,no matter how much u work they will not advance u they will advance someone that does less work then u. the store manager does not do things by the book and will discriminate against u if u studder or have a learning disadvantage.
bad,"a fast-paced customer service, retail job with all the joys of foul mouth customers for minimal wages and top-notch shenanigans made for the whole family!"
bad,"I am one of several team members (across the district) who were thrust into managing broken Dollar General stores, each with a backlog of work from previous management. The upper management shows no respect to any of the store managers in the district, and immediately blames old problems on the new managers after they've begun working."
bad,"Unbelievably moody people. I worked there 2 months and I've never seen so much confusion, relationship drama, severe personality disorders, family violence,  turmoil and anger management issues in one place in my life.  Everybody always griping. More like a day care center for misfits. "
bad,"I was constantly degraded by the management staff, given little instruction and when I was it was diffrent from each person, no work ethic or enthusiasm, no breaks whatsoever unless you are a smoker."
bad,"Very bad place to work. I would never recommend this job to anyone. Very fast paced, not enough help or budget to get the job done. Came in to a store that need major help, couldn't get it"
bad,Getting yelled at for being in the way when not even near the person. Belittled. I learned that my love for the job would be gone the first day. Which it was. Hardest part partially was having to check the front half of the store within a certain amount of hours if not then you would be fired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Another hardest part was trying to keep my patience which I have a lot of but this tested it to the point where I had to quit. I left within a month of being there.
bad,"Place is dirty and full of drama , the manager is horrible and doesn't do a good job . there is no security . the are barely any hours and no one does there job"
bad,This is not the job for you if you enjoy living.  It is 100% labor and cut throat.  They expect more than most and give less than most in a labor position job.
bad,"My staff was fabulous, but I was the only salaried position in the store. So I am forced towork 60 or more hours a week. Consistently for months on end and the extent of there gratitude it a literal pat on the back. My store has black mold in it, they don't care. They pulled 500 gallons of water off the floor the roof leaks so bad. The store is 4 years old. Company doesn't care about it's people just wants to make a buck."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for this company. They over work you and you get payed very poorly and on top of hat you get no type of benefits at all.
bad,Not worth your time don’t go there bad place to work they treat you wrong don’t take care of their employees try to talk to you however they like not the job for anyone
bad,I would not recommend this company to work for. Very poor management. Pay rate is awful. If manager on duty they regulate what you can do but demand you clock out. Very poor work environment.
bad,"I was offered this job with the promise of beginning classes to become a manager. A few months go by and I never started my classes, plus I found out the girl they hired just a few weeks before me was promised the same thing. The managers are lazy and use stocking as an excuse to hide in the back of the store on their phones or sneaking merchandise out the back door."
bad,my day usually started by the cash register there was always a line when i came in because no one at my store ever knew what they were doing. Then if the people before didn't finish putting things away like stocking things up front i would finish it inbetween working at the register.
bad,The  management is horrible plus the managers above the store manager won't stop them.  I recommend another job because Dollar General is pretty much cut throat
bad,"learned how to manage a store without an actual manager after our good manager left"
bad,"If you like working for less than you're are worth and working in more urban dangerous areas this job is perfect for you. Also there is a drug test required in the beginning, and for every advancement."
bad,"Dollar General is by far the worst place that I have ever worked. The store manager is an imbecile who can not complete simple day to day task without insulting customers, and not to mention employees. The lack of recoginition for going out of your way to do something was unbelievable. With drug addict co-workers and also theiving ones , the verbal abuse in front of the customers and lack of communication made this job absolutely terrible."
bad,Not good hours was promised full time and was only getting 3 days a week 5 hours a shift and the manager was so concerned about making sure herself and her daughter and close friend had the most benefits and hours instead of letting anyone else
bad,Come in and clock in and start grabbing stuff to put out from the back.  Stock until its time to go home.  Checking out people at the cash register also.
bad,"You get no support from your regional manager or above for anything. You receive no positive feedback no matter hope hard you work . Unless your a butt kisser to the higher ups!! And the pay is very low for everything they want you to do. Most of the management are rude and hateful to other employees and sometimes to customers"
bad,Horrible turnover and no-one cares about staff expect u to work around the clock for very little pay no home life u will live there and stress causes alot of health issues
bad,When I first started it was fun until drama made its way in all the way to then higher ups and they fired everybody including me just because i was in the building at the time.
bad,The Job Was completely easy. But the environment was depressing. Customers are rude for no apparent reason and management. i really enjoyed working for dollar general. wish i could've got paid more and people were nicer
bad,"Dollar General doesn’t care about their employees"
bad,"Switched management over 5 times in less than a year, over worked employees and management does not care about them. My father passed away and I was told to go home, even tho I tried to work through it and then was written up afterward. Was very ill, threw up in floor, was told to go home, waited an additional 3 hours till relief came in, then was written up a week later. Bad Managment!"
bad,"As a manager I worked 80-90 hours a week, I was immediately put in to a problem store after training and didn't see my DM for 2 months and never got any help or guidance."
bad,"no work/life balance....only work more, no pay.  DM made store manager work alone, highly dangerous.  Reported, corporate did nothing and DM continued same behavior.  Company condones poor treatment of employees. Low pay, expensive benefits, promises promotions, never follows through with promises, and DM's have no prior store management experience."
bad,"Days were busy, too much work and not enough help. DM cheated me on salary after I took managers job. DM cut hours for store every week and all the other stores had to make up the difference"
bad,"interview By store manager, he was ready to offer me a Job. the DM didn't approve, I have the credentials. Discrimination. Didn't get a chance to pass"
bad,"Just don't work there. I was sexually harassed by a Store manager, witnessed employees stealing, customers steal. They could not keep a Store Manager for longer than a couple weeks. I was promoted to co manager with the promise of a pay increase that never came. They refused to promote me further, when the store had no leadership. I was told I did not fit in."
bad,"Dollar Gener makes it very clear that they are more focused on everything and anything that isn’t their employees and while sometimes understandable, it’s quite frustrating. I’ve put many hours into my work and received nothing in return. The system at Dollar General is out of date and needs an update. Every Dollar General I’ve gone to is seriously understaffed and not a great environment."
bad,"This is a place you should only work if you're fresh out of high school. It will show you very early that some companies are just not working for."
bad,A good place if you want part time hours with minimum wage. Don't expect much help or integrity from the managerial staff. There is not enough help for closing staff and expectations are unreasonably high.
bad,You would be alone from 8am until the next person came in at 12 or sometimes 1. You would have to do resets and ring and check in vendors alone. This made the job a little more stressful.
bad,Do not work here pay is not good for all the work you are required to do. District managers do not care and neither does the store managers. No benefit package
bad,the same thing every day. the management had no clue what they were doing. nothing was hard. the best part was getting to meet all the different people
bad,"The one job I wish I had never taken. Working here filled my heart ....at the beginning. Once promoted to Store Manager after 2 years of employment the life was sucked out of me. Corporate asks too much of their managers which trickles down to the store associates. Stay under budget meant cutting hours from hourly paid employees and sadly seniority rules meant that the highest paid hourly employee got their house cut. Low moral from the District Manager and an unwillingness to accomodate employees for family emergencies or illness. Basically...even if you are DEAD, they still want you to clock in"
bad,Not a great work life balance or advancement opportunities. I was promised a position only to have it given to someone else that does not meet any requirements
bad,"I was the assistant store manager, and I was also responsible for the entire perishables department. I was never given the resources I needed to do my job properly. While responsible for ordering, rotating, stocking and receiving all frozen and cold food I was also responsible for the day to day operations of the store including cash management and deposits, opening and closing the store, creating schedules, handling customer sales and complaints, personnel, and stocking non perishable freight."
bad,"this was a male chauvinistic work place, my hours were changed I was only paid $80 a week. had to close every night knowing I was in school and had a small child at home."
bad,"Stressful and many who worked there suspect the Manager was very Bias and racist."
bad,"good job fun customers, I don't really know what to say, not much life balance with this job, long hours, hard physical labor, tough management, micro managed, no fun in store, rude vendors"
bad,"I worked for the 14988 store in western grove. Management sucks, the pay sucks. I hated it there. They leave all the freight for the one or two people and it's a teribble work place."
bad,Management was worthless had to run round after them to get anything done they would usually be outside smoking or hiding somewhere. Didnt learn anything i didnt already know. job was easy other than customers who are rude and management who are worthless. most enjoyable thing was going home at the end of the day.
bad,"Poor management, poor schedule planning, no benefits or discounts, they usually keep a ghost crew of 1 or 2 barley trained people and it's almost impossible to advance and get a promotion"
bad,"DM is not nice underminds you and makes you feel like you dont know how to do your job. Never has anything good to say."
bad,I enjoyed my time at dollar General but when your a PT sales associate at 7.25 and your barely getting 20hrs and you have a child you can't live on that.Im the type were I have to do better it eats at me like a Cancer if I don't.If you are a serious about a career this is not the place for you.
bad,"If you want first hand experience of hard work without any benefit. Work here, and you'll most likely be the only one working. The customers are the fun part because at least then it's different people. This company is the absolute worst."
bad,I hate this job. They want you to stop people from stealing. They always get robbed and don't have sercurity. They pay is $8 a hr but needs to be $15.
bad,"they do not respect their employees."
bad,This job was very physical and hard for a woman. There was a lot of lifting and walking involved. I had to leave home at 3:30 am to make it to work on time and did not get home until after 7 pm everyday
bad,"I was a store manager for Dollar General. The company is very cut throat! My DM would not work with you. I loved to work there in the begining, but over time my desire to work there decreased."
bad,"They schedule 1 employee to be in the store per shift. Very dangerous and hard to stock, monitor shrink, unlock the bathrooms, and cashier all at the same time. Many weeks I did not get paid. It took me quitting to get my back pay. Horrible company I would not recommend to anyone. Extremely high turn over rate. Rude employees and management does nothing when you complain."
bad,"bad pay, bad management,bad working conditions,no communication from management, no information or training when anything changed so unable to either explain or help customers when needed"
bad,Sorriest job I've ever had. If you are not in the right group of people they don't want you there. Want one person to do all the work. Management would get mad if you needed help.
bad,"This was one of the absolute worst jobs I've ever had in my life.  There is no work life balance, only work.  The salaried employees are taken advantage of very badly."
bad,Management was not trained properly. District managers didn't care about what went on in the company as long as the doors were open and customers were shopping.
bad,Not safe and they don't care about employers . They tell you you getting paid for over time and never pay over time cause no one get 40 hours but the Store Manager.
bad,terrible not worth the stress very unorganized don't care about their employees health or safety extremely high turn around rate poor communication and pay
bad,This job was very poor. Average hours were 18-20 hours. Management with the exception of very few was horrible. Advancement was non-existent. Selection process to advance in my opinion was political in nature.
bad,Everything in that company needs an upgrade . Management for one. It's there way or no way.and your work you do is not good enough and they will push you out.
bad,My biggest complaint is that there is only me and the as. Manager here with keys. It's really hard on both of us. I had a miscarage and still had to come into work sick because we have no one to cover for us.
bad,"This has hands done been the worst job I’ve ever worked.. just very unorganized, rude management and much much more. Can’t even go on to describe what kind of environment was there."
bad,they expect you to do way to much on top of being cashier management sucks and they will work you like a dog for little to no pay and the DM for dollar general in my area needs to be fired
bad,not a fun place to work at all. Do not treat employees right and the pay is not worth the work they have to do.  They do not give enough payroll for the work they expect you to do.
bad,I do not recommend anyone work for this company it is horrible as a part time key holder i was made to clock out on my 30minute to an hour lunch but still had to perform duties as manager during my off the clock meals.
bad,"Rude managers, terrible clutter in the store, always get complaints about the clutter. Needs to remodel or get a bigger building or have someone hired on that knows how to order stock right."
bad,They don't appreciate their workers and they expect for them to do three and four things at one time. They make you open the store all by yourself most days and that is extremely dangerous. There are never enough employees on the clock and they have ridiculous policies.
bad,Would not recommend working here. I worked here for 6 months before i decided to quit. Store got robbed during the shift I worked and management wasn't around. I was left alone while they were in the back.
bad,They do not allocate enough hours for the employees to accomplish job duties; cut hours constantly and then complain or reprimand because things are not getting done in a timely manner. Work you to death for terrible pay
bad,It's not a place to make a career out of. They only pay 8.00. And expect for you to work harder. I only work there part time. Looking for another job. Can't live off 8.00.
bad,managment chris very rude very mean wont help out at all just not a good district manager other store not as bad just my district manager other dollar stores out of his district are awsome
bad,They treat their managers like animals.  They don't know how to talk to you.  The pay was nowhere near what you should be paid for the amount of hours you have to work.  And if you are over budget they tell you to send your employee home and as the store manager you have to stay by yourself to make up the budget.
bad,Horrible environment. The managers act like it is not a team environment when in fact it is. District managers tries to get the store managers to complete unrealistic goals and its not fair.
bad,Its ok if you are just looking for part time job. Not a good choice if you are looking to build a career in retail. They are all about making a dollar verses putting their workers first.
bad,"I would not recommend working at Dollar General. Management is awful; scheduled me to work and never notified me it changed. Mangers will talk bad about you behind your back. The schedule would constantly change or wouldn't be put up until the day before the schedule began. Also, they would not tell you if they changed the schedule, which typically happened ten minutes before the shift started, and with my experience this happen with every shift. Not given any hours, hours go to favorites."
bad,Horrible company horrible pay horrible building  horrible place horribleness manabers horrible customers horrible pay and horrible training horrible horribleness horrible
bad,"poor management caused stressful workplace, enjoyed working with customers and co-workers, however,  the general  manager did not have good people skills"
bad,This peckerwoods don't want black people working inside here your pay is high but if you don't get the hrs that pay don't mean nothing they petty managers lie majority of them only certain ppl allowed to cuss... Don't work here but then again go see for yourself
bad,A very low paying company that does not care about their employees. I would not recommend this place or go back. They hire any one and then expect you to work yourself to death to make up for the less favorable employees.
bad,"I was mistreated, and the store/workers are just a mess and disorganized."
bad,"There's a person that gets away with every thing down to not showing up to work, the require clothes. He doesn't have very good very good hygiene. He doesn't have to wear arm deodorant. I just don't understand how and why this type of stuff happens.. "
bad,"They will work you to death with no regard for the associate and let others by with doing very little. They lie about advancement."
bad,Dollar general never has enough employees the lines are 10-15 minutes long. They are dirty and unorganized for the lack of employees......................
bad,"I basically worked alone every day doing everything in the store, while everyone else took credit with upper management. My hard workers were unacknowledged. It was the slackers and those conducting employee theft that were able to advance. Management just feeds off of the lower positions efforts and then once the store is where they need it to be so they can keep their jobs, finds petty ways to get rid of the ones who could ever surpass them or take their current position."
bad,Was hired full time as a key holder and promised full time hours until district manager brought in an assistant manager without notifying store manager until after i was hired.
bad,"I got fired for being in a car accident just the other day!  I was in the hospital and they fired me for being in bad shape the manager needs to be fired. They need to close down the store all together. Who fired someone who was injured and couldn't come into work. "
bad,I was hired to be an assistant manager and never was never given the training and eventually was told I was being demoted to a part-time cashier with a reduction in pay
bad,working for the company dollar general was stressful I felt as if I was never able to get a day and catch up to my sleep or was never able to get anything out of work done I was very stressed
bad,I was really excited about the opportunity at DG. but quickly realized what a nightmare it was!! the DM is a horrible person! she was the main reason I bailed! work between 50-70 hours a week on salary pay!! you would be lucky to get one day a week off!! and even that one day was spent dealing with store issues. under staffed. impossible to get everything done and help customers. a lot of the time there was only one person working! I could go on but I wont!
bad,"Poor manager-management  manager liked you you got a few extra hours a week, if not always had to work evening shifts til closing and at least every Saturday"
bad,It was a good job first starting out. The manager was very self absorb and all around rude. She had no respect for her employees. The company is good to work for as long as you have the right manager.
bad,Not enough staff they under pay you and work long hours. They expect women to lift very heavy boxes and items without any help. Would never work here again!
bad,"Inconsistent work hours, poor management, low pay, no job benefits."
bad,You work 60 hours a week. You work until at least 10:00am by yourself.. It is very stressful. They require so much to be done without any help. You are a highly paid stockman. You work 6 days a week. You don't get sick pay.
bad,"Being a store manager at Dollar General be prepare not to have a personal life at you will be at the store more than home with your family, missing important events and Upper management will call or text you none stop"
bad,"I worked at Dollar General for 6 months and during this time I had 4 different managers, 2 district managers and a short period of  time there was not a manager.The store was closed by the fire department twice."
bad,"Cashier helping people find things they cant find."
bad,"the stealing and robbery is just unblieveable , literally happens 6 hours maybe of your 8 hour shift"
bad,They have no respect for their workers. I was always being put down and berated in front of customers. Management has no people stills at all. Management has no respect for anyone
bad,"The company DOES NOT care for its employees, they pay $7.50 starting and it would take a while to get payed anymore than that. The manager was HORRIBLE she was substituting real $100 dollar bills for fake ones and then would blame cashiers when banks didn't accept them. The stores have high turnover rates. This job is good for high school student looking for first job but if possible find a better one."
bad,"They treated people like dogs. If you needed help, management basically told you that their was no one that they could spare also they yelled at you if you got behind"
bad,this is the worst company I have ever worked for in my life they expect so much out of their employees and they don't pay nothing but 8.00 an hour maybe if you have experience
bad,"CURRENT EMPLOYEE (ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER)"
bad,"Wouldn't recommend. You get zero benefits, pay is low, workload is high, and hours suck. The company treats their employees poorly, and so does my store manager and coworkers"
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. The conditions are terrible and upper management is only focused on numbers, instead of what's best for the store itself."
bad,The management was very poor. They wanted you to do everything they were supposed to so they didn't have to do it. Horrible experience. Do not recommend.
bad,Not very good management but I still managed to work and complete my job for the day. I really loved helping customers that was my priority daily to provide good customer service.
bad,"This corporation makes it's money at your expense.  Highly regulated from the corporate level for minimum expense, maximum profit. Not in the best interests of the customer, the staff or even the store itself. They will require you to meet goals but not allow the payroll hours to do it. Only two people can work at a time, sometimes only one person in the store.  If you are a hard worker they will chew you up and spit you out. You'll just be replaced with another sucker. Sad. I cannot recommend employment in this company."
bad,Employees are overworked until they quit. Pay is low and wildly inconsistent from one store to the next. I had five district managers in four years. The last one's anti-Semitic remarks finally prompted me to quit. A former co-worker of mine was murdered in her store because the company pushed her to cut payroll and provided no store security.
bad,working at dollar general was the worst. Long days with only one cashier and a store full of people. They didn't pay good at all. You did a lot of work for minimum wage.
bad,"The management is bad. I would not recommend working at Dollar General to anyone. They do not treat their employees well. "
bad,"In a typical workday I would stock shelves, and cashier. Would not be kept up to date about anything going with the store. I would not recommend this job because managers don't treat any employees fairly."
bad,My manager sucked. Single mom with 2 kids and they wouldn't compromise my schedule so i could he home at night with my children. My co-workers were rude and had poor work ethic as well.
bad,I feel that they should trust people and because you been their so many years I dont think that they should get rid of you like they been doing because of what someone else did and it was out of your control
bad,"I was paid .25 less than a basic cashier to have the responsibility of the management team. Hours were unfair, management never worked nights and were off by 3-4 pm everyday."
bad,very busy never had time to stock the shelves wait on customers get truck loads done very poor management no help there was only 5 of us that worked there no help very long days
bad,Hardest part of the job was being paid minimum wage and being expect to unload an entire truck by yourself within a weekend and not getting paid whatsoever near the amount any other job would for the same position.
bad,"Stores time management was terrible, they wanted you to complete a 2 hour task in 1 hour. They hired higher postions from outside of the store not from within."
bad,My experience there was pretty rough after the robbery I worked at least 9 nights shifts by myself! Before I was relocated from my own store working there was ok
bad,I wouldn't want to go back to work there unless I was the manager but overall the company does NOT care about anyone overstock under staff no organization
bad,"It's not a  company I would recommend to my worst enemy.  It's very stressful, you work off the clock often. Management says one thing does the complete opposite."
bad,Do not work here. It is the worst place I have ever worked at. Management is poor and they will get mad at you for not completing work there is no way you could accomplish in one night. I should’ve never took the job.
bad,"Management chooses it's favorite employees and treat them the best while the rest of the staff, who are far more better workers are treated very ill.."
bad,Dollar general was an okay company to work for. They helped me get through school. Although it was okay I do not see myself ever going back. Too much work with not enough pay.
bad,Some members of management were good and knew what they were doing but the store manager and the GM had no idea on how to treat employees and especially not customers.
bad,"It was bad, expected to do one job and did three other jobs during the main job. Unorignized, Underpaid, lucky if you have a nice manager. and have fun w 8.05 an hour."
bad,"the manager is very unprofessional, some employees on drugs, and a lack of respect for customers who come in on a daily basis. not a clean store especially the floors . very unorganized ."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here, I was treated unfairly, and fired for no reason. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with someone not liking you, so they go for your job. Yes I am a little bitter"
bad,Refer to my summary. You are loaded with work and not paid nearly enough for the amount of work that is expected of you. Managers get paid about 8 bucks an hour. Not worth it in my opinion.
bad,The manager was always grumpy and expected to much to be done in too little time. She would start several projects a day and then leave them incomplete and on the floor taking up space in the way of customers. Not many of the customers had nice things to say either.
bad,I do not like DG because the people a and the way they treat their employees. I do not recommend this company at all. Tgey do not care about their employees and health
bad,"Worst place ever to work at. Store managers are very rude. District managers are worse. No discounts, short breaks and lunches. Was full time but never got 40 hours a week"
bad,The manager was poor. The hours sucked. The pay sucked. I had to teach myself. I knew alot more than the manager. It's a stressful job to have if you already struggling
bad,"Dollar General was an income but it will likely depend on the supervisor and employees that work there as any other job.  The interaction with customers is great as you may help some customers find items as there may be regular customers on a daily basis, which for me was the best part of the job."
bad,I would never recommend to anyone being in management for this company.  The workload on the manager of each store is astronomical and never compensated correctly.  I opened 5 stores and was the manager of 7.  Never again.
bad,an easy place to work. Not a job to make a career out of. Management was never that good. Co-workers were nice. Job required more work than they are willing to pay for.
bad,I was put in a store that was in bad shape.I worked 60 to 70 hours every week and did not receive any help from my district manager. I did not receive the required training that I was suppose to get. My employees and myself were getting threatened by customers to the point one brought a gun in the store looking for myself. Nothing was done about any of the threats. Poor company to work for.
bad,You'll be asked to do more hat your job title requires. You won't be treated fairly. You'll be stuck doing other peoples jobs on a regular basis. The only good thing is the customer connections.
bad,"i hated dealing with a boss that didnt do nothing about a problem and the turn out why people stop working there i can see why t hey dont train you right at all and they think you can get use to things in a week or so and the boss i had would chew your butt for something you didnt do,"
bad,"I understand that each dollar General is different but i wouldn't recommend anyone to work there, it is a horrible place to work and their managers have no idea what real management skills are"
bad,"I've worked in retail at a place like this before so I thought I knew what to expect but the final straw for me was that they expect you to work long shifts (extended store hours) on holidays and don't give time and a half (no holiday pay) as well as not providing even a benefit option for the part-time employees. Management was absolutely awful where I worked, so it could be better, but Dollar General as a corporation is failing their employees. They also require you to take an hour lunch when you work longer than 7 hours (so they don't have to pay you as much) and most employees end up working on the second half of their lunch. I was once told that I would have to meet up with another associate on my time off because I had to share my store keys, so a lot of illegal activity goes on here and they will take advantage of you, if you're the type of person that doesn't/can't say no."
bad,"Horrible place to work manager talked bad about all the employees and was really rude to customers. I worked at one in El Paso, Tx and the management was horrible and higher management did nothing about the incident."
bad,the experience i had at DG was not a good one..long hours no pay no help. complaint after complaint  they dont treat their loyal employees fair very cut throat with high turnover rates
bad,Management sucks. the whole place is a joke .this is literally the worst place i have ever worked for. befor hand i was warned not to work here but thought i would give in a try because i cant be as bad as people say but no its horrible!
bad,My manager would send me and a few other coworkers to the nearest Dollar General Store which was her best friend store and we weren't being paid there.
bad,The manager does nothing but sit in the office on the computer or goes out to smoke. Once in awhile you will see her on the sales floor but that is long enough to yell at an employee or to cover for a break or lunch.
bad,"Dollar General was a very unsafe place. It requires you to work way harder than what they are paying you to do, and they also have you doing assignments that are not in your job title, such as manager duties."
bad,I learned from working here that if you want more hours you have to know the manager and also be able to work when ever they call you. I only received 14 hours a week while working here
bad,"Management was awful. I was the Asst. manager at my store on Remembrance and had achieved the role quickly by working my butt off. My store manager took advantage of this. The moment you show you're a good/hard worker they steamroll you. I was working 60 hour weeks getting paid for 35. had to work on my breaks in order to complete everything that needed done because nobody else would do their jobs. Do NOT work for Dollar General, such a waste. I had to teach/train myself because management couldn't be bothered to train me.... My experience was so poor I don't even shop there anymore. Save your effort, work ANYWHERE else."
bad,This company cares nothing about the employee. The work place is unsafe. They ask you to do work outside of your job title. No room for advancement. All around awful work environment.
bad,"this place was a dump. nothing can compare to what i had to go through. The boss was a jerk. I had to work all the hours while the boss was ""sick"" for 2 months straight."
bad,It's ok if you like being confuses they change things every time you turn around they say they have open door policy it's not true you can try but goes now where
bad,Poor management and takes advantage of over working or hardly working employees. No employee incentives. Non flexible hours with employees with families.
bad,"Dollar General was a t great job to work at it’s located in Indianola,ms, 38751"
bad,"The manager who hired me got caught stealing two deposits and vanished.  The assistant manager was caught stealing from cashiers tils.  The cashiers were fired instead of her.  Eventually the district manager figured that out.  It was a horrible, stressful, and undermanaged location."
bad,The manager would only give you 5 hours a week so she could work the rest of them herself. Then when the salary changed for her she started recording her as working a shift when she didn't even work that shift.
bad,I have never worked for a company that was so beyond racial. I am a white female that is 59 years old and encountered racism in everything I did. Nothing was ever good enough. Poor training and when not trained written up for not doing my job. Unfair to me and as an assistant manager received no respect from coworkers at this job.
bad,Would give your schedule 1day before new one comes out. Would tell her you can not work a certain day and she schedules u. No training at all. Thrown to the wolves. Would discuss associates problems with other associates.
bad,"Worked 6 days a week, never the same schedule, pay for awful for entry level management in the area, ridiculous expectations for work output when store has two people working, you being one of them. "
bad,the manager there favorite young girls over the other employees and you have to get train by customer that work there before the manager just tells you to stock shelves or run register you don't a full understand of your position responsibilities
bad,"I cannot stand this place. Management is terrible and we cannot keep employees. Every time the manager hires people, she has to cut everyone else's hours. This causes her to lose more people. I have been there for over a year. We have gone through three managers. I have gotten one raise/promotion and I only got that because I told them I was ready to walk out. I cannot wait to quit!"
bad,Nothing good to say about the company or its management. Under paid and under staffed. Very unorganized for such a large chain store. Really have nothing more to say
bad,A day at Dollar General can be very busy and challenging sometimes.  You not only have customers to ring up but you have stock and recover and displaying ads.
bad,the dollar general i was at was not a very good one. it was poorly run and had to call in every single day to see if i had to work. it may be better now as it is under new management.
bad,"They are a company filled with the most deplorable people you will ever meet. they have no respect for their employees or their customers. And if someone decides to call corporate and tell them a lie about an employee, the claim is never investigated, and the employee will get a write up without any chance to defend themselves."
bad,Management made this job very hard for me. I worked here for 3yrs before I finally had the guts to leave and go back to school. Started school so I would never have to work for a management team like this job.
bad,"The only reasons I stayed on as long as I did was for the regular customers, and because I couldn't find another job. We were always understaffed, never enough hours to go around, and no one but the store manager was allowed to be full time. I only got my promotion because another keyholder had recently quit, and the other one suggested it to the store manager. Otherwise, they would've hired from outside. They never hire within if they can help it."
bad,You work to job load of 2-3 people with no recognition or advancement. Bad management and back stabbing. Too much work load and not enough staff or hours to complete anything
bad,"Working at Dollar General is not a great place to work at. It has poor management, the hours were poor. They wanted you to do more than you were able too."
bad,there training is horrible they hire anyone off the street and don't care about our safety etc leaving us alone to work for hours alone.. low pay for the work they make you do
bad,"Unrealistic expectations wanted truck merchandise to be completely stocked with 2 days while working register, and monitoring store from theft. management was barely there to help or assist. overworked and under paid."
bad,The store was and still is a mess but in order to get it in tip top shape they need management  typical day is none stop stocking trying to down all back stock
bad,the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and unsatisfied customers due to not being able to find anything in the store because of disorganized and out of order shelfs
bad,"Management is horrible.  If you have a problem with a manager, corporate will place the blame on you.  I didnt agree with my store manager, because she would talk about everyone to other employees, so I called corporate.  They told her not to do it again.  She continued, and created a hostile work environment.  Any one that complains is forced to quit."
bad,I would not recommended working at the dollar general in edgewood plaza in nicholasville ky. Management is awful and will cut your hours big time. He was rude and very sexist and pretty much got rid of all the guys there including my self.  All he wanted was an all girl workers. The back break room is a mess and the manager doesnt kno what he is doing half the time. He shouldnt even be manager. He isnt management material
bad,"Stock, help customers, and expected to get more work done than any one person can do in the few 4 hours you are scheduled. Customers come first but are not treated well. Employees are not allowed any overtime, must have someone with a key to do basic things like taking something off of an order. Most weeks only scheduled for 15 hours at most and 12 at the least. Most days are only 4 hours of work without the benefit of being treated as a person. You are a number, dispensable, and will not be treated as anything but a temporary fixture. The enjoyable part of this job is the customers you get to interact with on a daily basis."
bad,"Noone pays attention, workers treated poorly and taken for granted. Problems never taken care of. No professionalism. Over worked under paid. Never again"
bad,"Manager harassed me personally and at work.  Her family did as well outside of work. Because I had filed harassment with the company, my manager rigged my schedule the last two weeks and made it appear as if I did not attend work."
bad,Under paid for expected work and management does not address needs or problems within the work place INCLUDING harassment  and over all just a very poor work environment.
bad,management is laughable and never get 40 hours. Good job for a young person who has no bills. Not a livable wage in this day and time. They do not care about you or your family.
bad,If you want a low paying job where everyone is talking about you including you manager then this is the right job for you. The only people who like working there are the ones who are getting paid $12-$14 dollars and hour and that only a hand full of people.
bad,"the pay, management, and overall experience was HORRIBLE. would never recommend to anyone. you could make more money panhandling then working there for 7.25."
bad,dollar general is the worst company I have ever worked for. hours cut all the time and no one can live on 20 hours or less a week. managers were not bad corporate will not allow them to give out hours. while the one year I worked there I had 5 different managers I had 3 different district and regional managers no one stays with the company long not even people in corporate field one of the most stingiest companies ive ever come across.
bad,Management sucks. District manager doesnt care. Store is always a mess. Employees come and go as they please. Only paid me for part-time but was working me full time.
bad,"Over worked and under paid for what they want you to do. Truck days come with anywhere from 1000-1450 pieces  and they expect it to be out on the sales floor in 21/2 days, with VERY MINIMUM LABOR. On top of that you have to reset the different seasonal items  when the seasons change and once again minimum labor to do that. Yes this companies should take care of their customers but they should also take care of their workers this company is so concerned about internal theft when they really don't do anything about all the external theft from the customers."
bad,The manager would appoint employees to stock shelves as well as check customers out. There wasn't enough employees hired per shift to get all the work done. The manager would just stand and watch employees work. I would work 8 hour shifts without a  break or a lunchbreak sometimes.
bad,Hiring people that are not dependable and poor management.  Most enjoyable is working with the public and helping people. To much drama in the work place.
bad,"	Stocked the shelves"
bad,Dollar general is the worst place to work. The employees are under payed and over worked. I had to be the opening manager and closing manager. Most times I was by myself.
bad,"Bad managment of time and resources from higher management causes problems for all employees. Company is to concerned with doing things quickly then correctly. Overall bad management in store and on a district level as well. Schedule is never consistent, lunches always vary, management works off clock. Bad labor."
bad,"Management would not do anything but complain about things not getting done cause of lack of employees."
bad,The manager at the Centralia location along with under management really sucked.  They did not have enough employees to cover shifts and if you tried to help you were a troublemaker
bad,"Enjoyed working with my former associates. Management however was an issue for me. The store was a mess, no organization or leadership skills. The entire store was a safety hazard."
bad,"This was by far the worst place I have ever worked. Management is completely inept and unsupportive, Many of my managers even stole from the company and were just transferred to other stores if employees became suspicious. I was entirely overworked and underpaid. I worked there while pregnant and was often made to work for 6+ hours entirely alone even though our store had been robbed several times. Rules and procedures for everything changed constantly. One day you would get written up for taking too many coupons and the next you would be written up for upsetting a customer by not taking all of their coupons. In the year that I worked there I had 6 different managers because the good ones left for better jobs and the bad ones just went to other stores. The customers were so rude, on more than one occasion I had customers actually throw things at me and we were expected to just stand there and take it . There was no chance for real advancement, they just gave you more responsibilities and expectations but found technicalities to avoid giving raises. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,Managers are unwilling to give positive work/life balance. They do not give room for improvement and overall just a really bad place to work. My manager did not care about her employees and clearly used favoritism when dealing with scheduling and employee disciplinary actions.
bad,"Typically, due to the high attrition rate we were in a constant merry go round of training, losing people and retaining, only to lose those people. The company is a high stress, high physical, high mental energy job and the company demands maximum work for minimum pay, "
bad,Very poor rain people need help and the manger need help u hire female that have butt and want to do tasty stuffwith them if they dont u threathen them they job really unprofessional people really need help
bad,"Workers are forced to work off the clock, and hours will be changed to keep from having to pay employees overtime. Schedule changes will be made the day before or day of shifts and be told it’s mandatory to show up. Employees left in the store alone for up to 9 hours at a time. Terrible company, terrible management, terrible policies, terrible benefits and unfair pay."
bad,"I started working at dollar general about 3 years ago because I really needed a job. Over the course of me being there we could never keep workers or managers very long. The environment is stressful, many of the customers were unsatisfied about their experiences and nothing was ever done. I like customers to leave satisfied and with a smile on their face. Dollar general os just not a very good place to work."
bad,Dollar General was not a good job to work at. When I first started it was great and my manager was awesome. I had to change stores due to school and was quite a change the store I transferred to had only four people including me were working there.
bad,Employees are under paid. The managers can do what they want when they want. The only people that get vacation days or pay raises are the ones that befriend the manager. Managers will cut your hours if you  make them mad.
bad,"They have poor customer service skills. Prices are always wrong. Not the type of people you would want to be around. They are very unprofessional. gegb,wlv,"
bad,I was not fond of the tyrannical style of management and constant berating over every little mistake. I do not like how everything we do is driven by the purpose of increasing the company's profits at the expense of any higher values or principles that you may hold. It is a sad world where you are forced to put on a mask of passivity and force yourself to oblige every order you are given by your 'superiors' or the costumers while repressing any true feeling you may have. The corporate landscape is a psychological dungeon of torture; it stinks.
bad,The only thing enjoyable about working in the stores were the customers.  The pay is low and the workload expected is too much for one person.  Management refuses to staff enough people so there's never any progress and communication between upper management and hourlys is non existent.  Poor benefits
bad,I worked there to get out of the fast food industry. I work all the hours i could. If you get sick easily or is dealing whit stuff its your fault. I got kicked out of my house and could not leave to get my stuff after my shift.
bad,Not a good environment to work. unattainable goals.Labor guideline's and hours for productive labor not enough to perform tasks.Customer service not enough priority.
bad,I didn't think it was a great place to work at all! The store had people in positions that couldn't even handle the level beneath them more or less a manager position.
bad,"This place drains you with very little pay and no days off. They want you to work but not pay you enough money. No life outside of work, Management only cares about themselves."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for DG; unless you have a great team to work with. You do. It get any discounts for anything and no paid holidays unless you are full time.
bad,"stressful, management,  awful, terrible, long hours and not fully staff, high turn over rate, some of the customers were great, but  i would not recommend anybody for that job"
bad,Slow paced but my General Manager was accused of stealing and I didn’t receive my paycheck at the last dollar general location I worked at. The thriving GM kept giving me the run around so I quit but the other locations were fine
bad,I worked at Dollar General and they have you working extremely hard for minimum pay.  It was not worth it at all.  I wouldn't recommend people to work here.
bad,Don’t go there you will hate it long hours management will treat like a machine no life balance i worked there almost 6 years and got to leave because the long hours
bad,"nothing good to say."
bad,Very unfair about moving people up within the company they go outside of the work place. I would never work for them again. no body knows whats going on are how to fix a problem.
bad,"workers are treated unfair and also like they are worthless, a lot of things are overlooked in the store i worked at. they dont treat full time collage students fairly. i never worked more then 2 days a week very often."
bad,"You were required to work the register alone, key holder would be the only one else working with you, and rarely came up to help because Dollar General wants an impossible amount of work done by each person in a given shift, with the amount of merchandise they carry and the lack of appropriate amount of staff to achieve their expectations, they are poor at recognition, advancement, raises, or maintaining a consistant staffing due to the way in which you are treated while there. Management was poor, Everything was hard about the job, nothing I found enjoyable about it."
bad,"They make it a VERY hostile work environment and management will retaliate against you if you question something or put in an employee complaint, even though it is against company policy and corporate will not step in to help. There are supposed to be policies and procedures in place, but half the store managers DO NOT follow those, yet they will write up employees that they have any kind of personal issue with."
bad,I was on my final write according to.the manager but i was never written up once.the whole time i.worked.there. it was very unorganized no communication at all everyone did what they wanted to do.
bad,Management is needs improvement. There is no communication between the management and employees. The management doesn't see when there is a severe problem in the work place.
bad,Dollar general lets very arogant people be the managers. They don't care about the  employees. Most  employees  are rude to the customers. Also most employees just play on their phones.
bad,"I have worked at two dollar generals in completely different areas and both were terrible to work at and made you do work that is out of your pay grade and refuse to give any one raises. will work you hard and then give you other workers work if you work well. Not flexible at all and never enough workers for the hours because everyone hates working for the company,. Get absolutely no benefits not even a store discount. Most managers have no idea how to run a store. Forgets to give workers breaks and also makes you not take a break because workers from previous shift didn't finish and it has to be done by the end of your shift now.  Do not properly train new people"
bad,"Don't work here they treat you like dirt. They don't pay well, There is a lot of cut throat.. The stores are horrible.. The employees are rude.. There is not really much benfits.."
bad,New Manager unsure of how to speak to employees and poor scheduling  outrageous expectations for employees from upper management Manager did not hold all personnel accountable for their actions.
bad,"They expect all lot from you when only paying minimum wage. Only have 1 or 2 people to cover a whole store, which are packed already. told to push for higher average transactions but there is no compensation for doing so."
bad,It was a terrible place to work at. You always overworked and they never had enough workers there to help cover. And it was so hard to keep the place clean
bad,"manger needs to take a shower couple of times a week,,,she stinks all the time,,,bad ,,,,make u sick,,,i dont work there,,but everytime i go there ,,,she smells so bad,,,her name starts with a y,,,i think she is living there too,,,,i go by that place at all hours...and her car is there,,,,manger livng in the dollar general...the other people working there are just great,,,overall they need a new manger..."
bad,working at dollar general was the worst job ever we at least for me. it was super stressful and overwhelming! we didn't even have enough coworkers at the store location I was at.
bad,very poor management and not a good chance for advancement. the supervisors are hard to work with and don't like to take suggestions from employees who are there everyday
bad,"At this place, they try to advance you fast to a position called Lead Sales Associate so they can give you terrible hours at only $8 an hour. You will carry the load of a real assistant manager but WITHOUT THE PAY OR BENEFITS."
bad,"Was only given 120 hrs a week to run my store, 40 for my assistant manager, 40 for my head cashier, which left me 40 for, for all other employees, there would be times when i ran store by myself from open to close,only enjoyable part of job was that i lived 2 minutes away."
bad,"Just overall poor management. They are inconsistent with their schedules, it changes upwards to 5 times a week with no warning. There is too much drama between employees and they are treated unfairly."
bad,I hated  working at Dollar General. Its either there way or the highway. I asked before I quit if I would be given a  pay raise. Store Manager said there would be no pay raises. There is room for advancement if you full fill their requirements for management.
bad,"I left because the management was terrible, and the hours were terrible. I would not recommend this place to a friend ever. In fact, I warn against this place."
bad,"Stressful and unrewardimg for your hard work, they discriminate and play high school favorites....  Even when you bust your butt for them they clique up and will write you up for stupid Lil things to get rid of you while the favorite can be 200 short on deposit and not get written up"
bad,"Dollar General is a low managed company. It's ran poorly and understaffed, also bad customers. It's really a quick job to have for a while before you move on to another job."
bad,"i stocked shelves did truck assisted customers in the store cleanliness cash handling. i did not care for management or the environment, i enjoyed seeing the customers everyday"
bad,This job is not for the light hearted. You work your full shift non-stop. They don't like you taking breaks even though they are mandatory. Very high stress job. Management does not work well with the employees. You are worked hard and paid little.
bad,I really didn't like it at all wasn't fair pay wasn't right and management wasn't what they were supoost to be and I feel like they would favor people.
bad,"This was a bad place to work, not enough hours unless ur willing to travel to other stores. Management is bad and was constantly blaming people for not getting things done when it's super busy and you have little to no help. They start you at $8 an hour with no benefits and no bonuses in the future. You have to be able to run the cash register and stock at the same time which is very hard when ur busy.  If you close the store you are required to not only be on the register till close but recover the whole store and clean before you can leave. It's a bad place to work. No worth the headache that it will give you."
bad,"There the cash register, now run it.  There was no break room, ice box or microwave.  On break you can go visit the store next door. There resatrooms were nicer or sit on the bench outside."
bad,Ran cash register stocked shelf's. Helped customers with things off the top shelf. Cleaned the store took out the trash. Took racks off sidewalks and anything else that we had out there
bad,I hated going to work because we never knew if our management is in a good mood or not. And the management hires mainly Spanish speaking friends and family and they get most of the hours and then the rest of the employees have to work the shifts and hours that are left over. Not a fun or fair place to work. Looking for new job.
bad,Dont schedule enough associates.. store always cluttered  .. did not pay enough for the work they wanted done.. managers were ignorent and picked favorites .was guranteed 40 hours a week .never worked above 33 hours
bad,everything about dollar general is unfair they are very cuthroat it is very unpaid and they work you like slaves and the store manger dont do anything but put work on employees and take the credit for it
bad,Nothing but drama...dm and other managers do not care about the store or the employees. The customers hate going in there. The store has gone down hill since getting rid of good employee's.
bad,Anything is better than working at these dollar stores. The scheduling is inconsistent and the managers are mostly lazy. They run you like a dog and don't pay enough for what they are asking you to do. They rarely allow for more than 2 people per shift which is ridiculous.
bad,I would never work here agian u give them every thing and the dont appreciate you they treat you like slaves and they dont like to pay for your travel time when they make you go out off town to work
bad,They are horrible they are racist and rude and make life miserable I dont recommend working or shopping there they are so unstable and so uncleanness and just rotten
bad,Very unprofessional setting all around. they didnt even investigate a theft incodent....a woman stole a buggy ful of stuff on my shift...told me if i quit before investigation was I would be charged for the theft..no investigation was ever completed
bad,very  company to work for you do not get reimbursed for millage if they ask you to travel made me drive 3 hrs for a meeting that never happend and then hotel tells you you cant stay
bad,Micro managed in every aspect with unreasonable expectations.  Upper management has no real world experience.  No work life balance.  Inconsistent direction.
bad,Only worked there part time while looking for a full time job in my regular profession. I found something else and left after almost a year. Very hard work environment.
bad,"is doing the  add for the store and knowing the products  in the store "
bad,"the management is unprofessional, not understanding care broke down lost job fired via texted and now cant get unemployment, when to sign papers signed receipt not professional at all"
bad,Was robbed at gun point. Was insufficiently  trained on company procedures. Communication was next to nothing between employees with each doing their own thing.
bad,I believe had I had a decent key holder that I worked with it wouldn't have been so bad.  But when you tell them to call the police about someone have a knife waving it around and they won't there is a real problem of safety.  Our manager at the time was awesome always pleasant to work with and for. I would not suggest this for people wanting a second income.  Your availability is something that holds you back in a position there.  I wouldn't work there again seeing what the employees are treated like by upper management
bad,"The days at the dollar general change daily do to the the amount of customers who shop, however you are still required to finish the required tasks for that day. On truck day you are expected to to work rolltainers that are 6 feet tall and filled with inventory. They give you one hour to unload the rolltainers, open the boxes, lace it in the correct spot and breaking down the boxes. while you are working on the inventory you are still expected to help customers and perform all other tasks within the time you are scheduled to work. They do expect for you to clock out on time and for all items to be done regardless of how busy the store is on that day. There is also always two employees scheduled and they only give you both 15 minutes to perform closing procedures.  The key holder is denied lunch breaks due to if a customer has a return, or the cashier needs a void the key holder is expected to assist on their break.They also dont get reimbursed for gas used to take deposits to the bank or to get change. the key holders are also not able to leave the store grounds on their lunch breaks. The only enjoyable part about the job is the employees and the customers. the cashiers are being paid 8.50 per hour which is minimum wage and the key holders which are performing the same tasks as the assistant manager and store manager minus the ability to hire and fire employees are only making 8.75 which is a quarter more than cashiers for doing twice the workload."
bad,everything was wrong about it the management was not good both of them quit and walked out the store wasn't together there was a lot of stuff that wasn't put up.
bad,"no support poor management, did not receive support from Store management and district manager.  Still have received a phone call.   Very hostile environment."
bad,"The company doesn't care about it's employees, the customers, or the environment. I wouldn't recommend anyone work here let alone shop here. Don't even consider working here."
bad,Dollar General is so unorganized! Terrible Management! The store is ALWAYS a complete mess! Rude customers. They barely give you hours! its just a overall FAIL!
bad,"When your relief didn't show up for their shift, you had to stay on.  The manager would not come in or take responsibility to find a replacement.  You would work from 7 AM to 10:30 PM, a lot.  Also you would be the only employee in the store for more than 8 hours with no breaks."
bad,"It was a terrible experience. They left me alone on a register my first day. The store was ALWAYS a mess. I always had to wait for everyone to finish their breaks before I could go on mine, even if I clocked in 3 hours before the other person did. I will never step foot back into that place of business."
bad,"Was promised midshifts to work with my child's schedule but promise was broken in 3rd week, and hours were cut down to lowest, would never work for them again"
bad,Dollar general does not stick to there word I was told I was gonna be promoted to lead associate full time they back out of that. Then they moved managers around to different stores did not tell the employees anything I was told the change would more affect my hours and then I lost teen hours a week.
bad,"hours and too much personal drama, it is hard to get people to show and imposible to get rid of them . upper management has no interest in store operations its all handeled in house"
bad,"You will have no home life if you are store manager, they want you to do 10 different things while being in the store by yourself till 12 or longer in the day."
bad,"Dollar General's rule is Customer First: even before the employee's health, time, and life. They could be flexible with hours, only if the management says so, and if they don't change the schedule whenever they please. After working for 4 different stores in my state, I can tell you the management is garbage."
bad,I loved working with the customers at the store..  Most were very nice. Dollar General is not a efficient company.  They have no incentives for employees.  There is no company structure.  They never listen to problems within the store.  The store is nasty there is no cleaning procedures.  As a key holder you are expected to run a large store with only one person or by yourself. People steal all the time because they know there is little help and we cannot watch the whole store. We find empty packages. I have had to lock the store to go to the restroom.  The new manager only worked daytime- maybe one night a week if he had to.  He would leave early before his shift was over to pick up his kids and not return.  Even the assistant store manager left the company because of her back.  Some of the boxes are really heavy.  She had to have back surgery.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  Low pay and bad hours. No benefits without you pay for them.  Insurance is very high.
bad,I was placed in a store in a city where race played a part in your work environment. after my life was threaten the district manager old me there was nowhere for her to put me. than when I told her I wouldn't come back to that store she put me in as non rehireable.
bad,All about the rules but no one follows them.  And when you report things to HR it goes no where or they lie about it.  The company is all about the money.  They use you for all they can take then cut your hours for no reason.  Worst company ever.
bad,They get their work out of you then treat you like dirt. Complete waste of time and effort. Manager sits in office all day doesn't lift a finger to help. Barks orders at you in front of customers. If you're not a part of the click then you are treated poorly and expected to do all the work.
bad,They are unprofessional and steal from the company. They never do there jobs and leave blame the associates for everything. The managers are rude and have no respect for there workers
bad,This company is not fair at all. The employees steal and lie. No one is honest. The managers are crooks. I just would not recommend this place to work. The pay isn't worth it either.
bad,"would not work there again, falling waters wv, not a good company. not enough workers, not enough hours, management was okay, hardest part of the job was how they treated you"
bad,"The company doesn't care anything about the workers there, they put way to much on you and not enough help and then treat the workers bad because there is not enough staff there to get the work done. The manages treat you like they are so much better then you that you don't even feel like you should speak to them. Very horrible place to work and it starts from the top."
bad,"there are a lot of things that need to be worked on, for starters they need people that are willing to do their jobs and not call in or be no call no shows, and others that are lazy and don't want to do their jobs, and there is a lot of people that like to talk about others which is something that i am not a big fan of."
bad,You do not receive no hours unless you are a manager. You never get to work day shift unless you are and manager. You work mostly nights no days. Wasn't the best job but it was a job.
bad,"There were not many hours to go around to all the employees and when I did work I had to clean the dumpster area which was inhabited by the homeless, so it was very unsanitary."
bad,Working for the company  was very stressful for me. There was a major lack of communication with the managers and no teamwork was supported. Everyone seemed to work against each other.
bad,"Was so bad that they did not care for their employees, wouldnt give overtime to get the store in proper shape and would always complain cause we couldnt keep with the store while also juggling one of the busiest stores in the district."
bad,"Working in retail can be really trying. Working retail in ""the hood"", that is just a terrifying category on it's own. Working for this company was terrible, to say the least. The store I was at was consistently getting robbed. I would have to deal with sweaty boob and sock money when the temperature was hot. It was a lesson learned."
bad,I enjoyed work for the company as a whole.  just had issues with the management.  Worked anywhere from 35 to 40 hours a week.  I enjoyed working with the public and getting to know the ones that shopped there.
bad,"The Manager who's on duty most of the days of the week is an complete a hole. He is certainly unfit for the job and will be the worst you will encounter. All employees are wonderful people , the store could have potential but just need new manager.         "
bad,They expect you to be in two places at once. back doing stock where its hard to see register and running the register at the same time. You either look at register to much or stock to much wasnt ever good enough. assistant manager took naps in the bathroom and the manager constantly was on phone with boyfriend. I really dont recommend this to anyone. Maybe other locations are better.
bad,"It was just supposed to be temporary. I was just there to open and set up the store, they offered me a position and I wish I would have listened to my first mind and not taken that position. Management was horrible."
bad,Top Management was poor and the pay was terrible. If you asked for a raise it would always be turned down. Men on staff were also treated better than women.
bad,Manager was unethical . A very hostile work place.Manager gave all key holders her  alarm codes. No one had their own. Associates threatened violence.
bad,They don't care about you or your family if you are the store manager you have to do everything plus run the register. It's truly the worst company to work for in retail
bad,I was promoted quickly. That was the only good part of this job. The coworkers were terrible and lazy. Management was even worse. The store manager was habitually late.
bad,"managers don't know there jobs , lack of employee, district manager is ignorant and sucks . They depend on u too spend your life in the store . Pay sucks"
bad,"didn't care for all the hours requested to be a store manager. they have very high demands for there employees, and things change almost daily. and I feel instead of having a conference call every week to repeat the same things, that they should take it up with that store manager."
bad,"typical was 3-11i learned how run a register scoot magmet was bad "
bad,Not a good place to work the manager have attitude  problems.....they dnt kno how to talk to people. I feel like they need to inprove the general manager
bad,"The work was what one would expect, i.e. long hours and task filled days.  However, the field management is the main problem with the company.  During my tenure with DG I had over 5 district managers and three regional managers while remaining in the same store.  Each and every one of these managers had a different approach to management, as one expects, but they were wildly different from what policy dictates and also their predecessors directives.  It leads to a very poorly staffed district, the burden of which fell upon my shoulders and those of other tenured managers to fill positions, even if only in a temporary capacity, in order to keep stores open."
bad,"This company expects the world of you while only giving you a speck in it. The mangers were the worst, the key holders were ok most times. Many of my co-workers were parents and it seemed that they were the ones always being scheduled to close and open back to back nights. Not a great or even good place to work."
bad,"i have worked for 3 stores in the 3 different locations and all of the managers are very unprofessional. They set you up for failure even after letting them know you don't know how to do a certain task. Easy job, horrible managers."
bad,"Manager is more stressful then the workplace itself, at Agra Dollar General, that is. Typical night shift consists of completing the morning shifts duties and likewise for the other way around. Constantly getting called in on days off and when not scheduled. The only thing enjoyable about working at Agra Dollar General is being able to make friends and interact with customers."
bad,"I liked working at DG when I first started. I learned how to count tills and check in vendors, but no one really taught me things that I really needed to know. I guess it really depends on the store you work at."
bad,"Very disrespectful and unappreciative, Cashier experience was a plus. And made my Customer Service skills stronger. Typical day, I went in and counted my drawer and started my day, which consisted of checking people out and stocking shelves when there was no customers."
bad,"Dollar general was not the place for me, I barely got paid good even after becoming manager. The hardest was making sure everyone was doing their job correctly and if not having to fire them or sign them up"
bad,Dollar General is not a good place to work at due to the fact of the company ask for to much wiyh no hours and little pay. The company expects you to do doubleshift if somebody calls out.
bad,"If all you want is part-time hours for some spending money, it's fine. Store manager positions require 48 hours a week. They require you work 6 days a week. Don't choose Dollar General for a career."
bad,It was terrible. I did not get enough hours and I did not get paid enough for the work I was expected to do. And the manager picked favorites. I hated this job and will not recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I worked for them for 1 year and opened and closed the store in Tecumseh Oklahoma. I got hurt mopping the floor, the cameras seen it and I sewed them and won."
bad,I was a store manager and often worked 70-80 hours a week and never got paid for it. they say you shouldn't be working that many hours and if you are then something is wrong with your store. well whats wrong is they don't pay anyone enough for the work they are asking to be done and people don't show up especially if they have another job. then what happens is the store manager (me) is there by myself trying to complete the work
bad,Poor management here. Every store I've been to has been hectic. So I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. I would recommend it if they really needed a job.
bad,"not a good place to work employees are given to much work to complete in so little time. district managers are a joke don't even show up when needed. they think we all steal even if we are busting our butt for the company, no good benefits for part time and almost never want to give full time to avoid giving benefits hours are a joke as 5 hrs a week is nothing"
bad,"If you want to work 6 days minimum, have no life, constantly loose a staff due to paying them $7.25, tons of freight that doesn't fit weekly, no hours for employees, working by your self half the day, no lunches, getting robbed, displays everywhere you walk, poor leadership, and no room to advance even after proving yourself then this is the place for you!"
bad,"If you're looking for a basic job that you're not gonna stay at long this may be the company to apply with. they aren't all that understanding when it comes to family or a loved one who has passed. With so little of moral, it's hard to say happy during your shift. The customers are rude most of the time and you have to be ready for anything. I was shot at."
bad,Boss was inexperienced and didn't know how to run the schedule or the store. Showed favoritism to other employees. Employees wouldn't work with each other and would slack off
bad,"This was supposed to be a ""team"" effort kind of place. But it wasn't. On top of the Store managers never helped or wanted to help with anything including questions."
bad,"Honestly I hated working here. My boss was rude to myself and other employees "
bad,Run the register stock and help with the customers. Its point blank the suckiest place to work management was horrible. they don't give enough pay roll.
bad,This company does not care about their employees. They work them like dogs with promises of change and advancement and never follow through. The turnover rate is unbelievable.
bad,this store had to be one of the worst stores ive ever worked at. not only does the manger steal items from out of the store she also cusses at you infront of all of your customers and makes you feel very belittled even after you do favors for her.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about dollar general,they do not give pt asst enough hours . where i work the manager lest the asst manager,do what ever he wants"
bad,I wouldn't work there if my life depended on it ever again. They lie and cheat. If they had better management things might be better but when I was there it was awful.
bad,store manager was too young and unexperienced in management. Terrible floor plan and customers often complained of the trash throughout the store. booooo
bad,It's a poor job to have. You are low paid for hard laboring work especially if you are a key holder. This place also doesn't believe in promoting within the business is why I left.
bad,This company pay the minimum amount and expect a lot of work no advancement just a key holder on cashier pay. I got the experience I needed to advance
bad,"The stores have great opportunity, but the way the entire program is set up you will always get the same results.  Long lines and unsatisfied customers but they continue to come because there is one on every corner."
bad,The pay was bad and the store was a complete mess. Stock was very messy and it was very unorganized with that being said the management was constantly making mistakes but they cleaned up and now the store is in excellent condition. The normal workday was easy going however it did get get stressful from time to time.
bad,You have to work the register all day with no help. You have to work the evening shift 3-11 while other employees  do not. There is no safety in the store to many robberies.
bad,"Poor management, failed safety regulations, underpaid employees, poor customer service, understaffed, rude managers, no benefits, no incentives, no opportunities."
bad,it started out good but near the end it was like high school.no one got along and management didn't do much for it.everyone talked about each other.i was happy to quit.
bad,This company is the worst to work for. It does not care about its employees. Is known to dismiss the good employees that are there to actually work. They tend to keep those employees that are only there to get free money
bad,Nice company to work for but my manager was always rude and always late. She was never on time and I was always on time. Always made up excuses and seemed mad all the time and seemed like she hated me from day one.
bad,I would not recommend this company to nobody the don't give you any hours they treat there employees like your nothing they don't pay u correct Money for the hours you worked my checks were short a few times and they try to make u feel like I don't no what your talking about  worst company ever its got poor management to.
bad,I was sent all over place played store manager but didn't receive pay I was pregnant with twins made to work lots of hours then when I took FMLA cause my dad was dying from cancer didn't have long to live while he died I was terminated and put on as non rehire list and then district left went to work for another company!!!
bad,"typical day at work: late employees, rude employees, going home sweety due to the unfair work load placed on only the male employees. what i leaned: that kissing butt and being bad at your job gets you promoted. management: is what im best at. workplace culture: dealing with a bunch of scared men and women worried bout getting fired for doing their jobs. the hardest part of my job: working for a company that does not value their employees. the most enjoyable part of the job: training I love training employees being in the position to teach someone better then i was shown is very fun thing."
bad,"dollar general was by the far the very worst company ive ever worked for. theft, both internal and external is rampant. Company policies and standards are not followed. Managers were very verbally and emotionally abusive. Supervisors and managers are expect to work multiple shifts and are often left in the stores alone for hours on end. I've worked MANY days from 5am to 2pm in one location, then 3pm to close at a different location, being told it was not an option to no and i would be terminated if I did not do so. I honestly do not know how their business practices are legal."
bad,"This is by far the most worst place i have ever worked. the store was dirty snd cluttered, the management was poor, i barely seen any of my managers, people kept stealing and alot of the equipment is old or doesnt worked"
bad,over worked and under paid. They always expect for to stay well over your time. They go in and manually take out your lunch and breaks even if you have not taking one. They expect you to come on your day off. they are really understaffed and dont care if you have kids to come home too
bad,you didn't get paid much for what you did. they wanted a cashier to do a managers job. if you wanted a week off for vacation you didn't get paid for it.
bad,"Dollar General is an aweful place to work for. They promise you 30 or more hours and they may give you 9. I was hired in as a Full-time keyholder. They refuse to train you correctly so you have to figure it out yourself. "
bad,Dollar general is a company that you can grow in and they have a great management system and they are a company that has grow rapidly though the 3year that I have been in the company.Its just that I Vera would like to learn different thing in life
bad,"They cut my hours to the point I was not working for a month. I decided to quit due to this. the manager was okay, however, it took her a dozen complaints in one day to fire a worker whom was rude and inappropriate to work there."
bad,Extremely poor management when I worked there. Poor management skills in regard to who is supposed to be doing what during closing which resulted in things being left unfinished.
bad,"I would have to open the store by myself 6 or sometimes 7 times a week and would be stuck alone there for 2 hours after opening by myself and be expected to get a lot done when there was no help. the next person would come in for a 4 hour shift and I was expected to do the work of 6 or 7 hours in 4 and had to take an hour break in that 4 hours and help the other person with their work. I would then be left by myself for the last hour or 2 of my shift. I put 110% into my job and still was threatened my job if stuff didnt get done in a certain period of time where it wasnt possible with what I was given and I still tried my best to push myself to do even better. I wasnt allowed my vacation after working there for almost a year and working 6 or 7 days every week and all I wanted was a weekend off to see my family. I wasnt offered any benefits throughout my time there and the manager at the time was lazy and didnt do anything in that store and would blame his crew, including me to be the fault of it, when he wasnt lifting a finger to do anything except paperwork."
bad,This company offers nothing worthwhile to any of its associates. Part time workers are not given access to any healthcare benifits or any other benifit of any kind. The corporate decides to stock stores with only part time associates and never has enough people hired to one store. This creates much more work for the associates who are in the store especially with long lines of customers when they are understaffed.
bad,My experience was terrible. I did not enjoy myself at all. management was horrible. Store schedule was all over the place. Never knew what I had to work til the day of.
bad,I would not able to work there no more cause the manger lied on me and aid that I did a no show no call when she fired me for no reason at all. I was one of the best worker that they can have.
bad,"Do not work here unless you want to be a slave. terrible supervisors"
bad,Dollar General will make a good job if the right management in place. I've been a manager over 2 years and I appreciate the learning experience there.
bad,"ive worked for assistant manager at family dollar also.  These places are TERRIBLE  to work for. first they don't pay enough but theyre a million(or billion) dollar company, they have no store security(which is why they always get robbed) the management is so bad I cant even put it all in word but I will tell you if youre thinking about working for dollar general do not do it. you also get no life because they want you to work an abundance of hours with being worth it pay wise its ridiculous. the only good experience ive had working here was the vendors (like pepsi and coke) who come to the store and the representatives that put in the order."
bad,"This is a company that doesn't care about their employees in any way. The pay isn't worth the hassle of what they want. If the company would pay their people better the turnover rate wouldn't be as bad.  And corporate controls the temperature of eat store and because corporate isn't aware of each are for every store they cannot effectively control the temperature inside ever store. Therefore, in the summer it is very hot (standing still and you are still sweating)  and in the winter it is extremely cold. (Some days you can see your breath)"
bad,"This job is okay for someone who is only looking for a little extra money. I never felt like this job would help me advance any further, management was great."
bad,Don't want to share the money. Faulty registers and computers. Pay for employees is bottom line. No-one wants to work the hrs needed and have no home life without being compensated.
bad,"I was warned and didn't listen.  Every review saying that you will have no work /life balance is an under statement. There is such a lack of training,  communication, and respect in this organization that words can not begin to paint the picture. The profanity,  intimidation, and threats leads to levels of stress that are beyond normal for work. You only have one day a week off and then you are demanded to come in on that day and if you don't then you are viewed as a person who doesn't care about their store, instead of the person who just worked 10 or 14 days straight. It literally is modern day slavery. They go home to their families every evening but I was literally told after a few weeks at DG ""oh yeah tell your husband and kids you'll see'em in a couple of months "" At the time I thought it was a joke, until I found out it wasn't. And if you actually take your salary and divide it by the actual hours that you are there each week then you will fully understand how some weeks you may even not hit minimum wage. They do not allow a reasonable amount of staff to complete tasks and stop theft in the store."
bad,It was a pretty decent place to work but the manager didn't know what she was doing. There weren't many hours available so i barely worked 30 hours a week.
bad,"By far the worse place I have ever worked at. The store manager was sleeping with two employees in the store and was terminated for this. The area manager showed favoritism towards certain managers. Assistant managers worked in the store alone for an entire shift due to improper scheduling. Some people came to work late and drunk, they were managers."
bad,The management was careless and unprofessional. The employees were unprofessional and did not care about the quality of the store. The store was always a mess and customers often complained about the store being messy and items being in the wrong place.
bad,I didnt like it all at dollar general. The managers was very rude and wasn't helpful at all. They do not give many hours or work around school schedules
bad,It was terrible they would never give us enough hours and at both jobs the managers were very unprofessional telling me I had no need to work there due to the car I was driving around. also they had most of their families working there and a lot of favoritism towards them going on.
bad,"The manager was not running the store right at all. It was a complete mess and she rejected anyone that wanted to clean it up. She was to concerned with saving her own tail. Everything that happened she blamed on other employees. It was all reported and shes still there. Employees are scared of losing their job like i did so they wont say anything... This is terrible. I was there 3days and was put by myself as supervisor on that 3rd day and it was awful then i got in trouble for not doing my job ""right"" when she hadnt trained me yet. Id barely finished my modules!!! The computers were freezing alot and a week later i was put on schedule for 6am to work with the manager and she didnt even show up the whole day! Instead of calling me, she called the cashier whom shes bff with, and told her to tell me she wouldnt be there... My 1st morning coming in at 6am not knowing why or what to do.........  I believe the dm over this store needs to control this sm.... Im sure DG is a great place to work but not this one. Ive never seen a store in such awful condition and remaining that way instead of something being done.."
bad,This type of job isn't for everyone. It requires patience.Also requires a lot of time away from family. Payroll is very limited therefore management has to work extra to maintain more coverage at the store.
bad,The management is a joke. i was the assistant manager and was written up for doing my job. this place is sketchy at best. better to avoid the hassle and not even apply.
bad,I perform my job duties to the absolute best of my abilities. I enjoy helping my customers very much. I try to thrive for better every day. I enjoy my job.
bad,did not like anything about it it sucked manager stole my identity and tried to ruin my credit store was dirty and they did not pay nearly enough just a bad experience
bad,"The job is very very stressful and you are basically on your own. open/close the store, check in vendors, training, scheduling, hiring/firing, marketing, putting up plan-o-grams, cleaning, stocking, customer service, 16 hour shifts, closing store alone, opening store alone, banking, loss prevention, monitoring cameras that are on the staff, weekly ordering. The employees are mostly great but they don't stay long. Customers can be very rude when you don't have a sale item or a section in the store that they think you should have. You deal with customers threatening you and throwing things and stealing. 99% of the customers are wonderful but the1% can add to the stress level."
bad,Over all the place need work and a better manager because she don't care about the job it self she jus care about the money and the position! So with that being said she needs to be replace
bad,A typical day at work with dollar general you done everything from stocking and being a cashier to cleaning the whole store. You had to do everything within only 5 hours of a shift. If it was done within a 5 hour shift you got written uo. Not enough hours to do all that had to be done
bad,"They pay the managers salary for 40 hrs and then restrict the hours allowed for hourly employees. This results in the manager having to do the remaining hours to run the store. Then the manager has to work double and triple the 40 hours to meet the goals which they need to get done for their position. The district and regional managers yell, bully, intimidate and threaten the store managers on a regular basis. These experiences were not just mine, they are the normal experiences for the managers of Dollar General.  I loved dealing with the customers and took pride in improving my store."
bad,stressful  not stocked underpaid  overworked lack of communication store was not clean at all . I think that  needed more staff  working there   the store was never stocked
bad,This is a good first job for a younger person or someone who doesn't need high income. Hours are very low unless you are manager or assistant manager. Key holders aren't even full time. Left this job due to lack of pay.
bad,no overtime and no raises and they work you to death and have to do more that one job too many hours for the less pay not enough money don't like working looking for another and better job
bad,Old management sucked.  They would hire people who didn't know what they were doing and never wanted to show and when they did they didn't do their job and you had to pick up their slack.
bad,"Poor hours, poor pay, poor management and poor treatment of employees. The work it self was alright, though rusted equipment caused potential danger to employees and customers alike, not to mention the trip hazards through out the store. The bathrooms were cleaned on a ""if you can't see it, it's clean"" basis."
bad,I wouldn't recommend my dog to work at this horrible place. They overwork the management to keep hours low and underpay them as well. You get little to no help from your district manager. Their rules are broken to their benefit I.e. There is to be two people to close the store at night. I closed the store many nights alone even contacted the DM and was told I had to close store alone.
bad,Worked on average 60-70 hours a week with little to no help. There were several times where I was the only key holder on the payroll and I was just expected to work all day and all night and when I asked for help they acted like I was asking for the world.
bad,"They ask you to do wayyyy too much for what you are paid. They want you to stock an over designated amount in so little time, when they themselves can't even do it. Meanwhile you have to check out the customers and provide customer services, while sweating and trying to rush back to your stock so you don't get written up. They will give you good hours one week and the next you're screwed on eating or paying bills."
bad,The job itself is not hard if you actually want to work. Management and the corporation is what makes it a terrible place to work. You are not paid adequately for the amount of work that is expected of you. They pay the bare minimum and expect the impossible. Morale is nonexistent. I have witnessed discrimination and wrongful terminations that went without repercussion to the manager in question. You will not be valued as a human being if you work for this company. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
bad,Work yourself to death for a low wage and no appreciation you will work yourself to insanity and beyond I left on my own accord an would never go back
bad,"Experience at Dollar General is just like every other major retail chain: terrible, unappreciative, hard work, all with a minimum wage pay that does not justify the work that is expected out of a single employee."
bad,They are horrible to work for and they do not pay you. I had to call the labor board just to get past paychecks. They do not respect your disabilities and have no patience for anything or anyone.
bad,pay is terrible management is terrible work is way too much for pay one of the worst experiences I have ever had in all my years working would not recommend
bad,I don't care for this job when you have a rude disrespectful boss that doesn't make coming to work fun and only nice to a few of her employee nobody d
bad,"get yelled at by customers"
bad,At the dollar general I work at they promote people who end up getting fired but don't promote those who know how to do the job. The manager is lacking in organizational skills and rarely gets a schedule out on time. Overall the environment is lacking what I am looking for in a job and I am unimpressed with the supervisors in their ways of handling things.
bad,A typical day at  Dollar General Begins with chaos and ends with chaos. The manager simply does not know how to adequately run a successful store and takes too much time worrying about what the employees aren't doing to see what they are doing and how hard they are working.
bad,"Hard work for little pay, ungrateful customers, and constantly unhappy employees. Lots of clutter and always messy. Would not recommend to work there for anyone."
bad,They don't care about their employees just their customers. They let the customers come in an treat employees how ever. They wonder why they have a high turn over rate. Taking care of your employees is what keep your stores running.
bad,"Is an ok company to work for ,But when you are a good worker they treat you like dirt they use you and then don't take care of there people, the turn over is very high for this reason and then the company cant figure out why they cant keep help."
bad,Manager expected employees to drop anything/everything to come into work on off days. Treated us like we were morons. No training whatsoever. Rude coworkers. Expected to do the job of 10 people by myself in one night.
bad,"Not a fun place to work "
bad,Very bad management and not a lot of opportunity to grow. Even for a entree level job would not recommend for someone trying to build customer service skills.
bad,Some workers put in all of the work while others rapidly get promoted the managers are no help to a sales associate and they dont stand by their policies
bad,"DANGEROUS. do not work here. They expected us, as managers to be loss prevention and actually frisk people. We were constantly put down by our bosses and even our customers! Robbed once a week."
bad,"A typical day there was having other management come in and talk behind their employees backs, expected you to do your job then others as well. I loved it there until they brought new management in and took over, just to find out they got discharged. I was there the longest along with my Assistant Manager, we didn't get advanced once our hiring manager passed away. We just pretty much got tossed to the side."
bad,I opened and close the store only at 18 year old and they only paid me 8.15hr the system was out dated and the benefits varied day by day. Some nights I had no one to close with me.
bad,"Work style there was very messy and drama full. Manger would talk bad about many people, even customers, and would not work with their workers. Would not recommend to people."
bad,"They're not understanding. When something is wrong and when it's a manager supposed to take hands on they don't, they make you do it or you will just never know what you wanted to know, it's sad. I wouldn't recommending anyone working there, it's trash. Literally!"
bad,"Its not the customers that make a company such as this bad, its the management and polices that does not benefit the employees. Employees work hard to get nothing once they get sick on the job."
bad,They do not train you for management. You are thrown to the wolves and higher management puts more pressure on you to know what you are doing. The employees will do anything to get you fired.
bad,Job sucks. There really isnt much room for advancement. Company doesnt value or care about its employees. It is a selfless company. Worked there for a year
bad,"it's a good place to work if you're a female,  if you're a male though, they tend to make the guys do all the heavy lifting and promoted the women faster then the guys"
bad,Get some training and move on to a better and bigger paying job. A high risk job and very stressful and a very high turn around. Poor leadership and poor pay.
bad,The work place was very unacceptable the store manager is very rude to staff and customers.... She expected too much it was a very unsafe and unpleasant working environment...
bad,they are not a safe place to work they have been robbed 4 times that i know of and they don't clean their store right and ill never refer some one to work here at all
bad,"Nepotistic, cannibalizing of good people, and hostile to progress, Dollar General's atmosphere was that of a gulag with the audacity to believe it paid you a fair wage."
bad,They don't care about their employee safety you are left in the store alone. Hard to request any time off they give you a hard time. Not a family-friendly company
bad,Con artist who don't care about there employees they steal from you and you have no life no family when u work for them they will work you to death not train you and hold you accountable for there error and mistakes in a tornado they make u stay in to make sure there for is ok they don't donate the products they no longer sell but are brand new they don't have grafted benefits of salaries for the lead they expect you to keep up with they bully you into thinking that they can control you an any way threaten you
bad,"This is a retail environment.  You must be on your toes, most of the stores are in high crime neighborhoods.  Please be careful.  This is the most I learned."
bad,"Usually I clean up the front of the store, ring a few people up, mop and then go home. The work is very slow and very boring. Good for someone who is lazy."
bad,"Dollar General told me when they hired me that I would full time, make more money and have a higher position. However I didn't get any of the promised things. The job atmosphere was horrible and the manager and assistant managers, etc were not professional and came to work smelling like alcohol"
bad,Not a good environment to work in. Not much help from corporate to get all the tasks done in a timely manner.  llllllllllllll            lllllllllll lllllllllll
bad,very low wages. very little room for advancement and management usually isn't friendly. I will never go back to the company and I don't recommend anyone else too either.
bad,there is too much being asked of the employees for minimum wage. I've never understood how the new employees would always get to work before the managers. Hardest part of the job was stocking and deal with some of the customers
bad,the management staff was extremely rude and disrespectful to customers and staff.A work schedule was never posted until the day before it started. I did many jobs that were supposed to be completed by management.
bad,they did not care about there employees they think you are thieves when you come into the doors and they do not send help when the store is in need they will come in and fire the entire staff if they think there is a thief in the staff but they will not find just the one person.
bad,This is one of the worst places I have ever worked. The company its self has no trust in their employees and management staff they have put into place themselves. The district managers are always wavering on the job titles and duties of the employee and on policies. If you are not willing to bend to their rules and will you will not make it here. Do not voice ethical issues or morals with higher staff as having these or a voice will get you fired. The pay is far below what you are made to do and you will do things not in your job description. The life of a Dollar General employee is less than a year.
bad,DG is a highly demanding job especially if you become Manager. Whether it is my district or all of them putting in 60 to 70 hours a week doesn't seem to matter to them. Your family doesn't matter it's all about the store. No matter what you accomplish it will never be enough for DG.
bad,All around bad.....!!! Very rude people to work with. Management sucks. Hours are poor. Nasty store. I would never recommend this job to anyone. Hope this helps.
bad,"Doesn't have very good customer service, coworkers can be very lazy, store is always messy , I advised not to go to the Dollar General on Pippin Road in Colerain"
bad,This was a horrible place to work at. The managers talked about me and made coming to work hard to do. They played favorites and would usually pile more work on me than the other employees.
bad,"I hate working here i'm so glad I done with this place. I can say I probable only like working at two DG's. I wouldn't send anyone to this job. If you can deal with drama, and hate from different childish store managers then this is the job for you. Good luck your going to need it."
bad,"Not very helpful with life situations, there's not a support system there, everybody tells everybody your personal business. Everybody acts as if they're there for you, but they're really not... The only plus side about them is, that if you need a ride.. a manager will come and get you. Another good thing is that there is always more than one person in the store at all times."
bad,dolor general is a great place to shop. the prices are competitive and he sales are awesome. unfortunately the training is severly lacking in almost every store ive been to or worked in. they teach you the basics but if your promoted its hands on and you don't know whats happening when.
bad,"Dedicated 7 years of my life to this place... No appreciation. Employees don't even get a discount. Managers are expected to be super humans and get everything done, all while being on the register in the store by themselves because the company that makes millions limits payroll to almost nothing. Sure, it would be good money if you only had to work the required hours or if you got paid for working extra... But neither of those things happen in dg. Horrible upper management and stingy, money hungry company. That is exactly why most dg's look terrible on a regular basis. I ran, hands down, the best store in my district and it still wasn't good enough."
bad,Horrible place to work ! I just have nothing good to say about dollar general it's hard work very hot the supervisors want to firer you ! Your tinder at the company means nothing ! The insurance is outrageous and pays very little of your visit
bad,No help from district manager on up. No team work. No ethics. No morals. Little pay for big expectations. Low employee moral. No benefits. No holidays off.
bad,Dollar General is a stressful job and they do not care if you are injured or not. They also work you like a dog with no recognition. To much going on.
bad,The store manager was horrible and mean to everyone that came through the door and she was also mean to the employees and used worked and held the new employees to over achieved goal
bad,"Constant threat of job loss,  poor management,  understaffed,  overworked, bad schedule,  no benefits,constantly on camera, no trust, no privacy, horrible pay,  unrealistic dress codes, almost never get breaks when you're supposed to.  My whole experience working there ducked. As a key holder I did everything manager is supposed to do but without the salary. Was constantly left to run the store completely alone which is almost impossible with a constant stream of customers,  stocking,  truck drivers and vendors that need checked in,  reports to run..."
bad,"It was a decent place to work though."
bad,Long hours and upper management have their favorite stores and teams. Stores don't work together with coverage. Stressful work conditions and high turnover.
bad,I learned a lot about working in the retail field at Dollar General. I enjoy working with customers and doing everything that I can  do to make them happy. Overall I think Dollar General is a overrated. They expect you to do to much with little pay.
bad,"They will screw you at every chance they get. Be prepared for no time off, no holidays off, and zero care for the individual employer.  Turnover is extremely high and managers can't seem to last over 6 months before they realize they're simply a utility."
bad,"My manger is the most rudest,unorganized,hatefull manager I have ever had. I do not mind long hour's or working but it is kinda hard to work in a stress full environment."
bad,"I am a store manager and this is the worst company I have ever worked for, I work  68-75 hours a week ( a lot of shifts by myself) and I received an email from my dm that I'm not working enough!"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone apply at that store. The only decent manager quit due to the stress caused by the store manager and district manager. unreasonable expectations are placed on the employees, and the stress is not worth the minimum wage job."
bad,You don't want to work here. The managers are poor and you are on your own to solve problems in which you are unqualified because they do not trust cashiers to void or price override their own transactions.
bad,"you barely get any hours, management shows a lot of favoritism, they screwed up my pay check 4 times before I finally quit because I wasn't getting paid correctly, they'll have you being the only cashier when there is 5 of them there and a line of 20 or more people."
bad,A typical day of work here was me running circles trying to do everything. I had to stock and run the register. The management was very horrible and the pay isn't great. The stores are always dirty and you don't have a crew to help you.
bad,DM says 1 thing but then doesnt something different. Rules are allowed to be broken if it make the customers happy. Customer say and do as they please then employees have to apologize just to keep the customer coming back
bad,manager never did work. and district manager didnt care. a typical day would start at 745 sometimes asked to work till 1030 at night. the manager would show up for her shifts.
bad,They do not give the stores sufficient hours to keep up with the demands.  The stores are porely stocked and dirty.  They overwork their managers because they are on salary.
bad,they work you in the dirt the hours and ridiculous and they have no problem wanting you to work 34 hours in two days time i would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Unfortunately, I have not had a very good experience with this company. They tell you they want to move you up a level and take it away. Then they revisit the idea again and take it away. Then they offer you  a higher position again. This time having you retake the drug test and train for the position and yet again take it away. They only give part time employees 15 hours a week. They also expect you to not have another job and open availability while giving you only 15 hours a week. The only thing I have to say that I enjoy about this job are my coworkers and the customers."
bad,i enjoyed working at dollar general an had awesome coworkers just had to quit because they got a new store manager that was giveing the new people with less experince more hours an knew i always did what i had to to go home so we had a falling out an i got to where i couldnt take it anymore
bad,"Was basically on-call, some weeks worked 60 hours, other weeks got my hours cut to 2, constantly under pressure, no employees, store manager looked stressed enough to have a heart attack."
bad,"when I first started here everyone was was so nice, but when I meet the corporate lady she was so unprofessional, she talked about what the employees drove and what they wore even if she had on a shirt that was too small the buttons looked like it was about to pop off and not to metion her body odor."
bad,I was treated totally unfair my store manager brought her keys to my home while i was on sick leave leaving only a cashier in the store that was unaware that the manager was gone and myself being the only other key holder was thrown into a position i was not comfortable doing let alone having the right knowlage to do!!!
bad,I would usually come in and count all registers and make sure deposit was set for next day.  I would clean the store and then ring the customers one by one. I learned not everyone can work in retail and not all managers have your best interest.  Hardest part of my job was to continuing to smile while customers were rude. I really enjoyed meeting new people and knowing i made their experience pleasant!
bad,Was there a week. I gad to mandatory clock out at 1020 but not lwave the store till 11pm and worked the whole time. Get home after 11pm and have to be back at 530 am the next morning.  Got hired on at 10.50 a hr came to pay day check said 9.00hr.  Broke federal laws and lied about the wage.
bad,They give me maybe 11 hours a week. The store was (and still is to this day) trashed. The lines were always long with the supposed help hiding in thw office most of the time.
bad,"Not the best place to work, the company will give you random hours and sometimes you get 4 sometimes you get 30 not consistent at all  and not staffed well, it was scary coming in at 7 by yourself with no lights in the parking lot and not worth the pay even in manager positions scary and unpleasant  place to work not enough cashiers and angry customers!!!!"
bad,........job wasn't that good wouldn't say if I would go back there on not the people were okay to work with but I was very comfortable working there..
bad,This company does not pay their employees or management well at all. They expect too much work for what they pay and if you are not in management you are not offered benefits.
bad,"The company speaks about a culture of ""Serving Others"" but the Regional & Executive leadership team is out of touch with store employees. Very aggressive & demanding management style. No care for the employees just a quick turn & burn intentional mentality."
bad,"This company is horrible to work for. It does not care about it's employees. They want to write you up for every little thing, they expect you to go out of your way for them but when your life is endangered by crazy customers they could care less."
bad,I wanted to work more hours because I had a family to feed and take care of. They were only allowing me to work less than 2 days a week. There was no way we were able to work with others at the registers. Only one employee at the register and if they needed another employee it would be with the manager.
bad,"If you work at Dollar General, expect to be on-call every day of every week. They will threaten your job if you do not respond or if you try to call out, they will treat you like a doormat, they will pay you the absolute minimum that they can. The reason they can keep their prices so low is because they treat their employees so poorly and pay as little as they can get away with."
bad,This job is OK if your not looking for a lot of money but its very slow and long but the customers are very nice keep a positive attitude which makes its ok
bad,"Worst company to work for. DM and managers treat employees like a dog. I got injured at work doctor put me on 6 week medical leave submitted request to proper chain of command, was approved and then I was terminated after 6 days."
bad,"• Assist customers with buying decisions"
bad,"Horrible hours, rude manager, constant change of schedule with no notice."
bad,This again is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Again overworked and under paid and under appreciated. The harder I worked the worse I was treated.
bad,I hated working here. the manager wasn't professional at all. I wouldn't recommend no one working here. The service was very awful. it was an easy job it was just the management wasn't up to standard
bad,"I have been working here for nearly three months and have had two managers because dollar general simply can't keep one. The entire corporation as a whole does not treat their employees well what so ever, which is what drove our previous manager to quit."
bad,I would not recommend dollar general to anyone for a place to work. I have a child who takes sezuires and they would not let me go when she was in the hospital
bad,Not a good place to work they don't care about their employees the managers​ are horrible the stores are horrible and not clean I really hated working there
bad,"sucked. sucked. sucked. sucked. worst job ever, worst management ever, worst store ever, worst time ever, hot, humid, long hours, hardly days off, mangers stealing, non-compliance with college.hate it hate it hate it hate it."
bad,"I was a Key-holder for Dollar General. First off the pay is horrible. You aren't allowed to take breaks. You clock out for breaks but don't actually get to take them. Management would change your schedule and not tell you, They would also change your schedule hours before you're scheduled to be there. The customers were awful and extremely rude."
bad,Too many hours and too much work unrealistic goals salary is a joke if you don't have a good staff yet they don't give you the hours to schedule help !!
bad,They expect too much work for very little pay and you only receive benefits if full time. The manager that I worked with was rude and was not a very good people person. He was a difficult person to work with/for.
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers but scheduling was awful as was pay. I had to call in to the store to find out if I worked the next day, and I had to do this every day."
bad,Pretty bad company to work for honestly. Unless you want to get stuck as a cashier eventhough you are techinally a shift manager while others who have not been there as long as you get to be on the floor than by all means work for that company. Always got stuck working the night shift so that others didnt have to and boys got favored over the boys. Bad Company!!!!!!!
bad,It is a horrible company to work for. I would not recommend it to any one. The manager i had was lazy and disrespectful. They are very slow and can't keep help.
bad,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. Never could get good employees and ones that would like to work and help out. No one wanted to do what they needed to, management was all about there selves and no one else."
bad,"Not A Place Where Career Advancements Are Welcome, Too Many Training Opportunities, Negligent Upper Management, Not A Place Where You Can Grow Knowledge Or Skills, Company is Based On Family Values, And Valuing Employees To Help Them Achieve Higher Positions With Company, Training Period Is About 1 Week for An Out Of Company Store Management Hire, Not Enough On Hands To Learn The Basics. I Had Store Managers From Different Locations Gossiping About Employees, Employees Gossiping About Management, It was High School All Over Again, Policies Being Broken Day In And Day Out, and When The concerns were Directed To my Area Manager They Were Pushed Aside As Not Relevant, So As For Company Growth, NOT With Your District Managers! I Would Recommend Hiring More Adequate And Professionally Capable Individuals"
bad,"Started me off part-time, had me doing multiple jobs at once, lack of management. Poorly trained supervisors. a couple weeks before I would be eligible for benefits they cut my hours to 10 a week."
bad,Needed full time work to support my child that I was pregnant with at the time of employment with Dollar General. Horrible management and hours with little pay
bad,Awful. They treat their employees badly. They work them to death with little pay. Not fair scheduling. Impossible to even request a day off. Even though it is the only company ive worked for it is very awful.
bad,"That place sucks, like really, really, really, really bad. The management is terrible, I did not learn anything. I would never recommend anyone work there."
bad,They work you like a dog and don't pay enough but have pretty good management and good prices and are a good company if they paid you more money and gave discounts
bad,Management blames you for their mistakes. you get fired over the smallest over/shorts on the register which isn't even your fault either. The register would constantly cause problems.
bad,This company was terrible to work for. I'm currently in the prossecess of a lawsuit with this company for forcing me to work off the clock on my lunch brake.
bad,"The manager is hard to get along with, she will change your schedule without letting you know and then be upset when your not there. The store is always a huge mess and you can't find anything."
bad,This job is very unprofessionally and robbers come in and out almost every other day it was not a good experience or environment to be in. The coworkers were very rude.
bad,Mostly cashier and stocking work.  I learned to work with adults and other people around my age.  Management was a mess.  This was NOT a fun workplace.  The hardest part of my job was unnecessary drama.  Most enjoyable:  pleasant customers.
bad,The company cares more about their shareholders than its employees. Managers are left with very little hours to properly staff the store which then turns on the manager which is salaried to work 60hr work weeks to finish projects by deadline. Also the store manager is responsible for off loading own shipment truck that can contain over 400 pieces at times.
bad,hard work then work the managers like slaves. they don't give enough hours how can you run a store with one manager and one cashier. this is not logical and they don't care.
bad,"This store was once a good place to be, however the management now is awful! The store is always trashy looking. None of the employees are very nice or helpful. It's one of the worst stores I have ever had experience shopping at!"
bad,"They treat even the managers like they are stealing, They are beyond strict and not very helpful in the slightest bit. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"I loved the job always kept me busy until the new manager came ....she was the district manager best friend."
bad,"I have worked for this company as a mangager and I can say they dont care about their employees only about themselves and how to make that extra buck for less. This company back stabs their employees in the back and the employees will set you up to fail and get fire I have seen this first hand and had it dont to family. I dont reconmend this company to no one. Plus there is no organation to this company they dont know how to train there employees and manage how to maintain the lines and help each other, there is no team work at all."
bad,they take advantage of employees. they do not care about you our your kids doctors appointments. lack of professionalism with higher managment. bad place to work.
bad,low moral low pay many hours and most store conditions are very bad many of these discount chains are all the same want double the work for low pay and very little staff and payroll
bad,this company expected you to have no life and to work all the time. they didnt care how you felt and they didnt care if that was the only job that you had
bad,"Hated it . management was the reason for this review. I feel if you hire someone to do a job you should not micro-manage that employee. This can have a negative impact  on a lot of companies with unqualified employees. manager wasn't willing to teach or train, scared to have someone take their position."
bad,The managment was horrible. Hours constantly changing. The store was a mess with stock. Managers were not flexible with any requests. Overall i hated that job
bad,"I was used to do truck and hard work "
bad,"If I wasn't putting 75 hours of work in, I was getting severely underpaid, and severely over used… I had to quit because I had to put my college first. Always severely understaffed at whatever location I was put at. Was put at multiple locations during the week as well."
bad,"Management is horrible, lazy, & just don't care. All u have to do is show up. The rest they could care less! No type of training provided. Would recommend anyone waste their time !"
bad,"Dollar General # 6835 has some real issues. I have worked in many areas of the workplace and this store itself has some serious issues. I would not recommend anyone working for this store in New Braunfels. Poor management skills carry long-lasting effects and may infect an entire organization. Dollar General should recognize favoritism in the workplace and this store has carried it way  to far. This store has such a toxic environment. it is know wonder their employee turnover is terrible. When I finally reached the point that I could pick out more and more red flags, I knew that it was time too leave. I am only speaking about store #6835 of Dollar General."
bad,"Okay, place to work. Not alot of benefits or hours.   Hostile coworkers made shifts difficult..... I wouldn't recommend this job to a friend or family members."
bad,They want you to do it all. The polices are horrible and they only care about themselves. Some store managers think they are entitled. Honestly they need to get their stuff straight and be as harsh on the store managers as they are on the other employees.
bad,I worked here a couple of months and when my child was born I was almost not allowed to not come in to see her being born because of the manager so I quit
bad,"Pay is low, they expect two people to run the store at all times.  Stocking the shelves and running cash register at the same time.  Money goes missing nothing is done.  Employees get caught stealing, nothing is done because that person knew the GM was sleeping with the District Manager.  Will Call you in on your day off constantly.  One manager brought a gun to work everyday and would bully and harass everyone not just the women."
bad,There is absolutely no way to advance in this company unless you are friends with management. The district manager is a racist. Very few hours given and pay rate is terrible
bad,"This store was a mess, nothing was stocked correctly or in the right place, a complete truck in the back room with one on the way, there were 18 planograms that hadn't been done so merchandise could not go out, I was down 4 employees so I only had 4 to work with, no help from upper management."
bad,"Manager pushed me out of Clifton AZ by starting arguments between me and my family. She was mean, and didn't want me working for her. She ruined my life."
bad,my store didnt train me so i had no clue what i was doing. i got thrown onto a register and had a line of customers during christmas and couldnt figure out the register. even got left alone most of the time. so dont work here unless you demand training
bad,"Said I wanted to work a few hours a week part time, no more than 3 days a week. I told the GM this on my phone interview she gave me. Granted I worked for 5 months to get this part time job. So the first week I work 6 days in a row 6-8 hr shifts. Needless to say I didn't stay long. And it really upset me since I was so obviously clear on how much and when I wanted to work. Was also told I'd get to stock and do merchandising but she put me on register all day everyday."
bad,I worked at Dollar General for  almost 2 years and hated it. My issue was managment. My assistant manager was and still is the most miserable person I've ever met. She hated everyone and loved making me feel like a low life everyday. Nothing I did was good enough. The best part was getting 35 hours a week and customers.
bad,"I feel the company does not take what is necessary  for safety. not enough pay for to be stress over theft in the store, Dollar stores were always a target, just did not feel safe"
bad,The Management was not qualified. The communication will inadequate. The whole structure of this store was a mess. They were not willing to take suggestions from anyone. They already had their own click in place. I heard more about the drama in their personal lives than I did about store procedures. I am used to a more structured and safe professional environment. I understand why there is a big turn around with this company. It is very sad.
bad,"work overload, no incentives for employees, .overall care for employees is not good, good customer base,to high of a turnover in employees, no room for advancement, to biased,good to make quick money, only hire part time if not in management"
bad,"Hard working employees. Learned a lot on responsibilities on being a key older. Most people were pleasant to work with. Hardest part of the job was dealing with attitudes from store managers, delayed scheduling, unclear set of duties and going against corp orates orders. Met some really great people."
bad,"I loved my customers and fellow employees. I believe that corporate expects too much on all managers, and does not have any respect for there employees. They need to lower there expectations and raise the pay for employees."
bad,Worked there for about a month. The managers are useless and the pay is garbage. They change your schedules and don't even tell you. The managers are friends with certain employees and let them no call and no show multiple times. But if someone wants to leave on the time that is scheduled thats a problem because you must cover for their friends not showing up.
bad,"I was the assistant manager for West frankfort store. For one, that store is a joke. Two, they don't like to pay your final pays. Then they terminate for all the wrong reasons. Got rid of the hard workers but kept the lazy incompetent thieves working. Makes sense right? Yea I thought so too."
bad,Many people who work for the Dollar General are either just out of high school or need a part-time time. Advancements are basically unheard of and the manager I had was extremely rude.
bad,I would stock and straighten out shelves while running the cash register at the same time and I would also clean the bathrooms sweep and mop the floors and wipe down the windows
bad,The manager was very rude to her employees and would take very little time to teach them anything. Also hours were not good. And of any other employee could not efficiently do their job she would hire more employees and cut everyones hours.
bad,The management was horrible always some kind of drama going on in that place also it was never organized and customers constantly complained about it often but nothing was ever done about it.
bad,"Horrible managers and horrible work place. No communtication, broken equipment and too low of pay. It wouldnt be that bad of a store if it wasnt for the store manger."
bad,"A typical day at work was to come in get a cart and immediately start stocking the items. After being trained for two days, I was expected to know exactly where everything belongs. Later on while working for this company I found out the manager was not recording my correct time for my pay. When I questioned this person, she began to get very angry towards me, so much so I decided it would be best if I just leave."
bad,They do not care about their employees. They expect you to work open to close some days. It is not a safe environment. They fire people for no reason at all.
bad,The higher ups don't really care about their lil people they work you to death every shift is under staffed the store managers are rude both to customers and staff
bad,"I had a diffivult time working for Dollar General. Meager wages, unqualified management, no benefits, and cumbersome policies that make it difficult for the average employee. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,Duties were random on a day by day basis and lack of hours towards the end of my employment there.When I was terminated managerb did not have a rational reason why I was let go.
bad,"A very different work environment, something I just wasn't used too company did not work as a team, it was almost like everyone was working against each other."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a place that does not take care of their employees... this is the job for you. I've worked in multiple Dollar General stores and I still cringe when walking into one. I did not feel like a member of a team rather than a replaceable worker. A lack of communication and a lot of 'he said, she said'. Not my favorite job by far."
bad,"this establishment was a horrible place to work for , because the management didnt care about the employees or their needs. the store was always a mess and the workers were not equal. some employees did more than others and the management put down some of the employees and make them feel stupid, as far as the store arrangement was just horrible there was no organization. i feel like the management should have never been made magement."
bad,"This company will just throw you into field without training you or giving you any type of knowledge. Some of the employees are rude and unprofessional. While working there a ""higher up"" employee stole from my till and the general manger did not tell me what was going on."
bad,They don't want to let you off for any reason at all even if you have a doctor note they will make you work anyways. I had to take off for court and when I got back the main store manager approached me and told me to either quit or she was gonna fire me. They don't like to deal with any kind of issues they would rather sweep it under the rug.
bad,This is a terrible company to work for they do not take care of their employees. They've taken away bonuses and do not pay you enough.
bad,"This company does not train you well and does not treat you fair, if you miss for having bronchitis or some other severe cold  with Dr.Notes they will fire you over missing three days, there mangers are sorry and are not trained well. I have done alot of retail but this is the worse i have been treated."
bad,Dollar general gave me the opportunity to grow as a manager and to develop my leadership skills. The benefits are good for employees and there is some room for growth but upper management sometimes does not treat all managers the same.
bad,"my typical day of work was hard ,they don't train like supposed to be done.They expect the women to carry out the job like a man.No structure at all ,to much drama.The pay doesn't doesn't add up to the work you perform.Their is race problem also as well as homosexual problem with people being homosexual."
bad,"management is horrible "
bad,Great hours...pay...great environment..team work....easy work....great store hours..love shopping there...opportunity to meet new people....learn alot
bad,"They treat there employess badly. They work you hard and pay next to nothing, and family you can forget.  You spend more time at work then you do with family or at home.  Forget taking payed vacation time off, they find a way to always have you working."
bad,"Not a good place to work. The whole management is messed up starting with the CEO. there is no hours to be given out, sometimes there was week's where we would have to split 110 hours among 8 or 9 employees. Making min wage at 7 hours a weeks wont cut it.  very greedy company."
bad,"Typical day at work: running around like a chicken with it's head cut off."
bad,When I first started working there the management and some co-workers we're stealing Dollar General products and money. Then management changed and things got better until surgent managers we're giving attitude and not doing their job because they were afraid of Confrontation. Overall not a bad job if you don't want a social life or need one.
bad,"Horrible disgusting store standards, they try to promote within only to create work mules, not very intelligent,  poor grammar,  promoted to a poor salary just to increase duties and responsibilities."
bad,employees are always working off the clock. There is never enough cashiers on for the store to operate successfully and to provide the customer satisfaction that the public deserve
bad,never received a raise or benefits after a year.. Not a good company or work envirnment. No health benefits or help with anythinh
bad,Just straight up not a good place to work unless you're willing to age 10 years quicker and watch your health deteriorate!! Their main objective is to save the company money so anyone who's ever worked for a place like that should know the employees who's helping them get rich don't mean anything to them. Nobody will ever make a career their because at some point in your tenure you WILL be fired! Supervisors are just role fillers and want to be dictators because they have little to no knowledge of how to run their department which in turn causes you to work a lot of overtime including your off days. Just a terrible place to work. If you plan on working here then i suggest that you sign up for 401k because the good thing is that they will match your contributions by 10% and the money accumulate very quickly. Sign up for it because like i said at some point you will be fired and that 401k will help you financially until you find employment somewhere else
bad,I am a 3rd key and I have been with the company 3 years and I have been trying to advance but lack of manager turnover and DM turnover or Manager for kiss the DM behind or vise visa happens. I tried everything from trying to transfer out to make the situation better but the DM and Store manager refused to let me go. Store manager turnover and also cashiers.
bad,I worked at the dollar general in sachse Texas store 7105 to be exact and my experience there was horrible. Between the boss not being able to keep up with staff missing days they were supposed to work and being understaffed and the pay being garbage it just left a bad taste in my mouth about working in retail all together.
bad,They promise you to much and never follow through.  There is NO rule that has not been broken or that you will be instructed to break by field management.  They expect you to be there slave.  You will have Zero personal life!  They will even try to call you back off of vacation if something happens.  They love to threaten your job!!!
bad,"Minimum wage and low hours keeps most employees working two jobs. "
bad,"The store manager has complete authority over everything. The district manager will have the store managers back no matter what. I don't recommend working for Dollar General unless you like to deal with "
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for this company. They treat you very poorly. They will work you to death for little pay. It is not worth losing your time.
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. Don't bother applying. "
bad,I won't even consider telling someone to get a job at Dollar General. This place thinks salary exempt means they own you and you should work your life away at 60-70 hours per week.
bad,This is the most dysfunctional company I have ever worked for. They need to rethink their whole process about everything.
bad,"Dollar General does not have many opportunities to advance and very low pay...even for high members of management. Moreover, they offer very few hours whether you are full-or part-time."
bad,"people at dollar general will want to get so much for so little "
bad,"I  had the duties of opening and closing the store, setting up planograms, counting down registers, assisting customers, zoning the store and stocking merchandise."
bad,They have motos but no one follows them. There is no team work. The ones that do their job end up leaving because they are doing all the work.
bad,"The manager was not an understanding person. She would get mad for stuff that you did not do, and had you running around like a chicken with your head cut off while she did nothing."
bad,fun job to move up in a career very productive is a learning experience job easy access to a learning position all of the coworkers were friendly we all got along
bad,"i did not like how things was running , they was very poor at giving you the hours you needed let along giving you any hours at all, then service their was also very poor witch to me is kinda weird cause from the outside looking in i never thought that if i was to actually apply that it would be horrible , cause i always got great customer service before i started working their , and once you work there its almost as if you didn't matter at all, you was just some employee , nearly getting paid for the time you worked and for even being their at all...."
bad,"managers have no work life balance it is impossible when you are expected to work 60 to 70 hours a week, yes not every state is the same but for the most part they expect you to run the store with as little employees as possible meaning you will have times where you open by your self, cashiers get under 14hrs a week, asms do not get paid enough for the work that is expected and managers do not either."
bad,They care nothing about the employees. Four stores have been robbed in the area and they have done nothing to ensure our safety. They wont even install decent cameras so the police can get a clean shot of the suspects face. They also have no cameras in the parking lots. We are open all day on Thanksgiving and if we ask off they tell us to bad. They promote the ones who dont do their job and punish the ones that do. Would not recommend anyone to seek employment with Dollar General.
bad,"Management is poor,store is filthy and unorganized,schedule changes without knowledge.H ow can you be a cashier and put stock out with customers in store and still be at the register.Management always works with 5 employees during day,but at night only 2. Working 6 straight hours without at least 10 mins. Is Unacceptable."
bad,i got fired for not coming in a day i  wasn't  scheduled to work and they didn't even call me to come in . i learned sometimes things happen for a reason. the store was not safe and if someone got hurt they will be shut down.
bad,"Management doesn't keep any promises.  The pay is way too low for the job that you are given.  The safety of the employees are not the company's priority,"
bad,Most of my colleagues are decent. Work is very stressful and unreasonable. I don't shop there due to Handling of products. Always short staffed due to low hours. Lots of favoritism. Overall it's a terrible place to work.
bad,Store management doesn't receive enough payroll to properly run a store.  The company expects you to work by yourself if you are the store manager and they don't want to pay their employees.
bad,"The managers sucks they are never at work, but only come when visitors are coming. The supervisor some are good, but the others will tell your business to people even though you are going through something personal."
bad,"I hated working here, they don't care about their employees at all. We have no mats at the register, so we have to stand on concrete floors for 8 hours straight. I get payed terribly for working weeks straight with no days off."
bad,I would not reccommand this job to anyone it is not what you would think it should be. You have to do so much for so little pay and the DM and SM is all for themselves
bad,I worked for the dollar general store in Pitkin la for 4 months and manager at this store treated me unfair called in sick once and got terminated. I would sure like to know my employee rights and why I was fired unfairly without any reason I also plan to seek more into this unfair situation! Manager there is a crook
bad,"This place is one of the worst I've ever worked at. The management has no regard for any staff except themselves, the customer service from the management is disgustingly bad. I'm ashamed to have to be apart of the Sales Associate staff."
bad,"Worked 5 shifts as an Assistant Manager. They expected me to know how to open and close the store by the 3rd shift. I have over 12 years Retail Mgmnt experience, and I have never seen a company with expectations such as this."
bad,"They don't schedule enough employees to run the store properly. Store and upper management are no help in resolving any issues, customer or employee related."
bad,This company  does not care about anything but money. It will not help you with aything and you have no life out side of working here. They want to much form to little
bad,"Dollar General as a whole might be a good place for deals..however the store I worked in was the worst place I have ever worked in EVER!! No direction at all on a daily basis!! No teamwork whatsoever . Assistant manager who was manager on duty when I worked barked orders at us AND FREQUENTLY put us down in front of customers. On the first week I was there I was left alone in the store at night and my husband was asked if he could stay with me as this wasn't a ""safe"" area!!!! I could go on and on but too much crazy junior high or shall I say elementary behavior🙄😂😂"
bad,they have absolutely stupid policy's when it comes to their employees. they are more worried about the employees stealing then they are about customers. avoid working for dollar general
bad,"I have been working at Dollar General Distribution Center for about a year and a half and for the most part, I love working here. My only issues with this job is it's manager management and how they sometimes show favoritism or try to target people leading to its high overturn rating."
bad,I worked for Dollar General for 3 years and was only allowed to advance up to a Keyholder dispite my great work and team spirit. I worked every single weekend for 2 years straight with holidays included. No overtime and no benefits unless you are full time. It was just dreadful.
bad,they drive a slave ship and the store managers are hung to dry the only people living the good life are store managers that have a corporate office in their store or some kind of important person office in their store
bad,Working there was terrible. The manager expect you to do so much while she sit around in the office gossiping about her own employees
bad,i got let go for $2.01 over and got black listed for it and they write you up for things like that and now they refuse to hire me back i could understand if i stole from them but i was over not under
bad,"company cares not for employees and rather point the blame at lesser individuales then take the blame for their own mess ups, requires you to become a drone for the company and if you refuse to reform to their way of bs they will just replace everybody on the staff in favor of good little slaves."
bad,"was my first ever job loved every minute of it, the only problem I had was with the manager she was very mean and bipolar. Wish they were still open loved the burgers"
bad,"Horrible company. Works you to death without compensations. Long hours, low pay, and no benefits. Poor training and management styles. They either work you to death or not at all."
bad,The company sucks they give no hours and the managers back stab all the employees. The pay is way under paid for the amount of work they expect. For every position you have to train yourself and there is no one you can speak to or trust.
bad,I could not make enough money to survive. the managers could not give me the hours I needed because of the company budget. I never felt the jobs security with this company .
bad,Good co-workers but the company itself is horrible don't get to many hours only 2 people a shift but expect to do the work of 4 people. They do not train their employees well. If you have any issues on a register they automatically accuse you of wrong doing and the management is horrible they do not care how the store looks and won't give you the hours to properly recover it and the pay sucks.
bad,"Working for Dollar General has not been a very pleasant experience. The overall responsibilities that are given to an understaffed store seems overwhelming for most. From cleaning the parking lot, stocking every cooler throughout the store and so on. However, the biggest issue would be management. The management is unorganized. Due to scheduling, it is impossible to keep plans as the management leaves whenever they please often calling in people early, only to cut those hours later in the week due to unforeseen circumstances. Overall, Dollar General should not be a career choice."
bad,If you make your manager mad everyone will be mad at you as well. I worked at two stores I got wrote up because I called in because my dad had a heartache. It was a very petty store. If you and the manager got into it the assistant manager wanted to act Petty and not talk to nobody. To much drama.
bad,"A typical day of working for Dollar General is very interesting and long. "
bad,"HR lies constantly no home life they expect way to much no training for new employees"
bad,"Management does not train you for the job  they throw you into a job you are not prepared for; and they expect you to just do the job.  I was left to close the store by myself and I had never even closed with supervision.  It was very stressful.  There is alot required, and no support.  "
bad,"Dollar General does not appreciate their employees and encourages a high turn over rate. In my time with the company, the stress level was so high that I saw three store managers and one district manager either step down or leave the company due to health issues related to stress. The salaries are a joke, as are the benefits. As a store manager, I worked 36 hours straight on more than one occasion."
bad,"Working for dollar General was a very difficult environment to adapt to. The people I worked with were very difficult to work with me, there was no job security at all."
bad,"The job itself was a typical cashier job. Nothing more, nothing less. What really lead to me giving this company a terrible review was the management. Our manager was absolutely terrible at making schedules. I, and other employees would give him days/weeks of notice when we could not work, and it would very rarely be taken into consideration when writing the schedules. We commonly would not know our schedule until the start of the work week, sometimes the very morning of. This gave us very little to no time to learn the hours we would work. Some work weeks were 25+ hours, some were one, five hour shift. I missed work two times in 6 months and was terminated. Prior to the last missed day, my hours had been cut back from 3-5 days, to 1-3 days for a solid two weeks. Most of the hard work was pushed on to other managers. While the store was busy, our manager would commonly sneak into the back and be unavailable for assistance."
bad,The company and management have unrealistic expectations from their staff. My store is understaffed and has new employees. There is a steady flow of customers through a shift. Cashiers are expected to be chained to the register and straighten the front 30 feet of the store or unload a lot totes. It's only possible for seasoned employees to get done.
bad,A typical day at work means being yelled at by customers. Having stuff thrown at me. Stocking shelves. low pay and low hours. Terrible management. Definitely not where i'd recommend working even for only part time.
bad,Not enough hours to deal with. Job security is not their thing they worry about the almighty dollar. I like to keep busy so their was always something to do.
bad,I loved working towards a goal and completed it and setting and breaking records. What I hated most were management team and employees and work environment.
bad,My time with dollar general was good at first. When you are new everyone is nice but after a while the start to call you in on all your days off and the first time you say no they cut all your hours.Everything is always the little guys fault nothing falls on the manager.
bad,The only part of my job I enjoyed was interacting with the regular customers. They were very respectful and nice to talk to. Management treats you horribly and they only promote people that will be okay with being treated bad and not complain about them. They expect you to be cussed at and harassed by some customers. When you do complain they will cut your hours and do whatever they want.
bad,"Dollar General is not a good employer, they do not give you enough payroll budget hours to complete the tasks that need to be completed in the stores, therefore the managers are working 60-80 hours a week, and these stores are always trashed because there is no time to clean or recover, yet Dollar General expects impossible standards, with no help.  You cannot tell anyone anything.  Everything falls on deaf ears.  All they care about is profit and how much there executives will get for a bonus at the end of the year.  There is no incentive to work here.  They do not care about anyone.  You are just a number."
bad,I help own the store on norwood. It was a bad company always kept saying the stealing was cooking from within. But customers wild fill up their baskets and run out. The DM never wanted to get security for the store. Would risk the lives of their employees for a darn dollar. If you were to ask me if you should apply. My honest opinion is turn around and run the other way. Not worth the headache.
bad,This a job for teenagers to gain experience. This is not a job that gives you any benefits or opportunities for advancement. Many days I was not even able to take a break because of lack of other employees.
bad,They done me wrong hurt my back and was doing what they asked and they terminated me and I worked overtime and was a dang good worker.I have worked all my life since 1994 and never have worked for a company when your drawing workmenscomp when you are trying to get better they terminated me
bad,"I highly dislike working here because Dollar General is very selfish & does not care about their employees work state/environment.  We have no air/heat, bad management, horrible customers."
bad,"A typical work day at dollar general differs on which shift you work. For example if I work in the morning I would normally come in and count the tills and safe, check payroll,emails etc. I would also make a game plan on what needs to be done for the day, factoring in lunch breaks and sales. If I were to work the closing shift I would come in and count morning shifts tills,change over to night shifts tills. At night we would mostly make sure our store is cleaned and stocked for the next morning. That includes recovering the store,sweeping,mopping, cleaning the bathrooms,cleaning the parking lot,collecting carts,and most of all making sure all of our customers have a nice experience in the store. I believe the hardest part of my job is making sure all the thieves in the store I work in are caught,my store I am currently working in has a lot of crime, it does make a day at work difficult when you have crime going on all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is having all the regular customers come in everyday and tell you that they love the store and will always come back."
bad,"This job is unprofessional , the manager is not like a typically manager someone would have.This is a high crime area. Customers comes and steals as they please. Most of the workers there are from the area. some allow their family to come steal from time to time"
bad,"Excessive hours, low wages.  Workplace had an extremely negative environment despite trying to improve this.  Lack of help doing many physical tasks."
bad,One of the worse places to work. They have great policies and procedures but thy don't follow them and get mad when you do. I've seen many come and go who were great associates.
bad,Awful store manager that was rude to customers and staff. Enjoyed working with customers though.  Never could get enough hours and training was poor to say the least.
bad,"come in and get right to work putting up stock "
bad,"	Preformed all opening and closing management duties "
bad,There is no respect for how much you learn or how much you know.you can have more exp. Then the store manager and you don't get the job they come from somewhere else with no dollar general exp.
bad,"Don't put yourself through this. A terrible company that won't pay you enough, and will have you doing poo work. They will have you move everything on an aisle just to move things one shelf away. Expect that every couple weeks per section. Expect an incompetent boss that will take advantage of you one week and the next they will take money out of your register to try and get you fired. I got fired yesterday because....we had a sell on 12 packs of cokes. Has to be 3 cokes and a lady had a coke, a fanta, and a mountain dew the assistant manager that doesn't know what he's doing told me to ring up 3 cokes and I said I didn't want a write up for it (becaise Ive gotten write ups for less) so i asked him to do it on his register and he sent me home. The next day I go in for my shift and he says I'm no longer with the company.that's right, fired because I wouldn't rip off the company. Garbage. Don't do it unless your desperate and don't mind taking orders from people with an IQ of 3.."
bad,"The district manager is the worst manager I have ever worked for. I can literally say that she got me to the point that I don't want to be a store manager anymore. All she did was micromanage everything that we did. Called all my staff theives to their face and forced me to write people up for stupid reasons because the district manager doesn't like them. The budget that they give you is ridiculous. They expect you to do everything as a store manager and give your sales associate 4 hours a week and still forcing you to hire more people. I'm sorry, I care about my employees and my customers and want to give them a great place to work and shop but my district manager makes it nearly impossible to do that. Corporate needs to look into this district manager, they have lost 4 store managers in the last 4 months."
bad,"The management was great if you were their friend, but without friendship management was very unfair with hours, pay, overtime, and workload."
bad,Family Dollar has to screen their employees before hiring them into Managers. A lot of Managers are on a power trip. They don't know how to talk to their employees.
bad,"Probably the worst place I've ever worked. It doesn't matter how much you do or how good it is, it's never good enough. Probably the most un-appreciative place I've work and there is no pleasing the District Manager."
bad,very busy work environment. a lot of regular customers. no benefits. a lot of meth heads in that area. my co workers were all out to get me fired.
bad,"They treated me nice but did not honor my religion. The store was a mess all the time, and the store was very busy with only two people working most of the time."
bad,"As a key holder, job requirements were physically demanding with no leniency for employees with physical disabilities. I was expected to unload one rolltainer every hour"
bad,"This place was very unprofessional...... Management was completely unprofessional and unavailable. Promising promotions an raises, but only giving the extra workload with no extra pay. I learned to function the entire store on my own."
bad,It's part time and very low paying job I need a full time job. I have learned nothing at that job. the hardest part is the money I make. The most enjoyable part is when I leave to go home.
bad,dollar general is not a good place to work if you have kids. and also they dont want to give you hours either. hardest prt about it is dealing with the mangers bad attitudes
bad,did not like the job at all terrible customers service managers were very snobby never gotten an example of how things  work in the store  I was very unsatisfied with the job
bad,"Very fast paced. Company overworks all of their employees and managers do not have time for a life. District Manager is very negative and does not have any good to say. Will always point out the negative. Company says the are family orientated but yet they sell cigarettes, alcohol, and magazines with nudity (Sports Illustrated Swim Suit Edition). Pay is very low but the company expects each employee to constantly be on the run."
bad,You are paid minimum wage and get little hours but are expected to do everything. It keeps you busy but definitely not a career or a job you can support yourself working. The whole aspect of the company  policies almost makes you feel like your assumed to be a theif or a dishonest person. A cashier cannot void a single item or do really anything without a manager over ride which makes things difficult because there is only 2-3 people there at a time. The store i worked at the manager was so rude to customers and treated them like they were a bother to her and having to come to the front to assist with a transaction like a void nobody but a manager can do per company policy was a terrible inconvenience...
bad,Horrible company. Typical day at work was cashing out customers restocking the store.Cleaning when the store closed.
bad,"A typical day at work at Dollar General would include being short staffed all the time, so doing numerous work tasks that couldn't be completed in a nights work was always on the schedule. I learned that there would be no days off, even if you had other obligations (such as school) that you needed time off for. Plus, working FT hours on PT benefits was also a negative. The management was poor and very rude. My co-workers seemed to always get weekends off along with management if you had a second job as an excuse. The hardest part of the job was doing everyone's work while the manager sat on the phone for his entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I finally had enough and quit."
bad,I work at a Dollar General now and let me tell you I was warned by people that the Management is mean. They are very rude to their employees and training is horrible. If they show you once how to do something you are expected to get it right away. Not a comfortable place to work. Key holders get minimum wage and are working as management doing the same job. Do not work there
bad,The store i worked at in columbia has poor hours and awful management didnt know how to treat people fairly never got promoted always got talked about to other employes which should never be done in a work enviroment always got blamed for other peoples mistakes and things they did not do.
bad,"Was not treated fairly, management was horrible. Pay was horrible, increases yearly were none to minimal. Managers always took sick leaves and no increase to do Managers Position for 6 months plus."
bad,"I have never hated working for a company as much as this one. Dollar General is a terrible place to work for. Store Manager just sits in her office and takes PERSONAL calls all day, while ignoring all the others. I was paid minimum wage being forced to do the Store Manager's job because she was too lazy to."
bad,"Dollar General is in the Top 10 worst companies to work for, and boy do you learn why very quickly. If they tell you that you will be full time, don't expect more than 30 hours a week. As an assistant manager I still only got 30 hours and made only $1 over minimum wage. Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,Horrible Upper Management Staff.  Dollar General as a Company treats their employees horribly.  They don't care about their employees only themselves.
bad,"Manager(AL) talks down to you, like if you're not able to process what he's saying. Also talks in an aggressive way to employees while at the presence of a customer. Manager follows woman unprofessionally by staring at their behind. No one helps out when in need and if they do they throw a fit. Get 12+hours worth of tasks but have 6-7 hours to do it. Close to no pay for to much responsibility."
bad,they have your bonus base on shink and dollar general has the worst shrink because you are always by yourself.So you have zero chance of getting  a bonus.
bad,worst job ever poor management they were lazy nothing was ever done right insde of the store. the only good thing about it was your co workers.
bad,its not much to say about the job and the management skills i've experience with the company but the management is horrible and the general manager of the region is not friendly at all
bad,"Store was always messy, no matter the efforts applied.  Management was inconsistent and unfair.  breaks were cut to a inappropriate low amount of time"
bad,"Key holder for that night used my till and i got fired for it, manager was rude and was fired in front of another store manager. was very embarrass. never work here"
bad,modern day slave labor I was working 80 hour weeks with no compensation or days off management will step over anyone to get ahead they are sexist raciest lazy ignorant and don't care about your own personal well being I did not like working for a company which hires a new boss every three months for unforeseen reasons watch out!
bad,my typical day at work wasn't fun my co-workers weren't working as a team was always something they were gossiping about .i didn't like the vibe at work everyone was nice to each other but also talking about one another. here was always cursing on he floor were we dealt with our costumers. thats my typical day at Dollar General.!
bad,"I loved helping customers find what they needed. Provided excellent customer service."
bad,"Slow, boring, frusterating, lack of hours, hard to hear through the headsets, and the man's voice was foreign sounding and made him hard to understand. I always met my quota though."
bad,Changed management every week providing a horrible job culture for the people that work there. Management does not treat you right.
bad,"its a hard company to work on very high turn over. I did not stay very long. it was bought by kbr while i was working for it. It was a Cal Turner company originally, he died and family sold it."
bad,"all i can say i had terrible experience working for Dollar General, i'd work for 5 hours a week, making $7.25 an hour, and the business was too slow"
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. They expect one or two employees to do the work of several, and no matter what you do it is never good enough. We had several stores in our area robbed and our District Manager never even acknowledged it. There is no concern for employee safety. Our store manager maybe worked 30 hours a week leaving others to pick up the slack in her absence. "
bad,"No recognition for hard work.  Hours are not good.  Raises are not given, despite hard work.  Coworkers call out all the time and you are expected to drop everything and come in - this happens far too often."
bad,"This company is beyond a joke!"
bad,"Like other people stated above. Horrible environment no training  thrown to the wovles extra long hours. No home life. They promise you bonuses etc. It rarley happens. They tell you to hire people and try to keep them on only giving them 14. Hrs a week for $7.25 an hour. No wants to stay for that paying wage and amount of hours. Left by myself with no one on scheduled in a ghetto store with very high shrink. . I Would have lines of 20+ people yelling at me why i was alone on the register because we had no help and were told not to hire anyone because of down season. I left a job I liked making less in hopes of there false promises of a really decent wage and"""" Great Company to work for.""""Worst carrer move ever !"
bad,Dollar General was an ok experience. The management is very unorganized and some managers are really mean. some of the co workers made the experience better. I would not recommend this store to anyone unless they make some changes.
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever worked.  The people are mostly nice but some just have sour attitudes about the poor condition of the store.  The store is always dirty, no matter how much you scrub.  The co-workers were not nice and everyone kept to themselves, which is why you'd never know when you worked because management wouldn't tell you if you were a student."
bad,"All I can say is do your research on this company. In Dickson county or any or region which you may live in, go around and talk to the folks that work here. You will hear the same song and dance every time. The turnover rate is outrageous, that is a tell tell sign my friends. Run and run fast from this sad company. One more thing look at the reviews giving 4 an 5 stars, saying they work 70 hours a lot times by themselves, truly sad state of affairs when they complain of no budget, no help from their DM, no days off, but give a rating like that, good little sheep."
bad,Very demanding company and not grateful. The benefits are high in cost. There was never enough coverage and the company did not authorize hours to cover the store.
bad,"As being one of the four people who left in the same week, I wouldn't recommend my old job to anyone. My co-workers was great, but the management had a way of sucking life out of you"
bad,Got the feeling that this store was not important to the corporation. and pay so low that no one seems to want to work there
bad,I JUST RECENTLY quit at a dollar general. The company is a joke. They do not pay enough for the work that we have to do. They never appreciated that we make them over 4 million dollars a year. And for the district manager to come in and call us employees stupid and lazy and corporate doesn't do nothing about it. I would never recommend working at the dollar general to even a dog
bad,"Really didn't like working for the company their was always something going on, really didn't have any support as far as management go, didn't have anyone you could trust. try reaching out to the district manger and he never responded to any of my email or concerns. I wouldn't recommend any one work for this company unless its in another district other than Albany Ga."
bad,the management sucks all the customers are rude and the manager was unfair and always yelling at me and lazy. don't work for this company they expect a lot out of you for lousy pay!
bad,"Not enough coverage for all shifts"
bad,My experience with Dollar General was like walking the plank.  The was no support from upper management since the majority of my time with Dollar General I had no DM to ask for support or help.
bad,"by far worse company i ever worked for once you get hurt for doing your job they treat you real bad. they say they are family oriented but really they are not they don't care about their employees. Also not having a time to leave it horrible not knowing when u are coming home to your family because u can be there 12 hours is by far the worse, they work you like a machine,"
bad,"Working at dollar general, you can not have a personal life. The security was horrible. They do not care about your safety. They simply do not care about their employees"
bad,Tough job. Company thrived through the recession because it did not have to worry about employees leaving . I worked as a district manager. The store were constantly ripped off but upper management refused to accept that answer. They wanted to blame employees . Might be an okay place for a first job but other than that there are much better places to work . No respect what soever
bad,"You get poor pay, poor hours and the management is a joke. It's nothing but drama. I took the job because I was told I would move up because of my experience yet when a new manager came along, they play favorites and pick people with no experience."
bad,"Management was horrible, barely was given any hours. The people were so disrespectful. The people in charge did not know what they were doing at all."
bad,It's okay but I need more  money.  You should not mind working to do this job.  Constant job duties to do if not cashiering.  I don't understand what you want on the overall rating using the stars above?
bad,"I've been here for almost 4 years.... Since the very beginning at Dollar General Warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama....  And each year it seems things have gotten a whole lot worse.  Night shift is ridiculous!!! They play rap music over the intercom often, supervisors sleep with employees, women wear unprofessional clothing to work, and its clearly obvious the work environment is one sided.....  Some people clearly break the rules and because of their friendship with the supervisors, they do what they want, work when they want.... The good workers get ran into the ground..... Injurys happen more than they report..... They sweep a lot under the rug.  People are promoted who have no business being promoted.... I've seen HR on night shift get drunk at the local bar telling employees business, and the supervisors have constantly been involved in ""drama"" around the warehouse. We are suppose to be working 8 hours only to cut overtime, but if you're ""cool"" with the supervisors you can make your extra money..... Hoping that corporate send an undercover general warehouse employee who can be around for 6 months to see everything, cause the DC Manager don't care, or refuse to do anything about it!!!! Drugs are often in the warehouse and they only drug test people who they want gone..... Not everyone!!!! Guys who smell like Marijuana walk right pass these guys.... They know that, but their friends so they don't care."
bad,"This company is horrible to work for, the training is mediocre, management is unorganized and lacks the ability to provide a productive work experience. You work very long hour getting paid like a slave. Management doesn't seem to care if you have a family and children. You don't get paid your ""clocked hours"". They adjust it so they don't go ""over budget"" regardless of how many hours you work. This job is a joke."
bad,"Dollar general is a terrible company to work for. The management is very unprofessional, and don't known what they are doing. They hire anybody without putting forth effort for research, just so they can be lazy. The pay is pathetic, and its not worth the muscles and headache!"
bad,this is not a good place to work at the manager suck people just keep on stealing out the store it get too busy. It's not fun at all the are there all the time to much things you have to do during you work time and no training at all they just put you in the cash register the first day.
bad,"No room for advancement, no opportunities, and no comfort in teamwork or other. Hostile, rushed, and crunched always. Not a single comfortable day."
bad,A typical day at work is mostly is staying out of my co- workers way because they didn't like me because I don't do the things that they do and I don't get involved in other peoples affairs. The best day is at the end of the work day I get to leave and come to my own space where it is quiet and peaceful.
bad,the only thing i can say is i am not sorry I left . worst job i ever had. The boss was never available . To much lying and no one kept their word. I tryed to do my job.
bad,"If you like being left alone a lot then its a place for you. Management expects to much of the store and cuts the hours to the point that you can't do your job. Never happy with your job performance. Never properly train your other co-workers. Seems that lazy employees succed with the company. Regional president and district manager don't help you do anything or even have respect to return any of your telephone calls or emails. I wouldn't wish anyone to work here. If you like making bearly above minimum wage and then offer you bearly anything extra to be a key holder then this is the place for you. If they offer you a chance for a store manager, I wouldn't hold my breathe on getting it. If you like to work in a nasty store, unsafe working conditions and not getting to many hours to live then its for you........."
bad,No payroll to complete the daily job District manager is always on your back co workers work hard and deserve better can and should be a better place to work
bad,"I loved working at Dollar General , the people that I worked with and the customers will be missed greatly."
bad,"It was very aweful and poor, didn't get much hours, it was very unbalanced, and low pay management wasn't good it was very poor."
bad,This was not a good place to work for. I didn't like how the employees were treated. You were under paid and under staffed.
bad,Throughout my life I have had several jobs and I honestly don't remember this job. I can say I must have liked it the short time I was there because I was not fired.
bad,Its not the place everyone thinks about. Bosses of bosses want everything changed in a drop of a dime but wont give the pay roll nor hired the people to get the job done. They don't pay enough for what they ask of one person to do. If you get hurt or sick they will not work with you but better dismiss you from you job and walk you to your car as if you stole from them.
bad,"This place is the epitome of awful. Managers were slackers and didn't follow their own rules. Schedules were made terribly, scheduled to close one night and open the next morning more than a few times a week was exhausting. Customers were disrespectful and I had to get police involved multiple times. The amount of work these people expect you to do while being understaffed and under stress is outrageous. please, dont work here. its not worth it."
bad,I hate working here. the management sucks and the managers are just rude. The hours are long and I am a college student and I barely have time to do my homework. You work on holidays and the managers always give me attitude even though I do what I am supposed to do.
bad,hours wasn't good. They didn't have enough hour to offer. Had call in all the time i felt like i wasnt done fair. They only work me when nobody else wouldnt work there wasnt no communcation poor management.
bad,"The Main Store Director wanted to give me a promotion to Store Director making inappropriate jesters and suggestions, Innuendos, I don't feel like anyone should endure that type of environment. It is a very low class store, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,One day at the store i felt sick to my stomach.I learn that the manager dont car bout there coworker.The hardest part bout being here its staying awake.But i enjoy my coworker everyday
bad,not a great place to work the general manager will not work with a personal life or other commitments. he refuses to hire students and is very judgemental in the hiring process
bad,"Pay is ridiculous, benefits do not exist, management is a joke, clients/customers are the bottom of the barrel, stores are always understaffed, and hours are horrible.  In a word... REPUGNANT."
bad,"over worked and under paid, it is slave work, u do more work than the store managers, the pay stinks. this job is not for anyone with a family or other responsibilities"
bad,"Expected to work 15 hr days with no support staff, often in building from open to close alone. No breaks on these days, expected to take care of customers, vendors and deliveries alone"
bad,"I worked in the Plymouth, NC store for only six months before I finally left. The manager of this store was very rude, unkind, and abused her rights as a manager. She was/is very unethical, and has no morals, and has even used her manager rights against innocent customers. I loved working with the customers and the other employees of Dollar General. I have learned that not everyone appears to be who they say they are, but to always keep a smile on your face and think positive and be very productive."
bad,"I used to love working here, but lately its gone down hill, sadly. the management isn't very reliable. the pay isn't worth the amount of stress."
bad,"A typical day was you knew that you would stocking the shelves, being a cashier, and waiting on customers. Management wasn't so bad."
bad,"It was fun at first till I learned that the store manager and the other assistant we're friends outside of the job site."
bad,"They reel you in by saying you are required to work only 48 hrs per week. Once you are in, you are required to do 70+ hrs per week. And if you get hurt on the job, you better start looking for another one. They always find the smallest thing to terminate you on after you file a workers comp claim. I enjoyed what i was doing, but i did not have a life for 3 years working for them. Nothing is ever good enough. There are days that i was there 22 hours straight, on numerous occasions to try and get caught up. They always cut your payroll hours and they are always short staffed due to low pay rates."
bad,"The pay is terrible."
bad,The manager there would only hire women because he believed that's what the customers wanted to see. I did not work there for very long.
bad,When you're dealing with the public it can be stressful especially when you have customers who are miserable in their own personal lives. And when don't have the support of management it makes your job more difficult. Don't work here it's not worth the pay find a better job!!!!
bad,Good managers are few and far between with this company. Training is a joke. Pay is small compared to most places. Expect a extreme amount of work done with in a very short period of time
bad,I worked for years for this company. I put them before my famil;y and personal life. I have never had been writtten up in the 3 years that I worked for the company. they switched district managers and in all of one day I was written up 3 times in one day and fired on account that i refused to take responability for someone else actions. hey are unfair and thier expectations are unreachable.
bad,"Bad place to work at. Save yourself some time and humiliation and just work at Walmart, at least they respect their customers and employees there."
bad,Overall the company does not value good employees. On the store level. The work is physical and extremely stressful. The best part of my time at Dollar General was the customers. This company is all about the numbers. They seem to have forgotten that it is the employees on the frontline are the ones making that bottom line profit happened. I would not recommend them to anyone.
bad,"Felt neglected in development consideration and balance of job loyality. I was dedicated to turn around in all sales inventory metric and each of the 3 district managers rated store with high standards, sales metrics positive results, and shrinking overall store operations team and inventory control."
bad,"this was the worst job I've ever had.i would never recommend working for them. if you have a problem you have to go through hoops to get answers. it took 2 months after i quit to get pay stubs I had to call labor board to get them. thing were always blocking exists, I was told i would never open or close by myself and did."
bad,Management is degrading and heartless. No one works like a team or tries to have other employees backs. They're willing to throw anyone under the bus to cover up their own mistakes.
bad,"No time with family, no staff, running on bare bones, store manager responsible for working extremely long hours and awful conditions"
bad,"Stores (Most in and around San Antonio) are rat infested, under staffed, expired product. Upper management wants warm bodies, doesn't care about cleaning up the impacted, rat infested receiving area. You will be blamed for their lack of initiative in cleaning up their mess."
bad,My main reason why I disliked this company was because the manager. I had no one to watch my son so I called and told her I would be late. Next thing I know she is kicking me to the curb.
bad,I did not like working here it was unorganized.. Management was poor got cussed out about everything this is the worst place I have worked.
bad,The first store manager i had was the best one i had out of the 2 years i was there.  She left for a better job a few months after i started.  After she left we had about 4 managers come and go.  There were coworkers i enjoyed working with and didn't have a problem helping when asked for my help.
bad,The company could have been better as well as management but it was a nice first job but i would not like to go back. Great first experience though
bad,"I learned a lot about retail in the short time I worked at Dollar General.  It was my first retail job. Make sure you are physically fit to lift, tug, pull, push, and climb."
bad,"I did not agree with their manager system. I paid the bills for the most part. My co workers were okay non the less. I performed the nessacery duties required, like giving breaks, maintaining store's overall appearance. Hardest part was covering with other co workers would not show up for their scheduled shifts."
bad,A typical day at work there in the short amount of time being employed at Dollar General was terrible all in all. I learned a lot of what I know practically by myself there was barely any training being done from a cashiers' point of view. The co workers were more helpful than the manager ever was. Management was completely unprofessional almost to the point of workplace bullying constant false accusations' the manager was very stand offish and had a very bad attitude and did not treat every employee the same . I would not recommend anyone working there ever unless they like working in this kind of environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers' constant bad attitude towards me. The best part was customer service and helping them to the best of my ability.
bad,"Cashier at register, stock, clean up, customer service, and closing."
bad,"I was responsible for stocking shelves and running the cash register. While working here I never received any paycheck which lead to me quieting, and when i tried contacting the company i never talked to anyone who could help me. Very unprofessional work place."
bad,They push you around like a pig and you get so underpaid even when you get a raise it's terrible. The place is going to trash and they don't realize what they are losing.
bad,"I enjoyed the different parts of the job, but had a very bad district manager and dollar general does not look at both sides of the coin when it comes to discipline someone that's right in front of them."
bad,"I loved working here the first time. The second time it was like the company completely changed. They don't care about their employees, only about making money. I didn't see my family most of the time I worked there."
bad,This was by far the most frustrating work place I had ever worked for as well as unorganized. While I was there for two years we went through almost 5 managers.
bad,"If you get a decent manager they aren't bad. They expect a lot and if you aren't very customer oriented, this place ain't for you, especially if you are the main cashier for the night."
bad,"Working for dollar general was the first job i've ever had and i will never work for them again. The manager gave in so easily to other employees, the put all the heavy workload on me while my coworkers went out for smoke breaks. There was no security so we could have been hurt at anytime. The front doors were broken so they stayed open all the time until closing when we manually had to close them. I hurt myself twice on the job and nobody did anything to help. We were so overrun and so short staffed. The place was absolutely horrendous. I was virtually the only person who cleaned that place with no help from anyone. I do not recommend working for dollar general. I feel all stores of this branch are the same. This one however was the dollar general far down 103rd street in Jacksonville fl. This place should be shut down for good. I was a part time sales associate, but was working over 35 hours a week. With no benefits, no overtime, nothing. I quit after 3 weeks with them after i saw that nothing was going to change. This place should be illegal."
bad,This place is unprofessional. I do not like it at all because they are unfair to their workers by making them work alone and run the whole store for minimum wage money.
bad,Extremely dirty.  Virtually no team effort at any given time.  Management was terrible. no one liked working with each other.  Calling off was nearly impossible.
bad,It is more for younger people jsut getting out of high school. The pay is not great at all u dont get many hours and the benefits are not great at all either. Your lucky to get 20 hours a week.
bad,"I loved my job but working everyday with little to no time off was stressful for my home life. The salary compensation & unobtainable bonus goals were not worth the effect on my home life. I did learn many valuable management skills in the two years as the Store Manager. A typical day at Dollar General consisted of stocking the shelves, running the cash register, daily paperwork, daily cleaning & customer service. The hardest part of my job was getting Corporate support. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. I had some amazing co-workers who I miss dearly."
bad,Pretty much not worth your time. One of the worst companies to work for. The pay is terrible. And good luck expecting anything above store level.
bad,Working for Dollar General was the most unpleasant job I have worked for. The management at the time of me working there was doing his job and wouldn't allow the employee's to do their jobs efficiently.
bad,"Your experience with Dollar General all depends on who you work for. It is an unfair and unorganized company."
bad,"unload the truck stock product working 50 hour a week clean ,manger the money counting the safe gave employee a break check in vendor planogram change front and face dust, manger the hole store when store manger is off/"
bad,"Requires excessive overtime hours, including Saturdays, and then the management complains about all the overtime pay. Very unwilling to be considerate of outside activites and employee families and medical reasons for missing work. So not recommend working for this company."
bad,"typical day was the manager and assistant manager doing all of the work, hardest part of the job was the workload was too much for just one person to handle"
bad,"I would come in an work, stick to myself since no one really talked to each other. The manager was not so easy to talk to and ultimately the reason I stopped working here. The co-workers were nice unless you worked less then they did, there was one worker there that said somethings about me, claiming I was lazy yet he/she only worked 2 to 3 days a week for a few hours."
bad,"I never knew my schedule until the day before the next work week started, manager of the store was never out of the office, I was being told by three different people how to work. Management got frustrated when I needed help. I was told that I didn't work one week, then I got a letter saying I was fired, so I went in to ask about it, and she said that there wasn't enough hours, but the next time I went in, there were four new people working."
bad,"Dollar General, it is what it is! Low pay, no customer service, retaliatory managers, but if you can read you know what you are applying for from day 1."
bad,"The pay was terrible considering what was required of employees. No weekends off. I worked nights and weekends so everyone else could be off. Managers wanted to throw me to the wolves with a full line of customers, while they hung out in the back gossiping. Bad bad bad place to work"
bad,"Hated the company, and no longer shop as a customer, I would not recommend this store as a first time job for anyone.....Good start to experience"
bad,I did not enjoy this job at all. I got fired for not having a place to live at the time. The manager was never there. The assistant manager thought he ran the show and was rude to customers and employees. The other assistant manager was nice and understanding to my situation. The job requires you as a cashier to do all the work and the managers to sit around and do nothing.
bad,"Very simple really.  If you don't mind getting cheated and treated like dirt from upper management, then you will get your fill of all of that at DG, that I can promise you.  I did feel sorry and gave them at least one star rating on each category."
bad,"The WORST!! company I've ever worked for, and if dollar general doesn't make changes in every aspect they will always have people that will quit. There is no future with this company and there is no home,or honor. Its very sad the way they treat their employees, the people who make this company."
bad,Management was horrible. Schedules were bad. No one stayed due to the lack of management in store. Store supervisor Was only interested in other things not the store. No respect for their employees and for the customer's. Store always had carts of merchandize on it & not on shelves. couldn't
bad,customer service is by far the LAST thing they strive for. Employee pay at a mid level entry employee is .10 cents above minimum wage. There is no employee discount. And the benefits are nothing to brag about. Low hours available to each store so store employee coverage is non-existent. long lines and a messy sales floor create extensive l.p. issues. in 20 years of retail experience I have never known any company to care less about there customers and employees then Dollar General.
bad,"Worked 80 hours a week. only paid for 40 hours. I had a great team but a disappointing District manager, who was unsupportive"
bad,"After 3 years as a Store Manager which became a waste of time working for this company which continued to ensure their employees changes are coming, I finally threw in the white flag. This company does not care for their store level employees in any manner. They only allow enough payroll hours to run the store at about half its potential, requiring their store managers to work 6 to 7 days every week totaling from 70 to 90 plus hours a week. As a salary manager for Dollar General expect no time for friends or family and any leisure time you are giving up the day you take the salary position. Upper management continued for 3 years!! to ensure the salary managers changes were company so they would have more of a work/life balance; however, instead during my 3 years my team and I increased sales by almost $400,000 but our payroll hours allowed stayed the same. Over my last year there I would be lucky to have one day off a week and between Sept and Dec my first day off was Dec 25th because the store was closed! Every day I had off between Dec 26th and when I left the company at the beginning of May, I had to use a vacation day just to get a day off. THINK TWICE BEFORE WORKING FOR A COMPANY WHICH CARES SO LITTLE FOR ITS EMPLOYEES"
bad,Poor company to work for.  They do not care about their associates or the conditions of their stores. They encourage sales over given great customer service and look down on associate that put the customers over swinging freight.
bad,This employer I can say at least in New York State Does not support the Military. They do not care about your personal life. They will invade your personal life. They will terminate you if you say you don't support Isis. The pay is low and they tell you to be their slave and try to make you work 80-100 hours a week and you will only get paid for the 40 hours.
bad,"Minimal pay, minimal hours and high output expectations. No clear communication between management, or management and employees. Training is an afterthought. Scheduling consisted of 2-3 days a week, varying shift hours and expectations to be on call. Not worth the stress."
bad,"I had 3 different DM's 2 different RM's."
bad,"working for this company has not been a pleasant experience, store manager is not a good leader and do not use all available payroll dollars so all task cannot get completed due to under staffing, associates are not trained properly, to much product without a home and no concern for employees. My status is full time but I'm scheduled part time hours with no benefits."
bad,Working for this company was ok at first as I was thankful to have a job.  They expect a lot out of their employees for very little pay.  We had to push freight as well as check out customers.  Most of the freight we put up was in the back of the store taking us away from the register forcing the customer to wait atleast 5 mins.
bad,"long and hard, very frustrating and inconsistent on schedules, no work life balance. cannot keep employees due to lack of appreciation"
bad,"One of the worst places to work, no advancement options, manger was horriable and was stealing everyones hours, nasty place to work"
bad,Not a good place to work there is no training when you get a job you are just thrown into the position. The company does not do very good at noticing what their employees do and the hard work they put into it.
bad,the pay did not match the hours of hard work that was put in it had no guide lines for store management to balance work and home there was not enough hours in a day to complete all the task at hand
bad,"coworkers were ok for the most part"
bad,From management to the employees no one wants to work that's what we get paid to do and when things are going wrong in the store no one wants to take responsibility everybody was blaming everybody
bad,"the company itself arnt very fair to their employees,and they don't have enough staff for the amount of work we had to do,"
bad,"The job didn't pay well...AT ALL!! The job sucked! The organization just didn't pay well enough in order to keep employees. Then, some of us were laid off! I was one of the few!"
bad,"very disorganized company to work for. very poor management, make a lot of promises that are not met. not very considerate"
bad,"this place is horrible. the pay is poor, they are under staffed and administration are SNAKES! HR will tell you to do one thing within COMPLIANCE of rules...however your DM can come in the following day and fire you because you made a complaint? PLACE IS A JOKE!"
bad,Dollar general is not a place to work when trying to obtain your education. When I first started I was there daily  and sometimes worked double shifts for a whole week.
bad,They expect you to work 13 hours a day 7 days a week. ZERO work/life balance. They ignore labor laws and managers work their employees of the clock. The district managers have 20 stores and can't handle that much (respectively). They trained me for one week and had me open a new store. The payroll hours are a joke for the amount of things that need to be done daily. Employee morale is extremely low. Pay increases for associates annually are $0.50 if they are outstanding... Nobody gets that rating so you can't keep quality associates. Don't waste your time...
bad,The company simply does not provide Store mangers the resources they need to succeed.  The business model is as such that there is no conceivable way that a store manager can properly run a store without working 60+ hours per week
bad,As a store manager there is no work/home balance. Associates are held accountable for each situation separatly so they can have over 23 write ups and still work. The store manager is held accountable for associates and do not do receive no extra time for training or fixing issues. district managers don't have to respond. If it take them weeks or months you still have to wait. No sense of urgency with this company.
bad,"Checking out customers"
bad,"The customers were awesome!! The vendors were nice."
bad,"The management at my particular branch was not the greatest. I was never taught anything and just had to get in trouble every time I made a mistake and learn from those moments.  The became upset with me because I am in college and I'm taking 15 credit hours and I have another job so they decided to just not give me hours at all.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the store because nobody else did their part in keeping it clean.  My co-workers were all mean  (with the exception of 2) and they were all 40+ with no education which is why they didn't like the fact that I had another job. We were always hiring because nobody stays. Also you can't really move up.  either you a sales associate, lead sales associate, assistant store manager or store manager. No chance of a raise.  So if you're 16 when you first start and you work there for 20 years and you're still a sales associate, you'll be 36 still making min. wage. I honestly really liked it at first but I can definitely see how it turns into a dead end job."
bad,"Way behind in all aspects of retailing"
bad,"My personal experience at the Dollar General was bad. They do not treat employees right, they would rather hire somebody off the street rather than having an employee actually advance and get promoted. The pay is not nearly enough to live off of. The hours were crazy and not set. The manager and assistant manager never worked nights and when they were at work all they did was sit in the office and talk badly about people."
bad,"The best part about working for the Department of Corrections was the job security and potential for job advancement. But, the majority of the time I worked at Northpoint I worked 16 hour shifts every few days."
bad,Typical day was hoping you had enough people come to work to do the job day in and day out. I learned how to step back and take a breath and not take the stress home. Direct Manager was amazing but the others were not around much. Co-workers were lazy and beat down.
bad,"If you are a single person with no other responsibilities, this job just might be ok, but if you have any kind of education you will see right through all the double standards.  You will work close-open shifts, be called in with almost no notice, and deal with the rudest customers on the face of the planet.  The work load is unrealistic; it simply can not be done if there are customers in the store at all, much less if the store is slammed.  The wage is not enough for the work level you are expected to produce."
bad,Worst job I have ever had. We ended up with only four employees all working 40+ hours a week and I had to take over as an assistant manager but did not receive a raise or a pay increase although I was doing a job above the pay grade I was at.
bad,The real dollar general man would be ashamed if he knew what happened in his stores. They like to play the blame game even when you are not the culprit. New dm attacks you in front of other employees and then tries to blame you for what the actual store manager did not do. Mind you now you are a candidate so why do you have to take the blame because the store manager is quitting. Also he falls into the gossip game and believes everything he hears. No consideration for anyone! I have been in retail many many years and this is the worst company I ever worked for thus far.
bad,"not a good company to work for, hard to move up, and very unorganised."
bad,"Management system, depending on the location, can be horrible. There is no sympathy or compassion for the employees health and well being is more important to be at work."
bad,"Worst Job ever, they did not offer any hours, and the management was lazy. Compensation wasn't enough for all the work that they provided for cashiers to do."
bad,In order to be successful at Dollar General you basically cannot have a life outside of Dollar General. Your availability has to be open whether your part time or full time. I have small children and also very active in church and it seems Dollar General doesn't care about any of that. Its either work the hours they give you or don't work at all.
bad,Dollar General is not the best place to work trust me. I would work 40 hours a week and would only get paid for 20. I would get a 15 minute lunch break and always worked open to close.
bad,"East texas district is horrible. The district manager is a gossiper and a liar. Regional manager tells you to stop working 80 hours a week and District tells you to either do it or walk out the door. They treat their employees like they are disposable. I have never seen a dirtier company than this. "
bad,"Not enough people that work to get the truck out. Manager would yell at you in front of customers, pointing in your face, and threaten your job when ever she felt like. Some of the co-workers were nice and new how to work together, some co-workers would go out side and talk about other employees and laugh about them."
bad,"after 2 months, I only have about at most 8 hours total.  I keep calling for my schedule but don't get through. they say call back tomorrow.  I call back and get delayed other day."
bad,I would never recommend anybody to work here. The hours suck. They barely promote. Terrible pay
bad,"Cashiers do more work than keyholders and management yet get paid less,  hardly any hours, stuff was always breaking, and when I gave my notice they proceeded to tell people I just walked out!  Privacy policy broken! Would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,Some of the managers there are unfair with the hours given and unprofessional. Most of the other coworkers are pretty descent. I have learned how to deal with different personalities from this job.
bad,the first thing u do when u come in is clock in then go straight to work. they really wasn't about employee development. had only few coworkers that was pleasant to work with. Dealing with management .That it gave me job experience which it was my first.
bad,do not work here they don't have any core values in there customers just on making money the middle management is a joke.
bad,I got the job to save money right after I graduated. I started shortly after graduating high school.
bad,"I was worked like a mule.  A majority of the work was left for me to do alone and if I didnt complete the work that night I was written up. I  had to beg for one day off to attend my family reunion when I asked a month ahead.  My superiors were hateful and rude and even called me ""Yall people"" being that I am of African American decent this highly offended me. I would never work for this company again."
bad,overall a very bad experience i was accused of stealing when all along it was the store manager doing it.
bad,"a typical day at work for me was being in a high theft neighborhood where everyday, I had to work the first 3 to 4 hours by myself because the company does not give you enough payroll. This was very unsafe and required me to work ALL day to get tasks done when I finally got a cashier in so I could get off the register."
bad,I was told 48 hours a week and if I worked over that I could take extra time off. Well they didnt like that and to get all that is expected of you with the limited and I mean very limited payroll and people you have to work A LOT of hours. Just way to much to do with no help.  My job was posted and people being interviewed two before I was ever written up or talked to about any problems.  Not very professional way to go about letting a person know they needed to do better.
bad,"*Very busy and not enough time "
bad,"horrible place to work. horrible bosses, horrible management in general"
bad,not a very good company to work for because it was a lot of long hours got paid a salary supposed to work 44 hours a week ending up being around 60-70 hours a week
bad,"This was a minimum wage retail job. It was very basic. The position involved cleaning and restocking the store, working at the cash register, and customer service."
bad,"got injured because of my job, got denied workmans comp. then they terminated me."
bad,"Manager has no control of inventory, poor manager salary(poverty level), no employee discount, no sick days for FT employees, 75-80 hour work weeks (6 day), grossly inadequate payroll budget, constant turnover, poor communication"
bad,a typical day was walking in and the managers were constantky fighting and taking it out on the customers i would always have to resolve the problems between them everyday
bad,"you have no set schedule when you come in to work, schedule is usually set on the first day of the new work week. most of the time, you'll end up closing the store. they take other people who are the same level as you, as a sales associate, and turn them into Assistant Managers or PSA, which is one step below an Assistant manager. the management prefers women who they can pass on 'favors' for job advancement and job security. When it comes to management, there is a saying, 'too many chiefs and not enough Indians.' everyone thinks that they are the boss and what they says goes. some of the co-workers were okay, but i tried not to meddle. if there ever is a problem, they never want the higher ups to know about it. all they do is sweep it under the rug, so to speak."
bad,"Was not looking forward working with the manager, every other co-worker would say the same."
bad,They care NOTHING about their employees!  No benefits!  I served as a store manager but never got the required raise!  I was threatened with physical violence by another manager and the company did NOTHING about it!
bad,"I was at this job for 10 years or so "
bad,"I was a sales associate, basically a cashier. I was never allowed to get over time, I had to take longer breaks to avoid it. The general manager said they would be flexible with my schedule but never was. They played favorites with the other employees and was a bit sexist. And every time I asked for a day off in advance, I would be denied it."
bad,Managers have no idea what is going on half the time. Don't hire the right people to run the stores.
bad,its not a bad job but very unpaid for what all they expected u to do at the company and don't want to pay u for all your hard work ...
bad,"Not a friendly place to work. Work a minimal of 50 hours a week, DM's harass  the employees"
bad,I hated my  job here. The manager was very mean and refused to work with my schedule
bad,This company is not organized the managers in charge are in their 20's and are always leaving or never show for their shift. Nothing ever gets completed. Customers never get waited on or greeted which has lead to numerous complaints. The store is dirty and unsafe.
bad,"Unloading stock trucks, stocking shelves, assisting customers in finding products or questions an concerns they may have. Maintaining the appearance of the store an parking lot. was stressful at times. A lot of heavy lifting, pushing an pulling."
bad,A typical day was working short handed with customers waiting in line for service. I learned that you can pay your bills working at this place. The management  was the worst. The hardest part of the job was never having enough people to complete your job and the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.
bad,"The customers were the best part..."
bad,Needs more hours and better management. They are bad. Nothing to actually tell
bad,Upper management never helped. I was always short handed management staff and was never helped getting applications in the system. When hired you are told 45-50 hour work week but the truth is its about 90hrs. I was forced to work 36hrs straight one time. They do not value your personal life. My wife was in the hospital and i lost my apartment in a fire and was not aloud time off.
bad,"unfair work practice and the hours were very low, the management was not doing there job correct."
bad,Was at the store most of the time by myself. Had to work on breaks and take unpaid breaks up to 2 hours long without being able to leave. Turnover rate is horrible. Childish people were hired without consequences.
bad,This company work you too hard for little pay. The management is poor and don't respect your personal life. You may always end up working double shifts and not getting the pay for it. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"The Dollar General I worked at was run by a store manager who treated employees like her personal servants. She wanted you there, when she wanted you- regardless of policy, your availability or work standards. Management did not care about you, your life or your needs. Pay was minimum wage, and work was maximum output. There was no respect, no consideration and no chance for advancement."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of operating the cash register, mingling with customers, many of them regulars who were friendly and on a first name basis with me.  When not operating the cash register, I was responsible for unloading stock, performing regular cleaning duties, and facing (pulling stock forward on shelves and general straightening).  "
bad,"No Customer focus, inadequate staffing, required to clock out and keep working. Never ending turnover"
bad,"Worked for 2 months as an asst. manager then went to work one day and decided to quit after a few hours into my shift.....why, you might ask??.....the female store manager, who was married, was sleeping with the married district manager, I suspected the store manager was stealing money as evidenced by the bank deposits always having discrepancies except for the week she went on vacation...hmmm!  (I later learned she was eventually fired/forced to resign once a new district manager was on board...they should have listened to me).  Nonetheless, I didn't want to be caught in the middle of drama for $9/hrs since it was a second job.  I took my degree/knowledge elsewhere.  Company seems to hire the locals with no more than high school diploma/GED or less and satisfied working for low wages to run stores which explains why most stores in Oak Hill/Beckley area look cluttered, poorly merchandised, have too many empty shelves, floors barely get swept/mopped, inventory left in the aisles...I could go on.  At least we got paid every week!!"
bad,"1.Frustrating Sometimes when manager is in a bad mood and that was almost every day."
bad,"Typical day: Show up, clock in, maintain the store-front (Depending on your scheduled duties, this could require cleaning windows, registers, and taking out trash. But you were always required to pull items to the front if they were low or shoved back.) until a customer is ready to check out, ring them up and tell them their total while/after bagging their items, press for donations to literacy fund if they would like or have some change; you were also required to press people to fill out surveys on how their experience was. Any customers that came in with a backpack or other bag was told to leave it by the register. The store had a cigarette case so you were required to ask for ID every single time because the register pressured for a birth-date, regardless of if they look older than 30. You were required to use a C.A.O.-like machine to get price checks even though the register had a 'Price Inquiry' key but you were written up if you ever used this function (supposedly because the register would ring it up as a sale). The register would require you to do 'cash drops' if your total came up to about $200.00 inside the register bank. Co-workers would get too social in front of customers and talk poorly of each other. After closing, you were required to sweep and mop the entire store as well as making sure items were up in front on the shelving."
bad,"It is really obvious there that the higher-ups do not appreciate the little people. If you frequent the same Dollar General, you will notice a high turnover of employees. This is not a good sign. They can't keep anyone."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone based on my experiences here. Training is practically non-existent, pay is extremely poor. Employee turnover is very high."
bad,"A typical day at work in staying busy, providing excellent customer service, and accurately counting money. The management wasn't too good, the hardest part of the job is rude customers and I loved to stock."
bad,"This was a job that was held over the summer where I was cashier and stalker. Learned how to handle money, as well as to stock. My co-workers were nice people. Hardest part of the job was stocking a lot by myself because we were short of employees. Most enjoyable part was seeing the customers happy."
bad,"I learned Management, Office skills, more Customer service skills"
bad,minimum wage with no semi monthly or yearly raises. Working less than 20 hours with a big work expectation
bad,"I was hired on 6/5/2014.  My first week, I worked 17.75 hours and I have only been paid for 8.5.  I was told I would receive the rest of my pay today, but I didn't.  I was hired for full time key holder position, was  put into cashier position and have never received more than 21 hours per week.  Schedule for Saturday is never finished until late Friday night.  They tell me they will text me my schedule, but I have never received a text from them.  I always have to call on Saturday morning to find out if I work or not.  I am forced to work 6 hours without a lunch break (illegal).   I have the only register and have to ring up snacks and drinks for all other employees, but I have to work my 6 hour shifts without a drink or snack, because  they won't put anyone else on a register to ring me up and I can not ring myself up.  I have been lied to by 2 assistant managers (one told me she was the store manager, when in fact she is not) and by the store manager.   I have called HR to try to get the rest of my pay and they won't help.  Employees are not allowed to talk to anyone in payroll.  It has to be the store manager or district manager and they are not doing it.  I contacted the local news station and they are going to help me get my money.  I also reported them to the Labor Board for not giving me lunch breaks, which I am suppose to get by law.  I am sure I will probably be cut down to just a couple of hours a week now, but there is a whistle blower law, and if that happens, I will see them in court.  I have given them more than enough chances to try to make it right and nobody"
bad,"When I started working for the company I was promised things, i never received! The works work way to hard for the wage they pay!"
bad,it was ok. not the best job in the world would not go back there again lol
bad,worst job you could ever have. allot of turnover. management only got paid around 8 per hour
bad,"I got hired about 10 days ago but have worked for 7 days. The Store Manager expected me to learn everything in less than 2 weeks. The store was in such a mess even before I started and even during I started. They don't keep enough people on duty to fix the mess in the store. Shoppers keeps complaining that the shelves are missing the items they needed and can't find them because the merchandise are still in boxes and totes."
bad,Their management team stabs in the back every chance they get.
bad,Never a consistent amount of hours. No room for advancement.
bad,Everything was Great I was an Assistant doing the General Managers job as far as training Store Manager Trainees and upon my review I received a 30 cent increase.. What a slap in the face...
bad,"They can treat the employees with a little more respect. Everyone breaks policies and they pick and choose which person they should write up, when everyone is clearly in the wrong."
bad,"if you dont have a family perfect job, my schedule was so messed up not set nor was my paycheck."
bad,nobody follows the handbook and customers are always dissatisfied with the appearance as well as never stocked up to standards. A whole lot of mess. i would not recommend this job to my dog and i dont have one
bad,"This company cares nothing about its employees.  Management has to work for 6 + hours alone because they will not give you the payroll to have another employee work with you.  If you need something to drink during that 6 hours, you can't. You have to wait for another employee to come in so they can check you out.  If you are caught checking yourself out...your gone!! Forget bathroom breaks!! I was told by soooooo many people to run the other way and not work for this company.  The biggest mistake I made was not listening to that advice!!"
bad,"Like many jobs this is only good for the paycheck, at least the one I work at."
bad,"Dollar General  itself is a good company to work for,but District Managers and Store Manager are about themselves and not other employees"
bad,"The company's only focus is money. They do not care about how much they put their employee's through, as long as they are making money. It's very disorganized and impossible to get anything accomplished. This is not a company you want to work for for very long."
bad,They were unfair to me when i was employed there. Management chastised me wrote me up for petty stuff. Pushed me to try and quit by reducing my hours at work. Fired me when i was on medical leave from a doctor.
bad,"not enough hours."
bad,"Typical day consists of picking up your upper managements'  slack. All the responsibility was placed upon 3rd keys. In working there, you learn quickly that your upper management will turn everything around on everyone else, you cant trust anyone, and that is job isn't worth the awful pay. My coworkers were the only thing positive about my experience there. They do not respect work- life balance."
bad,"This company has too many grown up children, and does not give there employees enough hours"
bad,a typical work day would include recovering the store. mangers would sit in break room all day while the cashiers do the work. the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you gave a costumer a great shopping experience.
bad,"I am a store manager for Dollar General and I will say that this has to be the WORST job I have EVER had.  I have no work life balance, my manager has to be one of the most DISRESPECTFUL persons I have ever met. You are expected to complete multiple task in one day ALONE, because you only get enough hours for 2 people in one day.  I get calls from my district manager at all hours of the day and night nonstop. He pulls employees from the store to go to other stores and makes you as a manager work your own store alone. He even makes you work at other managers stores.  STAY AWAY....you can find other places to work."
bad,Don't apply here if you want a life . Poor working conditions . Very unsafe conditions . Oh and don't get hurt ... you will be fired
bad,"I wouldn't recommend that anyone ever either work for much less shop at this company. They are the only organization I've ever been employed where ""I was aspired to FAIL"". You will be hired with the belief of advancement opportunities and you won't. You'll think you will be given time, help and any other opportunity most business offer and you won't. Even if your are hired as a Full time employee....you'll won't even get that. Full time to them is 30 hrs with 50 hrs of work to get done on a weekly bases. If your brought on part-time your expected to be available 24-7 to work one day a week for 4 hrs; if your lucky. I HIGHLY recommend stay clear of this company at any cost."
bad,This company is unable to preform proper communication. Enough said
bad,"Management plays favorites, district manager said there would be an investigation but never went further than that. Store manager told me there would be room for advancement but after subject of investigation came up he fired me for false accusations"
bad,"Interviewed for store manager position before Thanksgiving 2013. Current store was upside down, freight backed up in stockroom and in breakroom. This was a rough store with rough customers that didn't care about leaving a mess. Was told by District Manager that store would be in shape before taking over. Took over the Store at the end of January 2014 and never judge a book by it's cover. This so-called ""Smart team"" was sent into the store to clean it up. What a mess it was left in. Old freight still in receiving dated back to Septemeber 2013, over 40 plastic bins of what was suppose to be certain ""Quad"" merchandise which really was recovery from the sales floor. Sales floor was in good shape until noticing out dated planograms.  So new product was coming in without it's new location. I found many new planograms outside in the huge mess the smart team left. Why are we throwing away new planograms that needed to be set?  Loss prevention didn't care about the amount of merchandise being stolen from external customers...really? This smart team. I heard that this team was sent to many store locations, different districts to so call clean-up stores. I took it upon myself to visit other stores and noticed the same process was occurring at these other stores as it was in my store. What a waste of payroll dollars. After judging this whole Dollar General process, it doesn't make sense. Smart team? Put these hours back into stores and you will see a difference.  High shrink stores also need more hours. Running a high shrink store doesn't mathematically make sense with only 130 hours. Care"
bad,A typical day at work was getting bitched at the minute I got started. The store manager was always looking for something wrong. They pushed you so hard that you would make a mistake and then u would get fired. That's why they cant keep there Assistants and Store Managers
bad,"This was absolutely the worst company and job I ever held in my entire life. Corporate doesn't care about its employees and you are basically a name and a number. They won't back their managers even when a customer steals from them, and physically and verbally abuses you and they do not go by their own company policies. I would never recommend anyone to work for them."
bad,"The work load required and the work hours budgeted for the store's team requires the manager to work much more than the 52 hours a week that is suggested by the company.  "
bad,I was the Staffing and Scheduling Supervisor.  I did not work for this organization long enough for me to give a fair summary.
bad,Was treated very poorly and talked to inappropriately. and didnt recieve pay or benfits i was promised so i quit.
bad,"I put in my 7 months there. I was never told a lot of things like the benefits and when I applied for them I could not get them. Supreme lack of leadership. No chance for advancement unless you were in your 20's and I had over 35 years of retail and customer service experience,with management and a degree. Another thing, money for the till is weighed and never counted and you only got 2 chances for your drawer to be off. I'm sure my drawer was tampered with, since you don't get to coun it at the end of shift, manager does. So one day its short by almost 21 buck, then 20 cents over another, then the cheap company lets you go. Of all the places I have worked, this company by far is the worst. They insulted me several times. I am sorry, I can't move like I could when I was 20, but I was extremely fun and friendly where it counts and thats customer service and not by having customers wait at the register because  your stocking. Its my humble opinion, its a job for fools. I think they want you to put out like your a teen for a twenty dollar an hour effort and only pay you a measley 8.00 an hour. I enjoyed what I missed and that was serving the customer, but even listened to long-time employee's from other stores that came in to help us that the Regional Manager (Pat) needs to pull his head out of his ""you know where""!. So upper level is where its at. The CEO""S of that dump get all the money and the people who do all the work, get nothing."
bad,"When training for this management job I loved it.  Even when I took over my store after seeing how everything was behind in it I still stayed optimistic....that was until my so called Supervisor was never around, couldn't be contacted, promised me the world when I did get in touch with her but she never followed through with anything she'd say.  She was never around when I needed help or a question answered.  She should never have been put into this job is my opinion."
bad,Dollar General allows employees to sexually harass customers and coworkers.  Even after it's reported to HR and the District Manager they allow the harassment to continue until physical violence occurs.  I would not recommend working for this company due to the upper management (district managers) and the lack of caring for their employees.  They do everything possible to make sure employees are available for work but cut their hours up to even an hour before their shift.  I was a manager for this company and the amount of pressure they put on us and the direction we would receive from our superiors led to terrible work conditions and morale was extremely low.
bad,nothing that was said was ever done. no training very unorganized
bad,"Absolutely the worst retailer to work for.No support,no payroll and the work piles up daily.I hope you don't want a work-life balance or respect from this clown company'Be prepared to work your fingers to the bone and be expected to work 10-12 hour days,6 days a week.The benefits are horrible and the pay is just as bad."
bad,Instead of treating employees with respect they treat you like your a criminal . low pay no hours it sucks
bad,"I didn't enjoy this job at all. They expect you to keep a model store and when you get everything organized they will go behind you and move things to the wrong places just so they can have a reason to write someone up. Lots of sticky fingers also in these stores. Employees that have the code to the safe are supposed to be management only, but a lot of cashiers have their hands where they shouldnt be,"
bad,I really did not enjoy this job at all. Management was horrible. Other employees were rude.
bad,"Dollar General pays their employees as little as possible while pushing them as hard as they can and insisting that employees work extra overnight shifts outside of their regular schedules while maintaining their regular schedules with no regard for their personal lives or families. No matter what you do it is never enough. They seem to delight in moving good employees into stores with problems and then riding the employees and telling them what a horrible job they are doing when the stores problems aren't fixed immediately without any concern for the fact that fixing these issues takes time. No matter how much you were praised before, you are suddenly the worst employee in the company because you couldn't instantly solve every problem and bring a store that has fallen apart up to model company standards in a single day. I've seen several very good employees lose their jobs because of this. It's a shame when a company can't recognize their assets in the work force. I honestly can't understand how they stay in business."
bad,"I went from hired as entry level mgr to Asst Manager in three month with no traing, my first nightat work, I was left alone to office work and close the store. I was told if I needed help just call. Second night, same thing. third night; they wanted to train me. I had already trained myself, I had prowled through the office and found deposit slips and looked at others to see how to close out the store and money.   later I had pneumonia, I left work to go get xrays and see the dr (was told not to go back to work) my GM insisted I return and just lay my head on the desk through my shift and do my paperwork..so i worked against Dr's orders for a week.  until I couldn't get up and go.  No communication with GM or DM as far as training.  I was robbed at gunpoint one evening at closing, The company was more worried about did i follow procedure, I was investigated as to  rather I was going to be fired.  The new DM threated our latest GM (who was a great GM) with employees jobs including myself and two others) (if she didnt quit. so she quit to save ours, and we quit with her.  the DM didn't have a reason to fire us so she made false reviews on our store reports, used the excuse for one employee to fire her because she had no vehicle. yet, this girl walked in rain, sleet, and snow, even sick, and never missed her shifts.  she said I didn.t have a dependable vehicle,because one day she was there and I didn't have my car. But, my mom and my daughters cars were broken and we were sharing mine three ways and I never missed a shift during those few days.  Employees were jacked around with"
bad,"The work is fairly easy, however they expect to have only one person working and expect that one person to do all the work (which would normally take at least 2 other people to be done) with no benefits and minimum wage."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone work at a Dollar General ever.  I worked under a 23 year old this was her first store being a store manager.  She never once treated me like a manager once she just treated me like a cashier with a key.  They promised me more hours and more money when I got there they just lied to me I quit a job I was getting 40 hours a week for a job that only gave 28 hours a week I never mad more money.  They will lie to you to get you in there.  There is so much more I can say about this company.  All I can say is I just put this under experienced learned.
bad,expected to work a lot of hours and unload trucks with minimal staff
bad,I was the store manager but was not given hours for other employees so I was made to work 80+ hours per week to get everything done with horrible pay.
bad,Typical day counting the tills and the safe for previous shift as well as your own.. Restocking the store all day long and working frony counter. You are over worked and very unpaid. Not a safe place to work especailly if you work overnight there are just two people in the whole store very unsafe.
bad,I will never work for Dollar General companies again. It was an awful work environment where the managers did not care if you were sick (contagious) they still wanted you to come in to work and get everyone else sick.
bad,"My typical day would be helping customers, which I absolutely loved. I did not really learn anything new considering I had worked in the same kind of environment basically throughout my whole life since I was 16. Management was really rude to the their coworkers. The coworkers were nice and were always helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers but you always have to ""kill them with kindness"". The most enjoyable part of the job was, like I said, helping people."
bad,"Because of this job I don't think I will ever work in retail again. It is very stressful and the hours are inconsistent. They make promises on job responsibility, job security, and hours but they tend not to honor their promises. A typical day consists of being given a long list of tasks that exceed the amount of time allotted to complete said tasks. Unfortunately, the co-workers relationships are more of an your own your own, everyone looks out for themselves type. It would be nice if it were more of a cohesive work environment where everyone worked together to make sure that everything ran smoothly. The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with a large variety of people, this is not only enjoyable but educational."
bad,"my typical day at dollar general was stocking, assisting customer's and cleaning up the store. My co-workers were alright but some could used more people skills."
bad,"I worked at 4 *different* stores for 3 full years and was treated the same way at each one! They promise raises and promotions that never happen, they put your overtime that you work on your NEXT check so you don't ever get paid time and a half for overtime, they change your clock ins and clock outs to screw you out of money for the hours you worked, AND they won't work with you whatsoever if you need time off, your kids get sick, etc. If you're not there when you're scheduled to be there, you're fired, doesn't matter what the reason is. My 8 month old son was hospitalized for 5 days and I didn't get a *single* day off to stay with him, and I couldn't risk losing my assistant manager job because I'm a single mom with 2 kids (2 and 1) with no financial help whatsoever. In short, Dollar General Corp. is made up of lying, cold hearted people and I wouldn't recommend ANYONE to work there, at ANY store."
bad,Handling customers and cleaning the environment. Ensuring the customers have everything they need.
bad,"Check out customers and provide customer service, the pay is really low, and management does an awful job, one person works while the others sit around"
bad,"The company does not care about its associates at all!!!"
bad,"only one working register all day, at the same time looking out for shop lifters, cleaning the store, stocking, and helping customers. I learned how to read the labs on the boxes, that come from shipping, how to handle cash better."
bad,"A typical day of work I clock in work on my register, ring customers out and bag their merchandise. I'm always very nice to the customers and try to help them to the best of my ability. My coworkers and management are all scared of losing their jobs. I feel like everyday I work there, I am constantly threatened to be fired, and nothing I do is ever good enough. The hardest part of the job, I feel is trying to work up to everyone else's standards. The most enjoyable part of the day in all honesty is when I get to go home at the end of the day."
bad,I have never worked for a company so rude to the employees than this company. I have been required to go to other stores and spend my gas to get there.
bad,"This company is poorly ran and maintained.  The store manager is required to work 45 hours a week in six days.  More times a typical work week is upwards of 60-70. There is never enough management coverage for the store manager to leave to take a break. Their is no initial training and on going training does not exist.  The chance of promotion is not based on how well you run a store, but simply if the RM likes you or not."
bad,I was worked like a horse even when I was very ill. Most of the time I would open up and work till I closed the store. What really pushed me is that my manager was docking my pay and hours behind my back because he was only allowed to have a few people work so many hours a week so I was basically working for free.
bad,i went to dollar general to work with one of my old dms. a typical day consist of being in the store at 5am and by myself to 10 or 11 am trying to take care of customers when we open and stock the shelves and all the other manager duties we have
bad,"hated working there, retail is not for me, very sneaky and backstabing managers there"
bad,I had to work many days before i got a day off. Corporate believes employees are the number one shoplifters
bad,"it was a ok job i always had something to do like unload trucks,"
bad,I lost my job because I upset my boss by call corporate. I was promoted and my raise was not put in by the district manager.
bad,"A typical day is working 10-12 hours and getting a salary of $35,000 a year. Typical work week hours 60-70+ This company has no morals!!! Please do yourself a favor and stay away!!!"
bad,"A typical day as a manager of a Dollar General starts very early, you have to work 5 1/2 days, some of them open to close. I was lucky my store had to close at 7pm. The one thing that sticks out is how much upper management let us store managers know that we are thieves. In training, manager theft, in the quarterly meeting, manager theft, and when they came to install cameras in our location, they were pointed at the money handling areas, not the corner of the store that was almost impossible to keep an eye on. I hope that they have been able to change that culture."
bad,This place doesnt care about their employees. They dont give managers enough hours for the tens of thousands of things that need to get done in a reasonable time. its ridiculous
bad,Very unprofessional. Cut hours without informing any workers they where doing so. Unfair and favorite treatment.
bad,"I basally put up the truck, clean, stock the items, handle cash/ credit cards/checks"
bad,The theft was horrible at the store I worked at. Management was pretty clear on the fact that if you wanted a family or had a family that  you would never advance past your store in the company.
bad,"A typical day at worked consisted of standing at the front register, ringing people up and fixing up items in front. The only thing I learned was how to use the register and a box cutter. The management at this store was horrible. Assistant manager verbally ridiculed me, and made fun of my motor skill disability to the point that others were encouraged to join in. The hardest part of the job was doing essentially everything. If I was on the floor, I would take the responsibility of the person working register, if I was working register I was expected to take items back to the shelves while still being on register. If I had to take a bathroom break, they would make the customers wait for me and wouldn't take care of them in my absence. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,the hardest part of this job was the ever changing staff and lack of support by upper management
bad,Employees are rude and controlling. The managers gave whatever hours they didnt want and gave you a hard time when you needed time off
bad,Very busy environment with no room for advancement in the work place. Management is not fair and unwilling to work with their employees.
bad,It started off ok but management changed and now very little hours... We already had limited hours to work but more people were hired with everybody getting only one day to work. Management takes majority of the hours the store is always a mess.
bad,They claim to put their customers first when in fact they will scheduled single coverage for 2-3 hours at a time. They don't allow enough in their budgets for 2 cashiers at all times and this can be a safety issue. They expect customers to stand in line for 15 minutes to get one item. They also heap inner amounts of freight on their workers and they want but cup in 48 hours. Store managers get one day off a eek. And get no holiday pay but are expected to work every holiday. They are also threatened by the company and their distract managers that if sales don't increase weekly and if certain amounts of money are not raises for their literacy there will be repercussions. You can't force people to shop and buy more than they have money to do so.
bad,i didnt learn much at all and having no brake when you are working 8hurs
bad,"Worked like a dog, barely got paid, company never satisfied, poor neighborhood, unethical district manager, poor community involvement"
bad,The company just did not communicate.  I did though change the system in my store and was able to build a great team.  I pushed for greatness out of each one and tried to make there employment fulfilling.  I helped with there work/life balance in accordance to SOPS sometimes at the cost of my own work/life balance.  I developed a great team and although the main company was very unorganized our store was well stocked and showed great increases in profit and sells which made us grow our customer base for 3 years in a roll.  I went to work with this company and ended up helping a community by starting programs and giving them a nice place to shop.  in fact we were sent to other stores to help fix them.  my associates got involved in community events and we just made the best of it
bad,"I learned how to work with difficult customers, how to rearrange a store gondolas."
bad,casher stock if needed mopped as needed the boss did not like me so she would make me work nights knowing i had no babysitter at the time
bad,"Management was sorely lacking in all respects. The time management of management was poor, respect was non-exhistant, pay was very low and employee moral was as you would expect, not there."
bad,"Very hostile work environment. Under-handed business practices in regards to employee benefits, wages and break times. I endured repeated assaults both physical and verbal from customers for upholding company policy. Was also repeatedly mistreated and threatened by other employees and assistant management."
bad,Thankless management from top to bottom. They are always taking away hours but expect the store to look better. This meant 80-90 hour work weeks this added up to less than minimum wage because I was on salary. In January as a store manager don't expect a day off. The end of the fiscal year is means about 40-60 hours less in payroll to give your employees but you still must meet standards. There is never any recognition for a job well done just thats fine but you still need to work on this this and this. Unless this is a job to make ends meet for now fine. If you try to make it a career you will probably work yourself to death before you meet your goal.
bad,I enjoy working here but i really want me a full time job. My co-workers are very helpful and i enjoy working with them.There is nothing really hard about working for this company. The most enjoyable part of the job is me working.
bad,It was horrid! The store was understaffed and extremely dirty. The general manager had an attitude with everyone including the customers and hired her friends from outside of work. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with that but when you allow them to trade shifts with out the other persons knowledge or consent and fire them for not showing up it's ridiculous. 
bad,"Horrible pay"
bad,"Co-workers are fun to be around"
bad,"Wanted less hours a day....manager said she couldn't do that, have to work 6-8 hour days. My feet can't do long hours like that so when she said she wouldn't work with me, I quit.....now she is badmouthing me to other employees there."
bad,"You barely get paid minimum wage, the bosses don't do anything, first of the month is a complete and utter nightmare.  You have to pay for your uniforms, badges, box cutters, parking and lockers."
bad,"Poor Management, Drama, Not a good place to work. Customers were the best part of my day. Schedule changed everyday."
bad,I do love my job there. But i am ready for a change if there are no Dollar General in Elkco Nv. I would take the closet thing to it.
bad,the managers leave all of the work for you to do while they kick their feet up and relax. then they are completely unappreicative and their personal drama takes over. horrible place to work!!
bad,Alot of work but you get to know your customers. very productive and its never a dull moment working there.  
bad,doller general works you hard with little pay and short hours not a very good place to work if you have a family
bad,Job only provided part-time hours but handed out full-time work. Management was extremely unprofessional. The store was very cluttered and unorganized. There was no team work.
bad,A typical day for me was traveling and doing in store training of new employees and training of in store promoting. I participated in store set ups and job fairs. 
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed working there were the costumers .I worked the register stock and cleaned the working area.That they dont care who you are, for the company a worker is jhust a number.Stinks some them were just fine, when I worked until closing timewhen I was done working."
bad,I was hired at a new store as Leas Sales Associate part time. Which I'd the same as a keyholder. The store manager refuses to accept that and tells me I am a cashier only and will not give me keys or responsibility. I am treated like dirt and in the system itvtells me I am a LSA. Will probably be sueing this company.
bad,"As A General Manager You Are Just Really Slaved All Day.The Pay Is Terrible And There Is A Dollar General On Every Corner In Every City Across America. This Company Is All About The Higher Up's. If You Work Foe Corporate Then You Get Great Money. If You Run A Store You Will Starve To Death, Let Alone Your Staff.. Dollar General Should Be ASHAMED Of Themselves. No One Can Live Off Of Those Wages..Plantation Owners Paid More Than Dollar General."
bad,Terrible moved from store to store helping company terrible turnover even to different city treat you like cattle use you then slaughter you.
bad,"Although simple this job is no ideal. The management is not typically pleasant. The computer system is ancient, and a cashier has almost no abilities. Can not even void an item without a manager key. The only thing I like about this job is the fact that I have a job."
bad,Working at DG employees were not valued as individuals but as someone to get the freight out. There was not a shred of honesty in any thing that was said. It was not a fun and inspiring place to work.
bad,There was no management so we always had a bunch of managers from all over the place trying to run the store and the staff was always talking negatively about other staff members. I only stayed for a month because the scheduling wasn't well done and the store was never run properly. It shouldn't take multiple months for a company to hire a store manager.
bad,stocked shelves helped customers find what they needed made sure that the store looked clean co workers were fun to work with lot of joking around
bad,"Working at Dollar General was fun at first, but when the company cut oour hours it wasnt fun anymore"
bad,"I supervised sales workers in a retail establishment. My duties included, customer service, maintaining the registers and the store petty cash, making sure the cashier stayed on her task at hand, stocking, making deposits, receiving vendors, office paperwork, etc..."
bad, Manage store’s payroll budget
bad,"Worst job ever! The company strives to keep you poor by not allowing the hours to run a decent business, and not paying you a decent rate for the position you are in. There were 2 employees under me that were making more hourly than I was. A typical day for me was to come in and finish what my Assistant/Store manager didn't accomplish in the day. It usually included putting merchandise up from the truck, planograms, ad sets, inventory counts,price changes, and checking in vendors. My Store manager was awful not one thank you for a job well done, all she did was complain about what wasn't getting accomplished when my Assistant was there. She never had the schedule posted before 5 pm the day before the new work week started and always scheduled me close than back in the next day to open shifts. The only enjoyable part of this job was my regular customers."
bad,"Wow, I have got to say I should have never taken this job. I come from Big Box Retail and worked for some great companies. First day on the job I had to do some computer training which was taking tests. I was told by my Boss that I was the only Manager Trainee doing online learning. As no one really has in our district. 2nd day I was on register for about 90% of my shift. It was just me and the Store Manager in the store all day. For one I can't work like this at all. I have been a Retail Manager with few other companies where I had 20 to 40 associates working for me. I never had to be a cashier as I know how to work it I am not paid to be a cashier but paid to manage a store!!! Another thing is u get about $13 Bucks to start as Trainee and when u get ur own store u get only $15 bucks maybe $16 if your lucky. That's poor!!! I was making 50K.... I rather quit and keep looking for a better job in retail management then this company. Don't take this job because they have a high turnover rate with Store Managers. Even the Trainee's can't take it and quit a month in the training. Most Managers only make it to a year as all the stores are high shrink and poor. If the District Manager wants to put new blood into his district he can fire u at will. ""They fire about 5 Store Managers a day"" with their 10,000 stores nationwide they can do that and will. That's a fact look it up!!!!"
bad,I ran the register and I liked most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the five o'clock rush when everybody rushed in. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,Poor overall experience as a store manager.
bad,"My employees at my store were great to work with, some of my customer were very nice while the other ones would steal you blind. The normal customers that would come in and talk to you two three times a day and not buy anything, are the ones that you have to watch out for."
bad,"Typical work day was clock in and count your teal, then go clean and straighten up the shelves, put things back where they belong, and work the register. Management was not good at all, she didn't help me when I needed it the most. The hardest part of the job was being in the back putting things on the shelves and a customer is ready to check out and you wouldn't even know it because there was no bell to ring or nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week."
bad,"Wow, I have got to say I should have never taken this job. I come from Big Box Retail and worked for some of the best. First day on the job I had to do some computer training which was taking tests. I was told that I'm prolly the only one doing this. As no one really has in our district. 2nd day I was on register for about 80% of my shift. It was just me and the Store Manager in the store all day. For one I can't work like this at all.

If the District Manager wants to put new blood into his district he/she can fire u at will. ""They fire about 10 Store Managers a day"" with their 10,000 stores nationwide they can do that and will."
bad,"Lowest pay for management i have ever seen, constant threat of job loss for impossible standards, constant stocking of stores in unsafe manners, low pay for high standards, VERY high turnover rate of workers"
bad,"enjoyed working there, meeting new people, learned new things, wasn't pleased with management. i worked hard, and was over looked. no kind of communication between manager about work. need new management."
bad,"Typical day at work you would be a cashier, unloading trucks, stocking, sales, banking. The co-workers was pretty decent there."
bad,Very diverse cultural atmosphere. Fast pace environment.
bad,"I have never been so insulted by a company in my whole life! They did not respect my decision to stay in college to try to better myself, and tried to repremand me for it. No respect for the individual at all!"
bad,"This was the hardest job I ever work, did not like runinng a large store by myself, had to work 4 to 5 hours along.Only one day off, sometimes had to work from opening to close, 6am to 9:30 pm; Sometimes didnt have a manager to work so I had to stay. I work in a bad area, theft was so high. People was really afraid to work there. I learn how to work hard. I learn to pray for protection.I was the first manger that had good inventory. Management was ?????? Co-worker cashier/stocker was good. They help as much as possible."
bad,"The store is divided. When i got the job i was externing with Richwood Police Department and they needed help, so i field out the application online. Since I've been there, we have been thru three managers in the coarse of two months. I barley work now but the manager feel like if she like you, she will give you hours."
bad,was only there for three months they had a bad inventory came in and fired the whole crew
bad,"Low paid and low hrs, hard work,u stock the shelf and cashier and mop the floor ,and then put up with people that conplain ,they dont give the people that work thier no incentive to want to come to work.Than it just a job."
bad,"will promise 30 hrs or more a week, burt after a week or two they cut you to 9 hrs, also went thru 4 managers in a 3 mth period"
bad,i really enjoy what i do. I lke the people i work with and customers i see everyday
bad,"i loved this job, it just got boreing sometimes and i had to work inside everyday, but i really did love it, i just through big boxes full of different stuff onto a convoyar belt for about 14 hours everyday for 6days a week, met some really great people and became friends."
bad,This job sucks. You have no home life and management is horrible to you. Never enough hours and help.
bad,Worst company to work for ever!!! Walk away! Upper management was un ethical on every level
bad,"the management team were not friendly at all , always had a favorite and I thought you didn't favor in management ."
bad,Work demands exceeded natural expectations and the compensation for such work did not meet the work performed.
bad,I loved working there just because of the customers and a few of the employee's. When a new store manager came in is when everything just started not being right. I brought it to corperates attention but they just let me go because I did what I thought was right to do.
bad,"Brutal company with unreasonable expectations. Corporate informs DM""s on Wednesday to cut payroll Thursday-Friday... poor planning with upper management having no thought to what the cuts do to store personnel moral or quality of life. Obviously, when payroll is cut exempt managers pick up the hours."
bad,The company simple does not allow a store enough hours to run smoothly. Dollar General loves to pinch pennies and good workers end up leaving due to a lack of importance and trust they are shown.
bad,Company has changed over the years. A typical day is 10 to 14 hours five days a week. Managnent is detached and not responsive.
bad,"Does not work with you if you have anything medical. I was threatened to be slapped, treated poorly by management, and their solution was to transfer me."
bad,This job is the worst I have ever had. the traing there stinks. I wish I had never worked there.
bad,"The Bosses hear are not that friendly and they want you to doo more than ur share, with out the pay"
bad,This is a company that I will never work for again. Lack of management from corporate on down.
bad,"I worked for Dollar General Market in Ardmore Tennessee for almost 5 years. I was the one they always called when someone didnt show up for their shift or called out, and was also the one expected to stay till 12:30 and 1 in the morning if things needed to be done. The manager there is VERY rude and only cares about how to cover himself. If something goes wrong he goes to extreme limits to cover up what happened who done it. I was terminated for things I could not even control and ridiculous reasons that he gave me. Oh, and if you plan on buying meat, or produce there, be sure to check the dates and make sure they are not spoilt! I would not recommend shopping at Dollar General in Ardmore Tennessee at all!!! However, it was not all bad. I made some amazing people and had an amazing support group for the people I became close to and a manager that I became close with. There are people there who care about you and your needs and the fairness of the company. I felt it was unfair for the hiring manager to cover up the wrong doings of his favorite employees but punish those that actually do their job."
bad,Very poorly managed work environment. Rude management. You're required to do a lot more than you should be doing. You do the managers job 90% of the time while having derogatory slurs thrown at you. This job would be enjoyable under different management.
bad,I didnt like working at this place because they play favorites to certain employees.
bad,"I am a current store manager who has won countless awards with the company. I run my store or try to on 2 people a shift.1 manager 1 cashier. On average 152 hours per week. My store is the 3rd highest volume sales store in the district out of 14. My District manager has no idea what is going on, And will call me or other managers to explain or train him. Very low pay for the work you have to do. People are treated bad. Corp. one hand has no idea what the othe hand is doing. Yeah they promote form within but it takes them months to get your pay changed and back pay you, if your lucky and you get back payed. Work a store on 152 hours try and get an over 1000 piece truck out with 6 people on staff and do management duites and seasonal sets ad everything else that needs done... WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!! No Upper management having your back. They will throw you under the bus at anytime...You get paid for 40 hours as a manager and work from 50 to 80 hours a week.. (THIS IS ON YOUR PAY CHECK STUB) that you get paid for 40 hours..All employees are looked at as theives.. They believe 70% is internal..."
bad,"terrible management, employees, pay rate, and lack of customer service."
bad,the pay is minimum wages which is horrible everyone is part time except for management. the stores are dirty. the hardest part of the job is clearing the stockroom in one day then they start cutting hours
bad,"This was my first job and I can't believe how hard I had to fight to get hired at this location. I had applied at least 10 times to that location with no call and eventually I contacted the District Manager to see what I needed to do to get hired because that was my first job and I needed experience. He actually hired me to work at the location I really wanted to work at because I had the ""go-getter attitude and the foresight to call and demand a job."" I guess getting the job through the DM instead of the manager is what started this off on such a bad note."
bad,worst place to ever work. treated like garbage called names and no respect
bad,"Dollar General is a good PT job for someone who wants to make a little extra cash, they don't pay well. As for management, don't be one of them. If you have a problem employee they will not support you in getting rid of them."
bad,Thanks anyway. I would not recommend anyone to work here in an management position.
bad,"dollar general sucks. I worked throughout my pregnancy. I still had to mop, sweep, stock the produce and get 10 pound bags of ice. I was a cashier. I did what I had to do because I have responsibilities."
bad,I generally managed 1-2 employees at a time. When the store manager was absent I would handle scheduling. I ran the register and did night deposits when I opened and handled morning paperwork when i opened. Management was constantly changing along with employees due to lack of pay for a considerably heavy workload. The hardest part of the job was long night hours being a single parent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I supervised. They actually liked working for me.
bad,job wanted people to be available 24 hrs a day 7 days a week as a minimum wage worker and still only wanted to give you 14-20 hrs a week but you better be available if they call you to come in without notice. poor management and idiots working at corporate
bad,"I would usually arrive at the store around 6am and unload the deliveries from the truck. I would resume opening the store at 8am while getting the paperwork started for the day. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of my job would have to be organizing the stock, running registers, greet customers and keep watch over the store simultaneously. Multi-tasking I love and can handle, but can become overwhelming at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the customers always leave out pleased and happy."
bad,Your day is non stop. In management you can work 16 hours a day. They still don't give 2 hoots about you. I learned in management believe no one. Co workers are not very dependable. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a new dm who was trying to climb the corporate ladder. He once told me he was not there to support me. He would let you get help and train them and then he would take them away. He would let your help transfer to another location without letting you know. The most fun thing was keeping all the stock out.
bad,"terrible management, management needs to go back to school"
bad,This company has a huge turnover rate not a good place to work.
bad,Always had a good work day. I learn so many thing. The biggest part of my job is truck day. But if you put a little fun in it. you will get in stocked in know time.
bad,It was a okay job when you work at dollar general. It is not one of them job that help you better your self.
bad,"I was a manager/stock man /cashier 99% of the time/merchandiser/ad setter/shipping and receiving clerk/janitor/pick up trash and pull weeds in the parking lot/watch contractors clean floors after hours til early a.m./all the other titles and jobs they expected. D G was sued and lost in federal court due to miss classification of managers. They tell you up front you shouldn't work more than 55 hours a week is not true. I put in over 100 hours a week on salary, which by the way is illegal. That was one thing D G had to pay managers, was OT for hours over 40. I recommend anyone halfway considering going to work there to do the homework and get a contract. They cut payrolls and have managers run a whole store alone with no company support. Please don't even shop there. Go to wmart and get greeted by greeters that are happy and a store that has everything one needs at a great price. D G has only grown due to not paying their employees for all the hours they work and having usually only a few employees to operate a store. Horrible way to treat employees and they go through employees quick to get federal money for each person they hire. It was once a family owned business and maybe was good in the past, but drive past them new stores and go to wmart."
bad,The job was fine was promised things prior to job that was not followed through on
bad,"worst job i ever had...i would advise no one to work here...the mgt team is rude,nasty and very disrespectful..."
bad,"horrible management, horrible scheduling its just not a good place work!!!"
bad,Lack of respect or empathy. Turnover is consistent. Full time promised but never given full time hours. No benefits to brag about. Some managers sit around and watch you sweat. No raises or advancements available. Messy stores. No break rooms to brag about. Lack of support from regional manager at that time.
bad,"This company is horrible because the work is extreme, long hours and low pay. Management is horrible and does not care about the employees."
bad,Manager work from open to close hard to move up with the company
bad,"Typical long day at work, except you are following around theives all day and this does! not allow time to get your work completed."
bad,"more work than pay, expect working all the time with no breaks"
bad,"You will be promised everything, and you will be expected to out perform everyone. But you will not be rewarded for your efforts. Those at the top reap all the rewards. They hate the unions and OSHA because of the changes they would make."
bad,over all the company is great the customer are friendly and the employeeshave a great time when they work its just that the manager of the store is very unprofessional
bad,"you dont get compensated for your vacation time, work more weekends than not"
bad,The company doesn't treat it's eployees well. I pay leaves alot to be desired.
bad,Has little or no concern for people. Employees are treated like merchandise with the only benefits provided are those required by law.
bad,"This company believes in slaves, the Store Manager works 70-80 hours a week. Many weeks without a day off. The tasks set by corporate are unachieveable, no payroll hours in the stores. The store manager is pretty much the stockperson, cashier, pretty much everything. The pay is not enough for the Store Manager, you make less than the Assistant Manager when you figure out your hourly wage. Bonuses, they say there is them, rarely does any store get them. Raises, on average one hundred dollars a year. Health benefits average. No home life, many have divorced their spouses leave them, because you are never home. Hardly, does anyone get promoted from within, they hire District Managers from outside the company. The promise you the world when interviewed, deliver on nothing. The turnover on Presidents and Vice Presidents a revolving door same with DM's. Turnover on Store Managers and store personnel is huge. You will walk around like a walking zombie and tired all the time. When a cashier, Assistant Manager or Lead Clerk calls off you are stuck to cover the shift. Never make plans, because something always happens and you have to be at work. you can never keep up in your store, they bombard you with everything at one time. Good luck in keeping your stockroom cleaned out, you spend a week cleaning it out, and the next truck it is FULL AGAIN!"
bad,One of the worst places anyone could ever work. A
bad,The worst mistake I made in my life working for dollar general. The dm for district 156 is horrible. If you are not a formal walmart employee or his church member you can hang it up.
bad,"No hours, No Benefits, Lack of care for the hard working person, I've seen people get fired over nothing, if the district manager doesn't like you your gone, the district manager cut everyones hours to nothing. Good teams are hard to find but Dollar General didn't care. Tries to tell you what to do off the clock. Wants you to run earrands on your gas. To many lies from management and district manager."
bad,The dollar general wasnt very pleasant to work for. Not only was the manager rude and very inappropriate the employees werent so customer friendly.
bad,I love working with customers they need to choose better management. Not enough hours for the distance of your drive.
bad,"i helped build the store for grand opening, including building the shelves, end caps, unloaded trucks, inventory"
bad,This is a horrible place to work. As manager you are severely limited on payroll and hours for employees. Ended up working allot of hours solo. Do not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,They want you to be security and do your work all while getting paid nothing. This job was a joke expected me to work 7 days for 35 hours. I quit the 1st week.
bad,"It's not about how well you are doing. It's more about who's butt your willing to kiss. It's all about who you know if you want to get hired on,and it doesn't matter if nobody shows up to close with you, because if you make a $10 mistake then they automatically assume you took it. Being assistant manager is the worse position because that's where the blame falls."
bad,During my 1 year here we went through 3 district managers and 2 regional managers I quit after the last district manager who never supported me always made me feel like I was going to loose my job any day and he would go behind my back daily with my assistants he also had a bad temper. I would not recommend this company
bad,"They expected you to work yourself to death, giving you next to no payroll hours to maintain adequate staffing. I was working 80+ hours a week and ended up in the hospital 3 separate times due to exhaustion related issues. When I told my DM about needing better work/life balance, she advised me to work somewhere else then."
bad,"Working at Dollar general was a miserable experience. As a key holder,  I made only $8.50.I witnessed a lot of transphobic actions in the job. Not my last manager, but the one before.  He took up for a customer who misgendered me and  was rude. When I was let go the manager didn't even show up to fully explain why. The a few of the freezers went down and as far I know they weren't fixed last time I was in there around early December. I was constantly stressed, worked whenever asked, and very much underappreciated  They operate under a skeleton crew and it's not viable, especially in locations like the Lexington road store that are always busy."
bad,"Working here was like experiencing my first job at 17 when I worked for Family Dollar. It's awful, at least my experience was and the location I was at was horrible. Constant thievery, inconsistent hours, unsupportive managers, favoritism galore, overwhelming tasks that felt impossible to do with the large influx of customers we had since our particular store was in the middle of nowhere and the only store available to people with well below average income. The people who did the most work were the cashiers (which I was one at the time). The only thing that the cashiers didn't have to do was make the schedules or count down their drawers. Also the amount of gossip or people using the smallest bit of information about you to start rivalries or problems was disgusting. I think the particular location I was at needs to be completely torn down and remodeled from the ground up and that includes the managers and employees. I will never work for such a company ever again."
bad,Creativity is not desired nor tolerated. Your schedule changes and sometimes they notify you of the change. Physically demanding and you have to close the store and turn around and come back in at 5 am to work the truck. I hold an advanced degree and needed something temporary after recovering from a hospitalization. This was NOT for me and the pay is awful. Consider yourself warned.
bad,"Things were great at first, I was offered the job with no issues, and my hours of availability were even able to be taken care of with no issues. Unfortunately the manager that started alongside me got injured at their second job, and was forced to resign because they couldn't work. The manager that has come in to fill the spot temporarily doesn't seem to want to be there, and for whatever reason I'm getting the short end of the stick. They don't care about any of my concerns, and are no longer respecting my hours of availability and want me working well into the night, making my life miserable because now I can't do any of the after-work activities I enjoy."
bad,Loved working with the customers and the other staff. There is alot of physical labor involved multi-tasking heavy lifting. Not paid very well and extreme turnover.
bad,This company is all about profits. They care only about the money. Low paying and not too much flexabilty in wage movement. Not A LOT of hours to fill in to do your job.
bad,"Not enough employees. Sometimes 2 people running the whole store. Ast. managers only making 9.00 an hour and sometimes they make u work 5am to 11pm. At least I did numerous times.      And I got no appreciation for anything. I tried calling in sick once they gave me a no call no show and scheduled  me wrong a month later so I'd get fired for doing it twice after working ther4years"
bad,"Besides that, it's Hades. I LOVE hard work, love to stay busy but this was ridiculous. Busy all the time..Slow cashiers, meanwhile, you have a store to recover, vendors to check in....then there's being called to the register every two seconds. The pay su ks and corporate DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. Dollar General is owned by shareholders...you do the math. Put it this way..my BP was sky high and I lost thirty l s in 3 months. I am 50 yrs old. "
bad,"My store manager never listened to his employees, and whenever something went wrong he blame the workers instead of taking accountability for it himself"
bad,"With nonstop movement and ""not enough hours"" to properly run a store, it is not a fun place to work. I went through 3 store managers in my time there, and the second one I had was the best manager I've ever seen! For obvious reasons she was moved to better stores. It is very easy to get into a management position because the turnover rate is ridiculously high. They only allow 2 people to a shift, yet expect you to do the work of 4-5 people and pay you as little as possible for it."
bad,"They have a flexible schedule, but if you ask for time off when it isn't convenient to them, they punish you by giving one day a week about five hours. So you basically make about $30 in a full check."
bad,"Worked here for a few months. It was my first job and I gave it my all, but despite that, several newer employees (their first job as well) were given raises and/or management positions (within a month or so) before myself. Despite being there longest, I was the last one to get a raisr but at that point, I was so frustrated and felt like I was being punished, so I resigned and went to a job that paid me more ($9.25) than minimum wage."
bad,You can NOT promise support and never show up then want to fuss cause things weren't done. Excpectations are way to high when not enough hrs are given to the store to move the business and upper management does not stay true to their word
bad,"The worst place to work at manager is mean and has favorites store is a mess she never answers phone bever makes a schedule . the worst place to work at."
bad,"worse job i've ever had. the managers and supervisors truly only care about numbers they do not care about your family your life or your health. after messing my back up due to a car accident i came back to work seeking to be on light duty per doctors orders they said no u either order select or go back home which i had no more pto and i would be getting docked per day because they don't excuse any doctors excuses. i called corporate and i also talked to the director and they did not work with me.i will never work for this place ever again, i don't even shop at the stores any more."
bad,The company doesn’t care for its employees or their families. They don’t really care about safety every store in my district was getting robbed at gun point one person lost their life and they refused to get security. They don’t work with your schedule. The goals they set are unrealistic and unachievable with the time they give you or the help you receive. If you are an ASM with no store manager good luck hiring people.  You ha w to fight for raises. Benefits are not that great and they do not have good copay or deductibles.
bad,DG does not and will not pay enough....it's a job to say you had a job to make you feel like you was contributing somehow....it's a feeling and not true...DG has high turn over due to low pay and low hours....a cashier only gets 20-22 hours per week.at $176 GROSS a week on average...how can you do anything with that amount?? even at 40hrs per week at $8 per hr thats $320 bring home....better but how does DG expect to keep people at that low rate of pay....I liked the work loved my coworkers but I had to go to make more money.....until DG pays more they can't expect more....they know this
bad,Very little pay zero respect. The district managers will litterally tell you you're replaceable... Managers take harrassment complaints in one ear out the other. You truly mean nothing to this company
bad,Dollar General is not the company I would suggest anyone to work with. They do NOT care about their employees and they are only about the dollar. You do so much work for little to nothing pay and they still come in and criticize like you not doing your job .
bad,"Poor hours, not worth the gas to even come to work. I dreaded going in every day, but did it to support my family. The job overall is easy, its mentally and physically exhausting. Not a very friendly management team at all"
bad,Had and bad boss was rough to me and most of the people that came in the store the reason I left I really love working for the company just could not get along with my boss  she was so disrepestab to everyone when I would ask for help she would be ungly to me in front of everyone in the store
bad,"I was a Key holder/support manager and recieved minimum wage.  No benefits unless you paid for them. No overtime. Overall poor, poor management. Lots of favoritism."
bad,"It was ok if you can adapt to the schedule provided, however the pay is extra low."
bad,"You get paid minimum wage for loads and loads of work. There's only 2 people allowed each shift usually the manager sits in the office the entire time. Youre expected to run the register, stock, and clean. Your have a set amount of totes you HAVE to finish before your shift up."
bad,Worst job I have ever had in my Management experience.  They constantly have management working alone in the store because they are cheap and won't pay for a second person to help out.
bad,"Terrible job, poor management, poor hours, assistant managers were not even trained. Manager was very lazy and others had to at times do his job for him. VERY rude assistant manager at the time."
bad,Not a very good place to work. The management sucks. They treated me like i was 5. Tried taking my phone. The managaer (tracey) is not the kind of woman to work for. She tried taking my phone so i quit
bad,The worse job ever make sure y’all work where the people are ignorant and y’all have some kind of security. They steal and ask you why you didn’t stop them even though they tell you in the beginning don’t try and stop them from stealing just call them
bad,The place was mess and unprofessional the managers were not dependable and the coworkers were rude. There was no room for improvement in position. I wasn't happy there.
bad,"Corporate is unfair and unrealistic for the hours they give you, and expect customer service with no employees lol  I could say so so much more but i will leave it at that. this company was a joke to work for..."
bad,"Corporates procedure need to change in regards to  Security and Safety of employees. System or sales items not always working leaving customers to get combative. Staffing limits leave people even management alone in a store is not the best policy in any public working environment.  "
bad,Store manager is an idiot.. I lasted 4 weeks. I was hired as the lead as full time. Then I was demoted to part time and 11 hours per week.  The store is a literal mess..
bad,"A Company that downgrades your resume when you look for another job after they work you to death for pennies."
bad,They work the store managers to death then just swap you out for a new store manager once you're burnt out and just ready to die. Be ready to work 6-7 days a week and 60+ hours because they're too cheap to give you any payroll. Many managers have to use they're own vacation just to pay for the employees to come in. District managers are swapped pretty regularly.
bad,If your not a fast worker or like long hours 6 days a week don’t work here. Management sucks hours suck...............................................
bad,DM wont allow us store managers to terminate bad employees. Instead they prefer to sweep employee theft under the rug. We cant schedule sufficient coverage and often leave one employee in the store while the other is at lunch or they simple just don't show up. Working 5am-9pm is grueling! DO NOT WORK FOR DG!
bad,"Non Competitive pay, terrible work environment, terrible upper management attitudes, store technology is inferior, refused to work with scheduling, highly resistant on vacation time and unwilling to work with needs of a family."
bad,No home work life balance. Training was a non factor even in the manager training program. They just gave someone the position that been there a while but no training skills. Thru me in way earlier than should have so a store manager was in place! Should have left then.
bad,Honestly I would give zero Stars if that was an option. Management runs around acting like they are working in reality they aren't doing anything but sitting on their thumbs. Cashier literally runs around the store to do everything and there's certain things you can't do on the register because it requires a key you have to run around to find a manager underpaid for all the work I do
bad,"Not a good place to work they treat the employees like they are not nothing and they work the dog out of you for that 7.25 hour, they care nothing about you they just want there store open and closed on time as far as security the DM's don't care either just want there money and training they don't train you just stick you in the store and put you to work"
bad,I got this job because it's one of the only places to work here in my town. So it was convenient. What I wasn't expecting was working with people that scream at the customers making them cry. I've had to appologize to customers for other employees. Ive witnessed one of the key holders yelling at customers and she's been reported and they aren't doing anything about it.
bad,"Corporate office is clueless as to what it actually takes to make a store run. This has the trickle down effect all the way down the line to store managers."
bad,"The demands on the store manager are unrealistic. Dollar General's business model is based on the store manager living in the store in order to get the job done. There is minimal payroll and quite often there is only one person in the store for half the day or more, that person is expected to take care of customers, check in vendors, work truck etc. Dollar General claims to have a culture of serving others when in fact Dollar General has a culture of serving the almighty dollar."
bad,"Managers steal, lie, cheat, and the district and regional managers look the other way. also the manager sleeps with the young cashiers and management look the other way, the manager curses and uses the mf word every three words and nothing is said about it, DG is the worst place to work"
bad,"I enjoyed the customers.  I loved most of the customers and my boss.  Too much work expected of 2 people per shift.  A lot of standing and walking, stocking, cash register, receiving and checking in vendors and merchandise."
bad,"I reported theft and good things, on my end, did not come of it. The trainers are verbally abusive. HR does not look into any reports made. I was also sexually harassed by manager and all they did was replace him."
bad,"I worked my butt off the training was very poor there, the boss would talk to his employees in a unprofessional way. It was very stressful and under paid for all the work you would have to do."
bad,"Dealing customers with customers. Ringing up customers,  Stacking shelves. Cleaning,  help with opening and closing. Counting drawers. Customer service"
bad,Started as a good job then they got new manager and there was too much work not enough hours and there was drama that u get a headach with so few employees
bad,"When I worked at Dollar General I knew I was in for an exhausting time when I was interviewed and during the interview the manager was talking badly about current employees. In the weeks to come I came to the realization that I would have to do almost everything by myself while my manager would sit in the back room with the cameras and watch Cops all day while I busted my tail working, and they get reprimanded when I took a break to get something to drink from my own bottled water."
bad,High pace work environment I worked with a group of teenagers who never wanted to work came to work to do absolutely nothing ! Management was terrible hired all her friends and fired anyone who wouldn’t come in on their day off
bad,"Management is horrible, refuse to work with personal stuff, and if they do they complain for weeks. Not fair and you don’t get paid to do your job only, because you pick up everyone’s slack. Turn over rate is extremely high ."
bad,"Would not recommend the Dollar General to anyone. "
bad,Work life balance is a 0... they say   as a manager you only have to work 5 1/2 days a week .. what you end up working 6 days and sometimes 7 a week.. they do offer a good starting wage but never enough hours to get all the tasks done.. profits are all they care about. And surveys. Processing truck is a major deal butno way to control the inventory..
bad,The company is good to work for but management is awful at my location..Nasty attitudes. Vindictive. The environment is very hostile..the ones that work hard always get harrassed and hours are constantly being cut if management get mad at you
bad,"I would recommend working here as it is a great, cheap place for the community to buy items they need. I, however, do not agree in strong favor of the compensation and a few other areas of the store. Thank you."
bad,Please do not apply here. You get little benefits with garbage pay. They expect you to work like a slave and pay you like one too.  Upper management is a joke and they make their own rules.
bad,We were always behind on stocking the back room was always full and the manager just didn’t know what she was doing. I would not recommend working at dollar General they do not treat employees fairly or give you enough hours. I was not a key holder I was just a regular associate and I was fired when I didn’t do anything so that the key holder kept her job.  I do not recommend working there.
bad,They don’t pay you enough money to do what you have to do and get done there. Sometimes you could be the only one that’s working and you still get written up for doing the best you could. I don’t recommend any one working for this company you work to much and have to get things done in a certain time and you don’t get paid good at all not even minimum wage the only on whose pay is good is the store manager and the district manager is not a very nice person as well
bad,"The job there is very stressful and you are always busy and on your feet. I learned how to stock shelves, help vendors who come into the store. The management is poorly done, it should all be considered teamwork not just one sided. I really enjoyed working with most of my coworkers."
bad,I feel the company almost sets you up to fail  as a store manager it's the most awful unsafe  job I have ever worked in two months I was there my store broke into twice on top of few weeks before I started it was robbed by knife point you would think for that reason alone they would put more people in the stores at ALL times not just for security but to help stock
bad,"This company does not care about its employees."
bad,"Even if your district manager knows you are scheduled off a day they will still call, text or email you about things at the store they want you to do and expect you to complete it."
bad,"It was the worst. The manager never had anything done, the store was always a mess, and criminal things were happening but nothing was ever done. I would never recommend this business to anyone."
bad,"I hated every moment of this job. My boss sucked and gave me no lee-way for anything even though I was 6 months pregnant with twins at the time. I was expected to lug around 2 cases of water at a time even though it hurt me. When I needed a day off, I would be would manipulated into feeling bad for calling off. I made to feel stupid when I didn't know something. The place was always a disaster and my boss was no where to be found. I also caught her stealing from the store on several occasions but always was talking about how bad thieves are to her. I was completely miserable."
bad,"This was my second Least favorite job. These people have horrible management skills. I was never given time to train but expected to run the store, alone at times. I will never shop here again and I honestly hope the store is shut down."
bad,"District manager was a joke... Had an employee stealing and he would not let me terminate her or have her arrested.... "
bad,"You are lucky to 12 hours a week, rarely do you have the opportunity to be full time. The company is notorious for scheduling 1 person in the day time and having unrealistic expectations of that 1 employee. Rarely do you have 2 employees working an the pay is terrible. An adult with any bills cant survive on their pay alone. So be ready to have multiple jobs or no money."
bad,Bad management.  Wont work with working single moms. Unfair to employees. Tried to ask them to work with me and they wont . They cut your hours in instead.  They also argue with you and pretty much call you a liar when you was honest with them from the beginning of hire in telling them that you needed days because of your 3 children .
bad,This company especially the management core that was running that district was very bias and did not appreciate the effort anyone put out and when they dont want to pay you what u deserve they find minor reasons to get rid of you
bad,They expect you to live there and don’t want to pay nothing. Managers don’t know what they are doing neither does the district managers. Nobody knows anything pretty much
bad,"You can't make a living working at Dollar General. The work was easy but the pay is so low. Majority of the work is unloading boxes, stocking and working the register."
bad,"Don’t consider Dollar General is a place to work. They pay better than average retail at a certain level, but the worklife balance is horrible. Expectations are impossible and the management is transitory. Go anywhere else if you must stay in retail."
bad,Dollar General doesn't pay enough for the work they want done.  Management is is not at all where it should be.  There are times when there is only one person working almost the entire day. Two people at most at any given time. Which is a safety issue.
bad,I was told my productivity level was extremely high when I first came into dollar general and later I ask for a single day off and my hrs went from 35 to 5hrs a week once your scheduled 5hrs she pretty much doesn’t want you anymore.
bad,Store is poorly ran manager expect associates to pull all the weight and dont cashier when lines are backed up i know from experience i wouldnt work there again
bad,There were days that I (a part time key holder) was left to run the store by myself (barely 18 at the time). They had outrageous expectations of freight getting done while being the only associate to run a register. Could hardly even go to the bathroom in fear of someone running out of the door with a basket of stuff.
bad,"If you need a job, this will work. Though if you're looking for a quality, long-term employment I would not recommend. The management was and continues to be the main issue."
bad,"The worst job ive ever worked, minimum wage and you have to fight for hours. Management will cut your hours if you get sick for a few weeks after, i only got sick once and they cut my hours for four weeks because they felt i was “unreliable”"
bad,In my experience working there we were under staffed under paid and management were horrible at their jobs. The management is always calling out. They wouldn't do their jobs and would leave it for the next shift to do. They would leave the tasks that were meant for at least three people to do for the second shift that always had two people scheduled.
bad,"They kept cutting hours and adding task, as a manager I was expected to cover a ridiculous amount of hours. DG only cares about making money. The starting pay is so low, so it's hard to hire and keep a staff. DG gives the customer a voice by asking for them to do surveys but don't care at all about the employees. I know managers have huge responsibilities, but DG is ridiculous."
bad,"Stay away! company has high turnover and do not value its employees. They yell and curse at the District managers. There is favoritism and good old boys environment. Stay away,"
bad,I quit after three years it just keep going down hill there nobody to listen to u i called the dm sbout are mng he dont care he has other stores that all he say called hr and they was post to call u back never did and they have a cashier and somtimes it another person they want to get everything done and store mng can leave and show up her shift
bad,"I worked there for half a year. DO NOT EXCEPT TO HAVE ANY TIME OFF. Supervisors ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS KEEP YOUR BUSINESS TO YOURSELF. If you a minute late it's a point doesnt matter if u stopped by a train or its a car accident holding up traffic u will get that point they do not care. It is a production job if u don't meet production expect to be fired quickly. Doctor note = point. HR WILL NOT HELP YOU BUT ONLY HENDER YOU. If your ready to sacrfice your health mind and body then apply here. Within the months i worked there, I watched more then 30 walk out choose at ur own risk.. There is no room to grow in the place. If your a temp expect to be fired at the end of the year if they don't hire you on. And please if u do plan on quitting take pictures of your two weeks notice so they can't say they never recieve it."
bad,work 12 hour days sometimes. said I wouldn't be a closer and that is all I did was close store. counted till. make cash drops. waited on customers. stocked shelves.
bad,"Manager was spiteful and if she got mad at you would cut your hours, went into computer and changed hours, talked behind peoples backs and shared information about other employees she shouldn't, was dirty, wearing stained and dirty clothes, unkept and dirty looking."
bad,The customers there were really great not even an issue. Regulars shop there and they are so polite. Yet the management is horrible. Manager didn't care if you were sick or not even if you got sick at work. Also they had gnats everywhere so you would be working in hot weather (no a/c) with gnats in your face.
bad,"All of the store managers neglect to work their mandatory closing shifts.  My store manager picked and chose favourites and put herself first when it came to scheduling aka only every morning shifts.  My last day was one of the worst days ever.  I tried to get someone to cover my shift because I wasn't feeling well,  when nobody covered for me I put on my big kid pants and decided to power through a eight hour shift.  Three hours in my pain became excruciating.  To make a long story short I told the store manager I needed to go the hospital,  she wouldn't come in and the district manager couldn't find one person to cover for me. I quit on the spot because of the pain, turns out I had an ovarian cyst burst and the pain could've been managed if I had gone to the hospital when it first started.  Instead I stood for over three hours at a register in tears.  I would never reccommend working at dollar general to ANYONE."
bad,"Worked there for two months and ended up quitting because I couldn't put up with it anymore. At first it was great. I got the hours I needed when I first started and everything seemed to be going good. But once a month had passed my hours got cut down to two days a week because the manager had a time budget which meant she only had between 132-135 hours to spread out between all her workers yet instead of promoting employees she already had she hire new people which would cut into the employees hours that she already had. Yes I was a part time Sales Associate but there were other part time Sales Associates that were getting more hours than me. And you get minimum wage. More work and sucky pay. The manager wasn't organized and seemed to not really care about her employees. And also had customers that tried to complain on an employee and the employee gave the customer the store number instead of the Corporate office number like the customer had asked for and the customer ended up actually calling to complain on the employee and the employee pretended to be a  Corporate Employee and I knew that was against company policy. Plus several employees were constantly calling in once a week. So I got fed up, wiped my hands of it and quit. Not enough pay or hours to have to put up with all that plus the demands of the job that weren't your responsibility. So I'll NEVER work for another Dollar General Store again!!"
bad,Horrible company to work for. They don’t care about you at all. If you’ve been there for a few years they will push you out. Pay is horrible they only pay minimum wage and benefits are ok but could be better. Trying to get ahold of your district manager is impossible and they work you like a slave.
bad,While working here at dollar general I have an inconsistent schedule form week to week. The current manager is very understanding when asking for days off but the pay is degrading. Some of the management is rude and can cause customer dissatisfaction.
bad,My manager was terrible. She talked about customers badly on the sales floor. She talked about coworkers on the sales floor to other workers and customers. She was rude to a lot of customers. She was constantly on her phone or out smoking.  Would never go back to Appleton MN Dollar General even as a customer.
bad,"non-stop snitching and working manager personal motive or ego involved in management. Bold face lies being told at ""town hall meetings"". Extremely informative on the workload"
bad,Not a good company to work for. Management did everything to make the store managers habe no work life balance. Also a lot of the goals were unattainable. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Manager puts all his responsibilities on employees, while not doing his 45 hr work week.  Manager works less than a part time employee, total hours less than 30 while collecting a Manager's salary."
bad,"I took a management position in a rural store. I was never given enough hours to have a cashier during the day which required me to run the entire store by myself for 9 hours. I was unable to get things done that were required to keep the store stocked and “customer ready”. Whenever I would tell my DM that I was not willing to continue working in those conditions, nothing was done to increase the budgeted hours. The corporation does not care about their employees at all!"
bad,Most Store Managers are fine until any issues arrive that needs addressed. They would rather just get rid of you than actually handle the situation. Too much gossip and clicks amongst family that work together and some Managers allowed to speak badly to employees with no consequences. I wouldn't recommend this company to Anyone that is looking for a job. They promise a lot but deliver on much of nothing.
bad,"Management comes and goes, employees come and go. It depends on who you have. They can make it a fun place to work or a nightmare. When I worked there it was a nightmare. They are not supposed to be on your drawer. You get written up if your drawer was off even if the manager was on your drawer you are held accountable. If they decide they don't  like you they treat you terribly, make you feel uncomfortable, take away your hours until you quit or find another job. They wait for an opportunity to fire you. If they haven't  found one they make your work environment a living nightmare. You don't  get a review, they don't  give you a pay raise, and you don't  get trained unless they like you and want to take you under their wing or if you are their pet. You work your butt off with no breaks, some take many breaks or hardly work and you dont even get a discount. The same rules do not apply for all.  You are not appreciated if you come in on your day off or cover for anyone. But if you want a day off you dont get it. That is why they cant keep people. No respect, no fair consistent stucture, no professionalism. You work all holidays and dont get paid holiday pay! Inconsistent schedule. You work days and nights whatever they give you, you have to work. Hard work for little money, no incentives, no bonus, no perks, no vacation, no benefits, for what? Why would anyone work in a place like that? Unless you just need a paycheck for a little while."
bad,I would not recommend this job unless you are looking for a supplement to a more substantial job. Not good place for career oriented people. Here’s a bonus fact: the actual store managers are required to work 6 days a week year round!
bad,"Constantly  short staffed. My first store manager was awesome. General manager could not care less about employees and whether they got lunch breaks or relief constantly asking one key holder to close store by themselves, which is strictly forbidden. Regional manager is not any better. Claim to have open door policy but trying to reach HR is like trying to drive a car without gas."
bad,"Illegally expects you to work on breaks"
bad,Working at a dollar general is seriously not worth the stress. You will hate every second you are at work. You will sprint back and forth to check out customers while trying to complete tasks you have to do where the register is out of sight. You will walk down an aisle that looks like a tornado hit it and disassociate. I worked for DG for a year and it was the worst year of my life.
bad,"No family values. They treat their employees like dirt. Filthy, unorganized, money hungry corporation. Very expensive health benefits. Shady upper management."
bad,"If you need something on the side this is your place to work at, but if you want full time to cover the bills this company will not do it for you. I recommend other places with benefits and hourly wage that it worth it."
bad,Dollar General was an awful place to work. I was hired with a key holder/ management position and I was payed as a cashier. I would not recommend Dollar General to anyone.
bad,"* 55-75 hours a week with absolutely no work/life balance. After that, your still expected to be ""on-call"""
bad,Working here was stressful. The levels of favoritism were intense. The work load is abundant for low hourly wages. Its also dangerous. The theft and robberies are through the roof and no added protection in sight.
bad,"Management really does"
bad,"i learned a lot in management but it was more self taught.  Loved my customers, and my coworkers. Enjoyed my daily duties, the customers and my overall job."
bad,We were always understaffed. They gave hours to those who didn’t deserve/want them and those of us who did were left high and dry. There was never a manager on the floor and I was constantly over stocked to the point of  walk ways being prohibited. The assistant managers were lazy and rude and didn’t follow company guidelines. It was a very unsatisfactory work experience.
bad,"Hired on as a manager. Promised 5 and a half days to work. Always cut hours of staff forcing manager to cover those times. At times working by myself.  5 and a half eventually turned into 6, and sometimes 7 days working, working all day sometimes. No work/life balance, no support from upper management. Took a 3 day training course where the DM was suppose to follow up on what was taught and your business plan.......NEVER DONE.   Spent 1 week with Store Manager Trainer, they came down for a few days, fed to the wolves to figure it out.   Don’t fall for the trap."
bad,"They never give enough hrs. For more than a cpl. Of people per shift at a time. So you end up running register, stocking, fronting, cleaning, and all at minimum wage."
bad,"Fast paced without enough workers per shift so the customers were always upset.  I've had to work a double shift on several occasions by myself.  I never missed a day of work in the year I was employed with Dollar General.  I was never late,  came in on my off days, worked over my scheduled hours and then got written up because enough side work wasn't done...This was the most disorganized and ungrateful company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Supervisor jobs are horrible, you get drugged through the mud. Long hours nobody was smart enough for promoting to manager. I would not allow my dog to work there."
bad,"You are always given more assignments per shift than are possible to complete.  Understaffed.  Constantly running from cash register to stocking area without being able to efficiently fulfill either role.  Constant negative feedback from management.  Inconsistent hours.  Heavy lifting, climbing ladders, on your feet, no breaks."
bad,Only gave ppl part time jobs not fair no set schedule I wouldn't recommend it no benefits most of the time no breaks I believe it's corporate fault...
bad,"It took 6 months of speaking to recruiters and going back and forth to finally get the job at DG. I feel this is ridiculous.  After getting the job within your first 3 to 4 months you are supposed to go to training, After 1 month shy of my 1 year anniversary they finally were sending g me to training. I had a so called training manager, Honestly I learned more on my own and the overall matrix at my store proved it daily. I feel DG is shady, they ha e an arbitration agreement you sign but when you try to appeal their decision, they give you the run around, you leave a message and are told they will call back in 24-48 hours, I've called 2 and 3 times a week for almost 5 weeks and no one has called me back. I still have not gotten to make a statement on the reason I was terminated.  ERC is a joke....you cant u understand a word any of them say, they are all from the middle east....and they just dont care. Dollar General is by far the worst when it comes to putting their employees first, no family values, and very shady."
bad,At first working there wasn't that bad but when the manager act like I was bothering her when I needed help I decided that this wasn't the job for me simply because the management the poor.
bad,I worked non stop way to many hours told them several times I needed help or better training got nothing they work you to death andbthen expect you to keep working from grave.
bad,"This job was very demanding for minimum wage pay. At most times there would only be two people working. It was constant running to the cashier register or stocking. Very little training. The customers that shop there are the worst. Especially when someone decides they don’t want something are it’s been scanned. Now you got to run around looking for the one only other person for key. Also they thought it was okay to interrupt your break if the lines were to long. Here’s a thought, hire/require more people for a shift."
bad,"We used to have a blast. It has changed soooo much and it makes me so sad. I literally cry because I would love to go back. But its not the same. And Im not sure itll go back. Ya know. U cannnn have fun at work, we used to. But when u get made to be so serious all the time,  it sucks."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid, that's a good place to start. No room for advancement, and the turnover rate was really high. Management was unreliable, no sense of unity or teamwork."
bad,Did not accommodate anything and wasn't up to date with any licenses also they never worked with people everyone was rude to customers and breaks were very limited
bad,Not a place where supervisors are required to set their personal opinions aside.  Pay is less than comparable retailers. You can get satisfaction from a job well done.
bad,"Messy , unprofessional, needs new management , great company and can expand if under the right managers and good workers . Needs improvement , needs help"
bad,The corporate management is terrible and does not have realistic goals in place. Employees are expected to do the work of several people with very few hours to do them.
bad,No support with upper management.  Company doesn't care about their employees or store managers.  Poor communication and no response when help is requested from management.
bad,It was goid at first until everything changed its one way or no way nobody cared and it sewmed like they dont care who works there as ling as they gwt theyer way i was so happy to work there but how i was treated was never okay
bad,Would not recommend Dollar General to anyone for employment. Keep opening stores when they can not staff the ones they have. They will use and abuse you
bad,"While gaining experience with a slew of different types of people, you also are given the opportunity to learn just how much stress and degrading comments you can take. Management often don't care about their employees and are often corrupt in their own way."
bad,"Pay is minimum wage, no matter is you are qualified or never done any retail or cashier positions. Management was terrible at this location. Was given decent hours at first, then manager kept taking me off the schedule saying dont come in. Management expects you to ring up customer fast but to but slow down to make sure you are mentioning survey on receipt every time. cant make management happy either way."
bad,"the managers dont give you proper training. no one does their job (my manager sat in the office all day eafting). oh and dont expect that keyholder position/raise they promised you either. it aint gonna happen. "
bad,"( San Antonio DC first shift)  Unless order selecting is your thing  , i wouldnt even apply because you might end up doing it, They put general warehouse on the description so they can put you where they want.  It wont matter if your good at it. You will be stuck , They force you to be good at it. If you ask to try something else , they won't allow it . fullcase position is a revolving door , if you do apply make sure you do not end up in full case selecting and make it a point!!!, a couple of supervisors  in full case are more like wannabe  thugs who make points by intimidating you , and  strong arming you. You will not work from 6 to 3 or 3:30 pm, its more like be inside by 5:45am and start work at 6am and your leaving at 5 or 6 pm. It also goes by how fast you pull your last order. Orders can be from 30 min to an hour long .  Guys hide from orders at the end of the day. So they pick who will get two orders at one time or just one. So if your slower , you will leave late. No one is treated equally . Theres favorites.  everyone finishes and leaves at different times. You won't get out as a whole.  It will get old and you will get burned out,  Theres some lucky shorter hours , but not much. You will work fridays too. Dont let them say you wont . Sometimes all day. 3rd shift or night shift won't do their part at times so first shift ends up having to stay later . the amount of work they expect to get done is outrageous! The time you have to pull are too. 3rd shift people call in alot so they make 1st shift work 1  sunday every month I guess but they tell you to work sunday as"
bad,Working for Dollar General was experience of all the retail jobs that I've been working this one was a challenge Dollar General it was okay to work for them
bad,"DG is a major power house in the retail world after 10yrs of service I know a thing or two about how the operate and how the keep the bottom line profitable. Don't fix anything unless threatened with a fine,"
bad,Even in a high theft area there will only ever be 2 people in the store.  Low average sale and high customer traffic means you will be at reg all shift.  No one to take care of customers nor stock store.
bad,"Great concept, locals need management that really cares about what they do otherwise, store will fall apart."
bad,"i only worked here for four months, the employees were great but the customers were horrible and the district manager was an idiot, cut hours and wondered why we was behind. 12 hour days left no room for any kind of life."
bad,"The manager would leave me at the store for long periods of time alone because people wouldn't show up to their shifts, and she refused to come in. The bathroom was always ridiculously dirty, people were always stealing. Management could hardly keep receipt paper or bags in the store, we were always having to borrow it from another store. Understaffed, underpaid."
bad,"Management difficult to work with, staffing impossible. As they want to pay everyone minimum wage. Regardless of the demographics of the store and the distance one must travel to get to work. Nothing was easy about this job, training came three months after being hired. Human resources refused to help and get involved in anything that dealt with your staff, even if it was too acknowledge your staff for a great job. "
bad,DO NOT GO TO DOLLAR GENERAL. CRAZY HOURS MINIMAL PAY AND MAXIMUM DISRESPECT. You cannot trust the managerial staff of Arizona City's Dollar general. They will make sure you don't find another job with DG in Arizona.
bad,"I would unload trucks, put out stock on it’s proper row , run cash register, sweep and mop floor at end of the shift, case cut promotional items, and help customers"
bad,There is poor management and inconsistent hours. They want you to work but barley want to pay you. You could leave @11-11:30 the night before but have to be there @6 the next morning. There’s not really any benefits. Not even a discount. It’s also minimum wage
bad,"I never got over 15 hours while I worked at Dollar General, and half the time the manager was on vacation. Closing shift was always under staffed and not only do you have to take care of your responsibilities but most of the time you also have to do whatever day shift employees did not finish for example, not putting away their returns, or recovering the store during the day."
bad,Its the job for you If you dont want a life and if you want to work for free. It's a high turn over rate because people dont realize how much they have to do for little pay.
bad,A typical day at that job was pretty much disappointing and stressful cuz the managers just didn't do there jobs at all. The best part about working there was interfering with the wonderful customers. The difficult part about working there is when your not a manager and you have to do the manager duties cause they don't do what their suppose to do.
bad,"I was an employee for almost 2 years until recently, as my manager fired me without reason or notice after having to go to the hospital from a work related injury and not being able to work immediately afterwards."
bad,"My experience was not good working here. I was mistreated by a lot if the other staff members, forced to work a stick night shift sometimes in a unsafe internment. Store was robbed 3x while I worked there an for low pay was not worth it to me."
bad,"I was 17 years of age , it was a part time job paying $ 8.00 an hour and I did not recieve enough hours to keep working there . I did learn how to communicate better with people but I would not work there again because of the schedules."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months in those 6 months we had two different managers and the last 2 months no manager at all. We had to talk to district management and another women who I still am not certain what her title was. When I asked for more hours they cut my hours by 10 the next week when I told them I had 1 person dying in my family and 2 people very sick so I would need to really lessen my hours due to serious family issues they upped my hours by 15...no schedule was posted so I asked the day before what time I had to work the next day if I even did and no answer until 7pm that night and they told me I was to be there at 730 in the am..when I said theres ko way I'd be able to find a babysitter this late for that early I was told I either had to show up or hand in my keys. After i handed in my keys because I wasnt able to find a babysitter with such short notice I text the district manager and asked for confirmation for proof he got the keys and he ignored that message and a second one asking. "
bad,I worked at dollar general for 8 years I started out as a cashier then worked my way up to a lead sales associates and the I moved up to a asm and then moved up to a store manager... then in five mins my new dm came in a fired me over a post that a post on fb and it didn’t say anything about Dg or you can’t even tell it was taken at Dg... Dg don’t care how much time you put into your store and how hard you work for them.. they don’t appreciate ya at all or every recognize your hard work and what you do for them...
bad,"I worked in the Tifton, Georgia Dollar General. The one that I worked at had a horrible smell to it. The store manager had her favorites that she would give hours to. It’s good for a college student but not for surviving"
bad,I constantly got called in on my days off. I faced verbal abuse by an immediate supervisor in front of customers just because he had a bad day.  Manager would never work a double shift but would constantly ask me to and the one time I needed a specific day off he scheduled me any way and then told me it wasn't his problem when I told him I had requested because I didn't have child care. Do yourself a favor and don't work here unless you are desperate
bad,It really sucks. Management doesn’t know what their doing and they expect cashiers to do all the work on long shifts while they sit in their office and do nothing
bad,The manger had a horrible attitude and it was so very unorganized. The manager got into an argument with her boyfriend and I was fired. Tried to call corperate never got through to anybody so I just gave up. Come to find out she still works there.
bad,Working for DG was the worst. They pay the minimum and do not give raises. They do not value their customers or their employees. Taking time off is like pulling teeth. Worst retailer ever.
bad,"I loved the job, but once I took over as manager at a store things began to change in not so great way. They expect you to go by there way even if it still cost them money."
bad,Dollar General is awful when it comes to keeping their customers and employees happy. They never give enough hours to make a living and they rarely promote within. I do not recommend working for this place if you have bills to pay and a family to feed because they do not care about you and will hire your replacement before you even step one foot out of the building.
bad,Constantly stay busy and is always work to do. Alot of customer interaction. Always on your feet. Very Fast paced environment. Have to Have a level head to deal with all the different people that you see. Have to stay ver professional.
bad,My experience working at Dollar General was highly stressful. While I've been working here the management has been completely unreliable or expecting miracles. It's a lot of work for barely any pay and no benefits. You don't even get discounts. They expect the world of their limited workers while giving hardly any means to achieve them.
bad,"Constantly doing work and running all over the store for bad pay and unpaid time, would not recommend unless you absolutely need a job or need to be humbled by your community"
bad,Working here was one of my most stressful jobs. The management was to unprofessional and unorganized. The are not many job advances if any and raises are annual and not even noticeable. Unless you are management this is not a place to work and try to maintain a normal lifestyle.
bad,"My store was constantly filled with irate customers, complaining over the machines that would shut down every other hour (never replaced by corporate, even when renovations were done,) often had spoiled or molded foods, little to no security (when not an employee I have seen people enter with empty purses and leave with full ones, the lack of security is baffling,) and often my higher ups spent the entire day on ""smoke breaks"" while I dealt with all the customers. Due to the fact that we aren't allowed to be at the cash register, many people would just walk out with their stuff without paying, especially considering there were no alarms. Our store saw over 30 employees join and quit in less than 2 months. It was bad."
bad,"Very high stress...I worked from them in two different states and the stress level never changed. I believe the company was started with good intentions, but they put people in charge that offer no support of their employees and poor communication."
bad,This place has horrible management and they work their favorite people more than anyone else. Management talks bad about fellow employees and places them into positions that they are not comfortable to work.
bad,"You will be consistently short staffed as the company refuses to provide enough hours to keep the store in working condition. The bonus's are non existent, pay is far from competitive with no benefits. As a shift manager you will only make fifty cents an hour above the associates (minimum wage) but will be expected to complete the same duties as a store manager. The hours are inconsistent and the turnover rate is high. This should be a last resort paycheck."
bad,"Management was horrible, they did nothing all day but yell and complain about the cashiers not getting enough literacy! They overwork you for lik pay!"
bad,Management does not do the job that they should be doing. Dollar General grossly under pays. Does not care what staff have to deal with. 4-5 staff can not stock and run a store in the time frame they are expecting.
bad,A typical day at work included working jobs that were not in the job description and that you weren't getting paid for.  There was not room for advancement.
bad,"Don't do it, don't even think about it, just find something is unless you can thrive on stress, hypertension, high blood pressure, ulcers, fatigue, and depression."
bad,"However I never truly feel like I have job security with DG. Also the company does not give enough hours to have more than 2 people per shift, and that makes it difficult when busy. and they do not do refresher courses of your CBL's"
bad,"The company lets you know they think you are a thief from the start. start at min wage with no hours. Wont work with employees on a set sched.  This company needs a union desperately so they have to stop treating employees like thieves.  "
bad,"Better staffing. Management with better attitudes, proper training, better pay. Allow employees to free go on lunch break instead of working through it."
bad,"In fairness, the one I worked for is in a small town, but that shouldn't be an excuse. This is after all a place of business and people who are not the typical 'white' and 'straight' norm should be able to work without being constantly harassed. Management did nothing to prevent it, and even excused the harassment."
bad,Expected to much out of the four hours I was on the floor and could not come close to pleasing store manager I tried the very best that I could but I came up short too much for her
bad,"I enjoyed the fast pace. I was the cashier and stocker  all the same time which is fine if you have back-up when needed.No support from management.My night-time manager was great. We got a new asst. manager and she thought she could speak down to people , she tried to be little me, counsel me in front of customers. Went to HR nothing happened.She got promoted.It was like they just hire people to fill the holes.My personal opinion is they do not care about employees or customers."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General consisted of having massive amounts of truck to put away never enough room for any of it, along with unrealistic goals on how fast and efficiently it needed to be done."
bad,"I was promised to be made a key holder but after 6 months I was told it wasn't going to happen. Manager cared more about socializing than getting work done. Never held people accountable for their mistakes, talked about his employees behind their back in a rude way.  For $8 an hour and only worked 12 hours a week it wasn't worth all the drama. I would gladly go back if that store got a new store manager and the place paid more or offered more hours."
bad,"The manager was absolutely awful. She had no personality and was very rude and unfriendly! The employees were afraid to talk to her about anything. My pay wasn't enough for my position, and the schedule was madness."
bad,pay is minimum wage.  This is insane that any company in 2018 would pay so low. Equipment is inadequate and constantly malfunctions. Co workers were nice.
bad,"The only good thing about this job is that it was starting experience that I could put on a resume. Other than that, it's a total waste of time. Working as a cashier at Dollar General, you are expected to be working at 100% productivity at all times- for minimum wage."
bad,"dollar general is a joke! I have worked 6 weeks and the schedule has changed 14 or 5 times, if the store manager doesn't want to work a day the schedule changes and the rest of us get screwed over! it is nuts!"
bad,Managers and employees are overwhelmed and overworked.   Upper management is the problem.  They have no idea what goes on in the store.  Not enough hours released to managers to have employees do their job.  Upper management drops by to inspect but really has no idea.  It's cut throat in a way that anyone thinking about advancing will cut your throat in order to do so and upper management will reward this.  I will pick up cans off of the side of the road before I ever work for a dollar general again.
bad,"This job had me working at two different stores opening and closing another you open the store without a cashier and still have trucks arriving that you have to unload. The pay was terrible when I started, I could not afford to continue to work here. Seemed like a good place to get promoted but would have taken to long for me."
bad,You are under appreciated. The person below the manager will give you something to do AND take credit for it. Some of the key holders let the title get to their heads. Seniority means absolutely NOTHING to them. Bad management loses good employees! That’s is a big reason that DG has a big turn around with employees. Especially the younger management that has no real clue on how to be an awesome manager/asst. manager/ key holder.
bad,When I first started it was cool and very fun then I always noticed that the 2 managers that was over the whole store they would always do work for about 10 mins then would go outside and talk and smoke for 1 hour to 2 hours while the employees in the store did all the work then the managers try and take credit like they did all the work  I went from working 3 days out the week to working 1 day out the week making like 20-30 dollars
bad,bad district managers fire people like crazy for stupid reasons. don't take care of employees. benefits are expensive. overall bad company to work for.
bad,"Stores are shipped excessive freight & given restricted allotted workload, or have inadequate staffing. Making it nearly impossible to get everything out in expected time. Therefore creating an environment where staff is expected to work like mules to accomplish excessive work. "
bad,"Open store, count safe and tills, sweep and mop store, freight, daily paperwork. The majority of your day was spent unloading freight which was very difficult to complete because the store was always understaffed."
bad,Dollar General is a company that cares very little about its employees and it shows in the work place. Ask anybody who has left Dollar General behind and they can reassure you that you are better off looking for an alternative job. If it is the only option then prepare yourself to be overworked and underpaid just to be treated very poorly by fellow employees and bosses. Good Luck.
bad,"Worked with this company 2 different times and the"
bad,Turn over rates are crazy because they pay minimum wage and expect the employees to do the work of ten People. There is no appreciation. Just negative
bad,Not a good company to work for.They value opening stores more than paying their store managers enough money and having enough payroll and employees to have in their stores to work.They don't even offer sick pay.
bad,"your day start with receiving stock , running the register and customer service.as a manager work 10 hours a day.The most enjoyable was the customers."
bad,Management was very disrespectful to not only coworkers but also customers and Store manager was condoning the horrible behavior. I was belittled and called outside of my name upon numerous occasions.
bad,"I would never recommend this job to anyone. If you have any kind of bills I wouldn't recommend you work here unless it's a management position because they are full time and get all the hours. And even then it's not enough pay for all the work you have to do, or the stress you endure. And they make employees work off the clock. ALL THE TIME!!!"
bad,Lack of communication. Poor treatment of employees. Lack of gratitude for working long hours. No work/life balance. Bad leadership. Very stressful environment
bad,"It's a super stressful job, have to work 60+ hrs every week and only get paid for 40. And pay is not that good for the job you have to do. It's pretty cutthroat, they throw you to the wolves."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to the one I worked at which was at Malone. Shelves are always bare and everyone basically sits on their butts while the newbie attends at the register. Management sucks  they can’t keep a manager for more then a week.
bad,"Very Stressful. Place is ran poorly. Employees are not held responsible if they do not complete their work. Many sat around doing nothing, leaving managers to complete all work. GM hired girlfriend and there was a lot of favoritism in the place."
bad,"A typical day at DG involved inventory in some way. Weather working back stock or putting truck away. "
bad,6 days a week. 4am truck delivery alone. scheduled alone open or close for 2 to 3 hours. stick to a structured game plan or you will fall far behind. the customers and co workers was the best part.
bad,not enough hours to waste your time working there no benefits cant pay bills or even eat on the pay checks from there/. they schedule you to work only with one other person and at night you are expected to recover the store clean the store and pay close courtious attention to all customers. written up on next working day if all wasnt done to satisfaction no matter how busy you were with customers.
bad,"The DG that I worked at was absolutely awful. The store manager was extremely disorganized, she was too young to be in her role, and she favored people of the same skin color as her. She gave away my shifts without asking me first and then when I offered to give somebody else my hours, she cut me back because it ""seemed like I didnt want them"". Terribly unprofessional."
bad,"Was promised 20 hours or more a week that didn't happen, drama with coworkers, the manager and new district manager were the worst I've ever had, blame id placed on everyone but the person it should."
bad,My schedule almost changed every other day whenever the Store manager called me . And if you said no he was nasty as he'll.  They send you to other stores but don't want to give you money for gas.
bad,"Corporate has no direct contact with store, the person several states away jumps to conclusions. Dedicated employees get burned out on demands of working with no local contact,  DM located over an hour away,  and has no time but one day a month for three hours to review store operations.  After a devastating event, armed robbery, no support for the remaining store employees."
bad,As a member of management you are required to work a 6 day work week and 70-90 hours per week. 15-20 hour days are not unusual. Senior management thinks that intimidation is the way to motivate.associates. Store associates are paid far less than they should be.
bad,"The company says come grow with us , but there is favortisim, They want you to do alot  of work while being on the register. Then being key holder , there is alot of  work to be done, you have to constantally go to the register for the cashier. or for customer problems.  The Company wont hire the people to accomplish the work. that they want.to be done which puts alo, alot, alot of stress on managers and key holders so you can't work efficiently. I personally loved the job. ,but hated the stress and favortism."
bad,The store is ran with only two people and there is an endless list of things to do. You feel like you are always behind when working and will never get caught up. Overtime is also a huge no-no.
bad,"Terrible place to work. They pay minimum wage and give you minimum hours, or they over-work you completely. It's impossible to get done all the tasks they set for you during your shift and then you're punished for not getting it done. I like most of my co-workers, but from the manager to the regional manager things are difficult, and there's no one to talk to about it because they're all pushing for the impossible."
bad,"Only way I would suggest this job is if you have no where else to go or if it's a first job ever worked. No beneficial advantages what so ever, they don't even off discounts for employees. Upper level does not care about employee problems and will not work with you unless you break your neck and slave for them."
bad,"Not a consistent company to work for. If you are smart this company is not for you. You dont have freedom to grow your store or make business move that can better your store."
bad,"It was one of the worst jobs I  ever encountered. Store manager was 23 and had no clur. Back stockroom filled to emergency exit doors. Store floor filled with weekly stock. No custmets could get around to shop. No modulars set. Months behind. Merchandise all over the placr and aisles were filled with products on floor. It was a dirty and trashy. No leadership"
bad,"The job it's self isn't bad at all. Running the cash register and stocking the shelves, cleaning. Management is what needs the most help. The managers talk to their employees very badly and even in front of customers. Employees treated very badly. Would not recommend."
bad,"It was my first job, so I didn't know what to expect. There was a lot of work to be done at all times. The manager would disappear into the store to stock all day, and in between customers, you were also in charge of stocking the store. You basically had to constantly watch the store for customers, but couldn't just stand up there waiting for people to come in. I was spoken to a few times for not ""doing enough"" even though I was supposed to multi-task. "
bad,Was wrongfully terminated for something that was an honest mistake.  People have done much worse and still have their job. I would not recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
bad,"Key Holders have been reduced to part time cashiers, hour cut, no focus on customer service and certainly not store appearance and conditions. Any manager with any sort of pride in quality of work should not waste their time with this company."
bad,"Hostile work place , Schedule 1 employee to do so many tasks, which takes away from serving the customers. Dirty and untidy due to scheduling. CEO not responsive to employees needs. Overall salary is 7.25 an hour for hard working young people trying to pay for school. On a positive note , it was close to home."
bad,we were lied to they said we be home every day maybe once a week gone but that wasnt true no way that could have happened with the routes they handed us..
bad,"the hours are very inconsistent, the pay will always stay min wage even though the work detail will increase. the system is set up so the dollar general company doesnt have to pay for benefits( meaning you  will stay a part time employee)"
bad,they work their store managers to death. and have little payroll hours so the store manager makes up the time. pays associates minium wage . and work less than 40 hours
bad,I was an assistant manager that ran a store un trained for 6 months with little to no help. The company expects a lot of work done for little pay. Doesnt take care of employees
bad,"The company pushes for unattainable goals. They pentalize a single employee for not being able to do the amount of work that a team of 8 should be doing,. 90% of the time, I was the only employee in the store durring the busiest time of day, on truck days, where i needed to work freight, but couldnt even step away from the register for 4+ hours at a time."
bad,A typical day at work is mainly stocking being on the register majority of your day. I didn't learn anything the manager seemed as if they never had time for anything or to help out employees. Didn't like the management there at all. It was a very easy job.
bad,"Dollar General is a bare-bones operation, with outdated equipment, poorly-maintained and unsafe stores and a ridiculously low compensation package, especially considering the amount of work required for the pay. All of the stores are badly under-staffed and the training is extremely inadequate."
bad,"this is not the job for me but hey it is income which is what I need. I don't enjoy using a cash register system that dosent work well and is full of errors, also there is not much help if the store gets really busy because there is not much people working. the stores are general messy like a tornado went through it all the time and the shelves are always low and OOS due to the lack of help or employees. there is no employee perks at all with this company other then just getting through the day without getting yelled at by cranky customers"
bad,"My manager told me she was not in charge of setting up my hours."
bad,"Management chooses their favorites. District Manager refuses to update registers and hand scanner. "
bad,"As the manager I did shipping, receiving, ordering, hiring, firing, inventory, training, profit and loss, payroll, banking, cash deposits and balancing. No time off, 65 plus hours a week, and no support from District or regional managers."
bad,I liked working here but i feel a lot could have been better. The managers could have shown more interest and the workers could have worked a little harder.
bad,"Clock-in, make sure you count down your drawer. and get started check with your manager on duties for your task of the day.Help out the customers as mush as you can."
bad,"I worked there while pregnant with my son and was ordered to throw freight anyways. The hours suck, the pay sucks, management had no clue what they were doing. One day while at work, I started bleeding heavily and afraid of miscarriage I told my manager I needed to leave and go to the hopital. She told me I would be fired if I left."
bad,"A typical work day was you doing multiple jobs at once but nothing you ever do is enough. Management never did any work but complained about the work we, the employees, did. The hardest part of the job was the fact that I couldn't do anything right no matter how hard I tried."
bad,"Management gets no home life! 6 day work week and one day off. Your one day off may be the day of a required conference call so maybe no day off whatsoever. Pay is terrible for the amount of hours they require you to work. Call outs constantly, not enough hours to give staff, truck always late, and your expected to stay due to call outs and even put in more hours. It's an out of control mess! Dm doesn't communicate hardly at all. Then tells you one thing and changes her mind and tells you something totally different the next minute. While acting as she never told you what she originally said. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone!"
bad,"I Would Not Recommend Anyone To Work There , The Pay Is Low , They Expect You To Unstock And Be Cashier At The Same Time And Make Sure You See Every Customer That Walks In The Door And Also Make Sure You've Done What Your Suppose To Do"
bad,Dollar general is not a good company to work for. For my location at least. There can only be TWO associates working at a time to cut down on cost. This unfortunately leads to a lot of theft. That and you are timed as you stock while the management just sits and watches with a clipboard. Doesn't feel like a team effort.
bad,"The staff were not willing to work together as a team to accomplish the needs of the store. It (the store) fell behind on productivity. Customer satisfaction was at an all time low but because there is not a grocery store in the area customers were forced to shop there when majority of the time the items needed were out of stock. When we gained a new manager he helped to get the store back running like it was supposed to be. Fully stocked, better staffing, better hours and just an all around better quality working environment."
bad,go in and get the amounts and the batches. learn how to pick and stock.  work as fast as you can to make your rate and overrate to get a bonus.  fast paced
bad,"Corporate does not want anyone to get overtime, but they expect you to come in whenever they call and be sent home when they run out of hours on budget.  They do not feel that an employee with their company has any life outside of work.  In addition they do not compensate appropriately for the positions."
bad,"Decent hours "
bad,"horrible experience.. i will never in my life work at dollar general for as long as i live. bad benefits and alot of bad attitudes, they no longer get my buisness."
bad,if you want to work at a place that works you 12hrs a day 5 days a week and threaten with working saturday for months on end dollar general is the place for you. you get 2 15min breaks from pick to pick if your late thats a write up when you work more than 10hrs in a day depending how the management feel that day you might get an extra 10min break. long story short this company will chew you up and spit you out with its 98 or higher turnover rate. i would not recommend this place to anyone no matter how much i hate the person or how bad they need a job
bad,I don't know if it was the company or just the location that I worked at. It wasn't very well run. But I must say that going in there as a customer before I worked there should have thrown up a million red flags.
bad,"Management is absolutely horrific. Bad customer service, no incentives or team work, and all around depressing and over stressful place. Upper management never takes responsibility for their wrong doings, and doesn't try to make the situation better."
bad,Management changed so much at my location that it was like starting over every time a new one came aboard.............................................
bad,"Productivity of the store could've been handled differently and management could've been better but overall, I liked working with the customers."
bad,"always running 7000 sq store with 2 people ,short staffed and theft by consumers was undescrible, getting assaulted weekly"
bad,this is not a place to work as a cashier or management. the company does not care about you at all. they only care about getting the shelves stocked
bad,"it's a good, clean workplace to work at, the manager is so helpful they make you feel comfortable anyway possible, the customer service is great and I would recommend this job to anyone."
bad,This company will work you all day.  The work is very hard and is bad on the body.  There is no job security because of how the district managers treat the store managers.
bad,A typical day was stocking shelves and straightening up the store. I learned that it requires more than one to two people to operate a profitable store.  The culture was to operate at minimum staff and the manager to work 6 days a week most of the time open to close. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people and reaching sales goals.  The hardest part was controlling the inventory with a minimum staff.
bad,"all around bad, terrible management.  typical day at work is where the managers did not make sure the store was straight nor making sure the employees were doing their jobs correctly"
bad,The only reason I stayed so long with Dollar General was because I had an amazing boss. The company itself is horrible. They never have a decent schedule. They work their employees to death with a skeleton crew. Unreasonable expectation from everyone.
bad,"A lot of hard work. Dg never has enough employee scheduled to  work the proper work load.The paid is Minimum wage with exception of  production work.In reality they never have more than one or two employee in the store at all schedule time."
bad,"Job expectations versus hours allotted to complete tasks are not logical. Management is very disrespectful, no training provided. I would not recommend working for this company to anyone."
bad,"My store had little to no concept of how to run anything. The organization of the store was horrible from the get-go, management quit 1 week after I had arrived and hours were very spotty. Paid 7.75 an hour to get no benefits, no training, and no opportunity t all to advance within the company. Do not work here and support such corrupt practices."
bad,"A constantly changing work environment alongside poor management, degrading superiors, and unrealistic expectations make for a workplace like Dollar General."
bad,"Store management was very poor, contacted DM after a issue i had with my manager and they wanted to demote Me. Burlington CO Dollar General is horribly ran the store looked bad instead of the store manager getting reprimanded I did when i did my responsibility. "
bad,"You're given several tasks and expected to get them all done plus 100 percent recovery everynight, plus skyshelves, plus cig count. You're pretty much always in trouble, and if you actually do something right, nobody notices....but you bet if you do something wrong it's the talk of the store! Managers talk about employees behind their back."
bad,The people I worked with are great but the job is terrible. Basically you are working hard for minimum wage and no room for promotion. Poor management.
bad,"almost 2 yrs and no raise just its in the works!"
bad,"Job offered no room for growth, minimum wage pay, and managers were not helpful and didn't treat all employees equally and fair."
bad,"I wasn't trained at all , i learned how to work the cashier and all the things required to know all by myself such as what to enter when someone is using foodstamps , how to process a check for payment , etc. i was told i didnt get breaks on certain days , i was left with a long line of customers when there were two employees in the store present myself and another person ."
bad,you work about 4 hours a day trying to stock shelves and work the cash register on top of assisting other customers. the only thing i enjoyed is getting off
bad,I am only a part time worker.  It is the only place I could get to work due to needing a job right away.  I stayed home with my daughter until she was 5.  I became single and had to work to provide for her.  I am trying to get a full time job with any benefits available. I really appreciate anything you may can offer.
bad,"Pay is awful, some workers don't like to work an the dm makes excuses for them when you decide to fire them. Dg needs to decide on if they want there managers to run the store or quit to them not allowing the managers to get rid of the ones that don't want to work  and do their job"
bad,This was by far the most awful place to work. My manager was a pill head junkie who.didn't want to pull her weight the assistant manager was an alcoholic who smelled of liquor daily. Once the.manager left my self and the assistant worked 50 plus days straight .
bad,"This was an okay job to work at while I was in college, the corporate workers do not care about the stores or the employees that work in the stores."
bad,"Helping customer i enjoyed always. "
bad,"Depending on if you opened or closed would determine what you did that day. I mainly closed. Most shifts were 12-1030pm. I was a 3rd Key. I would have separate tasks than level 1 sales associates. Tuesday- Friday was working all backstock product, and setting new plannograms. Saturday-Monday is when we would get our truck. Around 9:00 pm is when I would have to count cigarettes and start the closing routine. Inside management was terrible. I hated working at this company. Store manager was inappropriate 99% of the time. There was never a set schedule. Half the time last minute call-ins on your day off or a day you requested off. The building I worked in was terrible as well. Floor  was ripped up, roof would leak, mouse problem. Just all around disgusting."
bad,Working at one of DC is terrible!  Management is the worst I've ever seen...well unless you kiss their butt then you can get away with anything and your supervisor and manager will protect your job.
bad,"Manager was rude with employees as well as customers and the cashiers received many complaints about her. "
bad,a typical day for me at work was hard. I enjoyed my job duties. I did not like the way upper management handle things. They only listened to the store managers and not the other employees. The lower level employees didn't have a voice and to me that is not fair.  Everyone should have the same voice
bad,"Management is awful, they treat their employees like garbage. They don't pay well, and they expect you to break your back for them."
bad,"they always want things done yesterday,you always feel like you have to watch over your shoulder,....i enjoy the customers,being a people person my self..i connected with the customers,...i took a store over that was doing really bad  and less than 6 months turned into money maker,..co workers  would stab you in the back the first chance they got....."
bad,"Working conditions are not that great, you get little to no breaks or lunch. Was forced to work over my time and did not get payed for it. The co-workers and managers aren't professional, and gets into argument with customers."
bad,"Do not work for this company. I hired in as a Store Manager Candidate, but was promoted with 2 weeks to Store Manager. The store they gave me was impacted when I took it over. I had 4 employees including myself after they cleaned house when I took it over. Within a month they came in and pretty much told me I was lazy. I had just finished working 70 hours that week. They wouldn't help get people hired for me, wouldn't send a smart team in to help get the store unimpacted, and told other store managers not to help me either. My DMs plan the whole time was to get the assistant from another store in to take my position. I pretty much gave them the bird and told them, I hadn't seen my kids more than 5 hours since I had worked for them and my family was more important than a job and working for a company who does not care about their employees. I actually had an employee's spouse call and threaten me several times and my DM also took their side over mine. I worked 6 hours by myself that day and had to continually look over my shoulder to make sure that crazy wouldn't show up. The hours I had to get the few employees meant many long days mostly by myself so how was I supposed to get anything done. I will never work for or ever shop at Dollar General again."
bad,"Working at this store was not a good experience. Manager was over bearing. Regional manager was very unethical. When my kids were sick, I was the only one to take care of them and the manager went as far as to prove it with notes from my KID'S doctor or receipts to prove I had taken my child to the pediatrician."
bad,"I have been to every store in my district to assist in running these stores. This is not a problem because I have a strong work ethic. However, I have been taken advantage of and not compensated for my extra efforts. In fact, I have been held to such a high level of expectation that one slight mistake at ANY of the multiple stores I work in results in penalization."
bad,"I worked at Dollar General as a manager for 10 years. I loved my job for various reasons, the customers, and my work family. Then the demands of Dollar General got out of control. The workload got harder and the payroll hours diminished. I was tired of working 6 days a week and the required 48 hours. We used to be closed for certain holidays, now they are open til 8 pm for those holidays. Dollar General does not care about family time for their employees. Dollar General ruins good people and they should take a good look at themselves and the turnover in the managerial positions they are constantly trying to fill. I do not have anything nice to say about the management of Dollar General. The hardest part of the job was working 6 days a week and missing so much of family time that I will never get back and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my work family everyday and our favorite customers"
bad,"Not enough support from the Field Managers, too many stores for one person too handle. Management is asked to have too many responsibilities that make it difficult for a good work/life balance."
bad,"I enjoy a challenge and I like to learn new things. This job was very good in those areas. I learned a lot of valuable information.  And I like fast pace work, this company has that as well."
bad,They expect a lot from you with out the means to accomplish the job. The job itself is not hard it is the management that make things more difficult than they need to be.
bad,"To go along with poor management, and poor pay for the responsibilities given, you have to micromanage yourself along with others. There is no teamwork & no cohesion."
bad,A typical day working here would be co workers walking out .Four mangers in one month . I did  not ike this job at all. They did not take care of there people.Would go in to work  no one there. not even managment
bad,"Management sucks. No training, don't care how they talk to employees, don't  use no tack or diplomacy .The pay needs to be better and each store needs to let employees get at least 20 hours a week."
bad,The hours were ok. I learned a lot about the position I worked. Management was something that definitely needed to be worked on. I absolutely loved working with my co-workers.  The lack of good management was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers.
bad,Very demanding mentally. I was required to deal with customers all day and some of them were very rude. In my short time there I had four different bosses so management was always changing. The hours would vary from only four hours one week to thirty-five the following week. They would not tolerate being sick and within my first week I was threatened to be fired because I had to go outside in fear of being sick inside the store. I only had two co-workers that were consistently friendly and courteous with me out of the fifteen or twenty I had in my time there.
bad,Dollar General hires anyone to fill a position this is not the place for some who are looking to grow within the company. Dollar General only concern is the company this is not an career job its an get by day to day establishment.
bad,"The job is easy but the schedules are insecure.  Full time positions are given to managers and supervisors and the cashier positions are part-time.  Management hires too many people which reduces the hours to sometimes 5 hours a week but there's also a high number of people who quit or don't show up, so you get stuck working 2 shifts unexpectedly as well.  The hardest part of the job is that they only have one cashier and a manager working during each shift which is frustrating when it's a busy day and the lines of customers are constantly long.  Constant glitches in the system are frustrating."
bad,"Company and Culture say they care about their people, but keeping the store open at any cost is their primary concern.  I had  less than 9 days off in 6 months and worked over 60 a week every week.  In the last 4 weeks with them I worked with no breaks or rest from open till close. Thats 12 plus hours non stop at a register by myself in the store.  I worked  over 100 hours in one of those weeks. Thats open till close 7 days in a row with no time off."
bad,"I brought a wealth of experience to this job. Told the manager if I could have time, I would clean up the dirty store, but that never happened. When working with a teenager I explained I could get a lot done if they would cover the register. Teen told me she was a manager, but she really wasn't (how could she be). She was a key holder, nothing more. I never got the managers phone number after asking for it. Teenager said to tell her what I wanted the manager to know and she would tell me what the manager's response would be. Never worked anywhere that I did not have my manager's phone number. "
bad,"It's an easy job to do but the management and the co-workers are strictly ""cache group"" where they know each other and one minute will like  you and the next minute back stab you. I wouldn't want anyone working here unless they want nothing but drama."
bad,"Your typical day at work would consist of running the register, assisting customers, stocking shelves, recovering the store, being security depending on area and if your a high shrink store or not ( I was ) bank runs, cleaning of the building and parking lot. Setting planograms, dealing with vendors, and these are just the basics. Because while all the above is going on 9 out of 10 your doing this by yourself due to ""lack of payroll hours"" . I was a high volume store for my area. I was under the impression your store's hours was based on volume but that is not the case. You will be consistently be put in situations that I call a catch 22. You are expected to do and say certain things but if corp was around it's a total different story. Anyone who has been with this company or knows someone who was or is with this company knows sometimes things will not always be able to be gone by the book. You will or you will know someone who will work off the clock to finish their job, you will or will know someone who is working the stocking shift and will get a soda or a drink and pay for it when the store opens vs as soon as they drink it. These things happen due to being concerned about getting the job done as best as possible. "
bad,"The dollar General is a poor company to work for! The managers dont know what they doin and is never there, The upper manager is a joke they only add fuel to the drama. They over work you and expect for you to do ALOT with little pay! People Are ALWAYS STEALING & its sad. Do not work for them"
bad,"Scheduling non consistent, no training, cash drawers were counted by other employees,"
bad,Although managers were laid back. Procedures were not followed and in the end I was incorrectly fired.
bad,"as soon as i got to work,the 1st. shift walked out the door even if their job was not done,i was left to finish it along with what i had to do that day..extra work load was always put on the night shift from the day shift"
bad,was a store manager and was fired because I needed 6 weeks of recovery time for much needed surgery and they chose not to wait for me to return due to inventory.
bad,"Stocked Merchandise"
bad,"Management was frequently late for shifts and scheduled me for days that they knew I needed off. Regardless of how accurate my register counts were, there was always an argument regarding accusations of cash shortages.  "
bad,The work itself isn't that bad but you never know what hours you are going to work. You basically have to be prepared to be there for up to 13 hours even though some days you might only work six hours.
bad,"Hours varied depending on my schedule.  I worked mostly on the cash register and also help in stocking shelves or moving them"
bad,I was treated horrible there! I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone thats how bad it was.
bad,This company has too many issues.  They do not allow manager to leave the floor on break.  Therefore by law they are in violation of workers rights for a break.  They do not staff the store properly to accomplish tasks that are required of each shift.  Management encourages staff to clock out even if they are not finished with duties to avoid overtime issues.  Very Bad Regional Management that takes discontinued products to their church to be disbursed to friends and family.  I will NEVER recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,"A typical day at work was like you had to know who was going to be to know how the day was going, because certain people did work when it called for it. The hardest part of the job is getting the truck out with merchandise that could not go out because they did not have the room on the floor for it and items was not swelling as fast. The most enjoyable part is at the end of the day and a few of us would meet for dinner and drinks after work.  Sometimes you loved your job and hated it to because you could not get along with managers that were not doing their job and everyone doing it for them."
bad,Underpaid with no concerns with how many hours you can and are willing to work.
bad,"This is a company that paints a picture that is full of opportunities and chances, Behind the right managment there is but behind the wrong management there is none. I enjoyed interacting with my regular customers and the relationships or repore that i built. Otherwise i was hurt by the manner in which i was treated ."
bad,I learned everything there was to learn including managerial position within the first year.The hardest part of the job would probably be unloading the trucks.
bad,"If you have a good work ethic and care more about your store than anything else you will make it in this company. But, if you have a life and want to be apart of it then you will do poorly."
bad,ALL ways doing payrol cuts and expecting same quility of work
bad,this is a company that it is all about who you know to get ahead.  It is not based on work experience or work ethics 
bad,"The company doesn't care about it's employees in the stores. Store managers are expected to do the work of 5 people. The work load is always getting more added onto it. If the store doesn't get enough payroll for the work the company wants done then the manager has to make up the difference. I had many, many weeks of working 70+ hours a week. The company doesn't care how many hours you work. District managers are allowed to do whatever they want to whoever they want without anything happening to them. I know of many associates in my districts other stores that complained of harrasement verbal, racial and sexual. They were told to shut their mouth or lose their jobs. When it was reported to the corporate office, they did nothing about it. I wouldn't recomend working here to anybody."
bad,"I liked my managers but I only had one district manager that actually did their job. They cheated me out of pay and vacation days and they wouldn't help me get my vacation, also they fired one of my co-workers because she pointed out she was being sexually harassed by another co-worker but not the guy who she proved was doing the harassing, they only moved him from that store to one across town. aside from that they demand unreasonable productivity and pay as little as possible. I worked both in Killeen ,TX and Lincoln AR"
bad,"clock in, look for equipment to work with, pull rotainers out of back room, put product on sheleves, We are working with latters that are missing rubber tips on the legs, I had the latter go out from under me three times, when asked for new ones, they say they forget to order them, my safety is at risk, I work with good people, we work as a team, I hate to say, but the best part of the job is leaving."
bad,When you work for Dollar general you are expected to work most days open to close they tell you 48 to 52 hours this is not the case at all they do not give the proper payroll for the stores so the store manager fills in the void. was promised one salsry to start and then more in 90 days this never happened.
bad,When I first started there it was a great job and then after about three months on the job the plant manager left and the switched around all the supervisors. After this took place we were always being forced to go well over rate and when you couldnt keep up you would be wrote up or even fired. The supervisors rarely ever told you the honest truth instead they would twist it around with lies.
bad,"After the company went public again it continued to gave us store managers so much paperwork and charts to fill out that our daily tasks suffered. And when all paperwork was finished, new processes came down that rindered to ones just completed, obsolete."
bad,management is terriable. They dont respect hours. Some of the co-workers were nice but not all.
bad,I would say it's a job but not anything that could be a career in the future. Sometimes the schedules changes on a spur of the moment.
bad,"I have learned a lot and have been able to enjoy the customer service part of this job. I enjoy supervising other employees and the task that need to be completed. I open and close the store, make sure all the cash is balanced and make the deposit. I receive inventory, process the paperwork and stock it to the shelf.This company needs to worry more about the safety of its employees, and give the store supervisors more employees to complete the numerous task at hand. Two employees for each shift is not enough to sucessfully have them take pride in what they are ask to do because they are constantly being called off that task and ask to hurry thru projects. I would want to give the customers the best you can be, not second or third best or oh well its OK. They need to have a seperate crew that come in when the store is closed to stock, straighten and clean each store, if not every night a couple of times per week would be suffient."
bad,good place to work if you really have no responsiblities not a full time employer
bad,Dollar general is a good job for someone in highschool it is difficult to get hours and the people steal a lot they don’t hire security and it was just a horrible experience
bad,"Live and breathe DG, this job isn't for you. DG is a tough task master that doesn't give a hoot about work life balance or anything else. I work there as a SM and was working 100 hrs a week"
bad,they cheat part time workers out of overtime and offer no benefits. no advancement. and will terminate for no reason. give false sales numbers. and blame part time employees for all the companies short comings.
bad,The job is lowly and menial work harder faster and unsafe often working hours alone! The opportunities offered to you are slow to the light the stores require constant resets. Your safety is not a company concern ppl rob these stores regularly.
bad,There is a limited few I work with that I can trust and like working with but that’s it. My manager gives me tasks that I can’t not complete in the timeframe required and then gets mad about not completing them.
bad,"I worked here for a month. No proper training, store was a wreck. No one followed policy. Yeah they pay good, you just gotta work yourself to death. I wouldn’t recommend!!! I didn’t receive any help, until I put in my 2 weeks! The store was suppose to be customer ready and wasn’t. 6 months of truck in the back room, no team, no recovery, skyshelves were a mess and dangerous. Dm tried to blame me for store conditions, instead of taking responsibility for it!"
bad,"Dollar General only cares about their bottom line. The work environment is chaotic, inefficient, understaffed and totally UNSAFE. This is by far, the WORST company I've had the misfortune of working for."
bad,"I was an operations supervisor at the Dollar General distribution center in Scottsville, Kentucky  for 3 years.  The demands of the sorting center and the amount of turnover made the role basically impossible to enjoy.  I was recruited from another DC at a competitor and making that transition is something I would not wish on anyone."
bad,"They are good if you need SOMETHING. That is it. Management is uninvolved, constantly ethics violations. Poor scheduling for associates, lacks tools for success. Poor training for management. Overall. Sucks."
bad,A company that does not care about their employees. They are always cutting hours on their employees and it’s never for the better. Lack of leadership in the management and consistently changing it’s rules and regulations to accommodate their own agendas. I would highly suggest working somewhere else
bad,"No caring for the management and employees, gave you unattainable goals then threaten you . Do not care at all for employees.  When your do your job they just want more."
bad,"SM for one year. 70-90 hours a week yes for a year. Used vacation time to make payroll in order to not overland payroll budget in order to set mag on time with trucks and seasonal sets. "
bad,"Unless you’re a manager you get like 2 days a week at $8.00 an hour. And it’s weekly pay, so it’s not much to live off of especially for a mother. How the heck am I supposed to feed a baby with $34 checks?"
bad,Absolutely zero work life balance. Pay is decent until you work 10-20 days straight and 60+ hours a week. Upper management is clueless. Just stay away.
bad,"I can only tell you that this company wants Freight people not leaders. Limited hours are an understatement and solo coverage is a normal practice. Company will always say schedule to the business need but only within a limited budget. Be prepared to be given task meant for three people and expected to be finished in half a shift by yourself. "
bad,Made enough money to get by.They really had a manager who really hated blacks so he make sure he gave them less days to work.When you did go to work he want to put up all the grocery.
bad,Great workers love the employees and the customers. Not the management or dm managers. Not a place to build a career at. Take advantage of people. Plus the pay is not great more work than pay.
bad,Not a job for someone with a family and bills. Don't want you to get 40 hours an you have to do the majority of the work. Only want two people working an expect everything to get done. As well as keep the lines moving along as quickly as possible.
bad,"If your looking to be a manager, plan on giving your home life away.  There is no work life balance.  Company expects to much from you and does little to help."
bad,How much you enjoy your job at DG is entirely dependent on how reasonable of a manager you have and how nice the customers are.  In most cases neither of which will be in your favor.
bad,"It’s any alright job I think they need more then two employees working at a time they expect you to work to hard and they not paying fair enough, I was told to run the cash register and stock the shelves. Kept a long line of people because I be in the back stocking shelves it ain’t like they had a bell or anything"
bad,It was a whole mess. They hire anyone  and best part Management is terrible  they dont do nothing. Dont let them send you to other store they steal time.
bad,Excellent performance achieved results over a year .  Continue d to out perform the companies expectations. The company review process doesn't necessarily follow achieved metrics.
bad,They need to stop treating there employees like slaves. Loss prevention treats employees like criminals. I liked job till they were always short staffed people wouldnt take job serious because the pay wage is not enough to raise a family or pay bills. I covered so many employees hours shifts from lack of caring by the staff itself my boss was great but hands were tied because our DM waswas a jerk.alwalaxythrowing around orders
bad,This company is probably THE WORST company to work for. They underpay their staff by gross amounts and has no good internal structure to help employees log all of their time they actually work into a computer. Breaks don't mean anything if you're a Keyholder+ because the store usually only has one and a regular associate. Managers also suffer because corporate WILL NOT spend any extra money for labor.
bad,Working at dollar general is fun if you make it fun for yourself overall I just love interacting with other customers and helping people because that’s what I love to do.
bad,I had 3 different managers while working there all completely unfit for the job. The lack of real leadership caused a rift in the workers and Management
bad,They truly only cared for themselves and not their employees. If something went wrong the employees are the first to be blamed and punished. The manager gave me a list of things i had to follow (if I didn’t i would be fired) but they didn’t even follow it. I found myself constantly cleaning up after the managers in the break room and around the registers
bad,I’ve been at this job almost 2 years and I’ve been through at least 6 supervisors and the one I have now is the worst of the worst. She is terrible. She is not professional. She don’t keep your personal business confidential. She talks about her employees to other employees and managers. She don’t help when you need her help. I’m at a point where if any job call to offer me a position I’ll take it no matter the pay.
bad,Production is unrealistic and very difficult to achieve. You can and will get constant write ups for production and many other ridiculous reasons. The managers contradict each other quite often. They change the rules of  certain departments almost weekly. Expect termination right when you're eligible for benefits. Low morale.
bad,"I worked there for 6 months,  decided to transfer to another state.  They cut my hours to less than half because the employees at the new store did not make as much per hour as I did.  I would have had to stay for 6 months with 20 or less hours per week.  You can't live on 20 or less hours."
bad,Was pushed into a key holder spot with no training. Was written up for not doing a job that you have no clue about. District Manager is useless. Mangers sit and talk about the employees and customers all the time. And they lie about thing's all time. Coal Hill needs better manager's all the way around.
bad,"There is no work/life balance. You start at 5 am, and are supposed to get off at 1:30 pm, but you never get off at 1:30 pm. As a matter of fact, you never know from day to day when you are going to get off. You might get off at 3 pm or you might get off at 3:30 or it might be 5 pm... you stay until they tell you that you can go. This happens Mon-Fri 5 days a week all year long. Most of the time you get weekends off as a picker, not a driver. But, the couple days you get off for weekends doesn't do much in the way of helping you recuperate from 50+ hrs a week, every week of the year. It's heavy lifting. You are lifting cases of laundry detergent, cases of canned goods,  and two liters and bleach repeatedly or 32 and 24 pks of water or dog food repeatedly all day in 100 degrees through the summer. If you hurt your back or wrist doing this, which is likely because of the racks they want you to pick from, they will not be nice to you about it. You are expected to keep over 95% production rate a week,, if you fall under this one week you are written up. So, people get written up all the time because, honestly, it's hard maintaining 95% working 10 to 12 hrs a day every day of the week.. You cannot have an off week.. You cannot tell them you were sick, but still came to work and got a 94%, because they don't care, they will still write you up. I've seen it happen many times. I've never in the history of my being employed seen a company care less about their employees as I witnessed at the Dollar General warehouse in Scottsville. Management absolutely does not care about the employees"
bad,"I loved my job at Dollar General at first, I started out as a part time cashier, then moved up to a full time key, then to assistant manager and was told I was going to take over the store as manager, then someone else showed up and took over the store, when I got pregnant, all was fine until I was told by my dr that I could not lift more than a gallon of milk, from then on all went down hill, up until the night I was told I had tostock"
bad,Every week you can expect hours to be cut. As less hours are given they expect the salaried SM to cover. Expect being alone in the store for many hours a day and expect zero days off because your DM will call and text you nonstop on your 1 day off a week and demand replies.
bad,"Store manager for five years, still employed but will find another job soon. No support from my DM or from my RM. One of the lowest paying companies around for cashiers and so we get the lowest people around. Dollar General stopped drug testing, then we got the low of the low applying. Many other things I'd like to add on but won't professionally."
bad,"It is very easy to get on at DG as long as you can pass the background check. However, the amount of work they require you to do is completely insane. As a shift manager you have the task of working on assign projects, running the register as backup, and being called to the front of the store every time there is a void, refund, price modification, or transaction cancellation, as well as stocking the weekly truck. This will keep you running back and forth around the store. This register duty even has to be done while you are on ""break"". In truth you don't really get breaks because you can be paged to the front of the store at any given moment, this seems to always happen while I'm eating during my break."
bad,I was overwhelmed and I was over worked. My new manager brought her own team in and tried to weed out the employees that have worked st the store for over two years.
bad,"Only one person in front. Responsible for customers, cleaning and stocking while manager sat in the back. Dirty store but no time to thoroughly clean. Bad experience all around!"
bad,Worked here for about a year and the manager was one of the worst people i had ever worked for. She definetly had her favorite employees. the district manager never cared enopugh about his stores to even do anything about the manger who didnt care. so i did overall quit.
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for many years.  In that time I lost count of how many people I saw come and go.  It is run like a meat grinder, with people ground down until they can't deal with it anymore.  I only made it as long as I did because I kept my head down and was just working it as a side-job whilst going to college.  The pay is a pittance, the company's upper management seems to have an active disdain for store-level employees, and it's an open secret that you will never make it to the corporate level.  Only work for them if your children are starving."
bad,"Dollar General is one of the worst companies to work for. They don’t Care about their employees and run their managers on awful payroll. Glad for the opportunity to learn to be a leader, but it was trial by fire and acid. I can’t believe a company that operates this way can be so successful."
bad,"They had so many crazy thieves, robbers held you at gunpoint in this particular neighborhood where I'd work. It's been like 10 years but I do still shop there. Not that one but Dollar General it self"
bad,"This is not a job I would ever recommend. The pay was not worth it when you average 40-50 hours a week with an $8/hr salary. No benefits, no paid time off, harassment by district managers."
bad,The winter springs fl dollar general is highly unorganized and the management is terrible the store never has a set schedule and recently they've given me no hours this week managers response being (I couldn't fit you in) our manager was gone from a work related injury when I was first hired and until she came back to work both the assistant managers had a terrible attitude towards me and other employees also customers I've recently been harassed by my assistant manager
bad,"It's ok for a starting job such as after high school, but i otherwise would strongly advise to seek employment elsewhere because there are zero employee benefits and no room for advancement at all."
bad,This is a bad company over worked under paid. Will tell you to work 48 hours and 5 days + a half day its a lie. Its 7 days and you be lucky to work 14 hours a day. Hours given is a joke not enough to cover and when they give your employees a pay increase hours drop down even more. District Managers are a joke never come by cheapskates
bad,The company doesn't send any one to the store to get the product sales and the stores get way to much stock shipments and you won't have any body to work it. Budgets are very low in the store.
bad,I worked for this company for 4 yrs. I was the asm. We all worked our butts off for zero appreciation  I always came to work rarely called in  we were all like a family in our store. We worked very well together  we all hunting out outside of work but apparently that is not allowed with dollar general  their is no fraternizing with fellow employees outside of work. Myself and my store manager we're terminate for being friends outside of work
bad,My time was alright at Dollar General except for dealing with the store manager who was the reason I quit my job. The woman was insufferable and I am much happier now without the hassle.
bad,"I loved my position at this job, but the upper management had different ideas for me, they arent fair in some ways and they get by with ""doing and saying what they want"""
bad,Upper management does not help as promised. Mentality of if you won't do it I'll find someone who will. No home life at all. Your accomplishments are not recognized
bad,"Employees are on their phone while ""helping"" customers, employees refused to assist certain customers, manager didn't issue disciplinary actions, the employees were catty and would gossip like they were in middle school (even the old lady). The environment was toxic, and if you're a hard worker, you'll be doing everything alone."
bad,"Company only cares about profits. Any complaint is used against employees, didn't matter if you were following guidelines. Store, district, regional, and VPs would change polices randomly and not pass information down to store level"
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. I had a great staff. I was a store manager. District manager was awful and never showed up, helped, or answered phone calls. I saw so much that one day I will write a book. You can get a job anywhere better than DG. They don’t care about you."
bad,"Don’t get me wrong I loved the people I worked & my customers except for the upper management. It’s always drama for no kind of reason. Then the store manager wants to come in early to do unnecessary tasks. I barely have enough time to try to recover the store. Then If things don’t go their way they would write up. Then I’ve always come in for everyone but, when it comes to a death in my family or me being sick no one wants to come in for me but, add hours into my schedule. It’s definitely not the worth my time. I don’t recommend anyone for this company."
bad,"Outside of store manager, I work with awesome people but time to move on. I am great at what I do and one rotten apple spoils everything else. Employees get sick and a store manager has to understand that, not retaliate!!"
bad,This company is very stressful to work for as a manager because it is hard to keep employees due to the fact that they are under paid and very over worked you will never have a life working here as a store manager you may only get 1 day off a week if that.
bad,"They hire you promising the hours you want but then after 2-3 weeks they drop you back to less then 15 hours a week. They expect you to run a cash register AND clean and stock but there is never a break from the register so you never get your other work done so you get in trouble. Can never find a key holder or manager when you need one. Also expect workers to unload the trucks."
bad,"This job was awful at best but I was making due until I lost the job because the schedule was not effectively communicated to me. I would be told to go do the harder tasks while managers/ key holders would cash people, even though I was told I would be mainly a cashier when I was hired. The workload is far harder than you would expect at a minimum wage job"
bad,Dollar general was a filler job. I needed a job and I was able to get because they where so under staffed. There schedules where wack. They would have a manager and me running the whole store it was bad. Between running the cash register and trying to stock the whole store at the same time was next to impossible but I made it work.
bad,"I did not have to do an official interview the store manager knew me from a previous job. I was hired as an assistant but key carriers did the same things that I did so, I don't know why they have that position. Open , close store count safe and registers prepare deposit tale deposit to bank. Run freight set planograms endcaps price changes clean and zone store. Alone until late in day.  and run registers."
bad,There was always promises for advances but where always over looked and you would ask for time off in advance and never get it off it took a lot of work to continue stocking there as theres always a weekly truck they didnt care if your back room was full they put in all the rolltainer that they had to
bad,"The higher ups don't care about anyone in the stores.  They don't care if you're sick, have a child going through a rough time, a death in the family, they just don't care.  They push process, process, process, but then don't give you the hours to get and stay in process. You're in the store alone 75-80% of the time and they wonder why things don't get done."
bad,"The store is too small, it's difficult to clean, we constantly have overstock. The manager albeit seems nice, is a horrible coworker. She takes credit for things she never did, ruins store stock, and doesn't follow the rules when it inconveniences her."
bad,"The store I was at was crowded with merchandise, it was dirty, they didn't have enough workers, and the pay is horrible. It used to make me feel embarrassed when customers would come in and say OMG the store is atrocious and I would try my hardest to keep the store clean but there wasn't much I could do. I was barely trained I mainly had to learn on my own."
bad,Dollar General's managers should be required to have Some college behind them.  Store managers at a minimum should have to take an IQ test and meet a requirement.  Also the manager should be a people person and not have a temper. The manager should be an example of what to do NOT an example of what not to do.
bad,"With a business that is required to be open with 2 employees at all times from 8am until 10pm and only given 120 hours budget in a work week, with running the register(s), stocking the shelves and all of the other added responsibilities it was very stressful and required to work more hours than the schedule requirement of 48 per week."
bad,The work life balance sucks here and on top of that they say 4 10 hour shifts but it’s more like 4 whatever time we finish and overtime Friday on average 8 hours
bad,Good pay but management of horrible communication is poor do not take employees life and work balance in consideration the work is production base and is push on you after probation period quickly long hours very dishonest in interview process
bad,The job is much too hard and stressful for what they pay. Your expectations are extremely high. Management doesn't listen to the issues that you bring to them. Incentive pay is not attainable when the operation doesn't run the way it is designed to.
bad,"NEVER have the right amount of people at the peak times. The manager would rather have 3 people working when they are there than have enough coverage at the right times to focus on customer service. The schedules are ""pre-done"" by corporate HOWEVER there are hours that can be adjusted by the SM. It is VERY difficult for those that truly want to work and those(including management) that want to barely skate by doing just enough to earn a check & eat the time clock"
bad,"Dollar General is very unorganized. They will hire anyone. Manager and employees were very unprofessional. Never got paid for my time off. Dollar General is supposed to have a dress code people wore what they wanted. Not enough pay, very stressful environment. You cannot pay me enough money to go back to that company."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you want to be treated right. They change the rules every day. And if there is something to your benefit they don't tell you, you find out through other employees accidentally. Not a good work-life balance."
bad,"Insensitive managers. I missed Dr. appointments. Was told my drawer was always short . That was a lie. They leave you at the register and don't come when called to the front. You have to leave your register to find them. They attack people. Make them do more work then the rest of the employees. I wouldn't recommend working there in Saint Charles, Mo."
bad,Long hours never enough staff poor attitude from management unorganized low pay for expectation I will never work for this company again unless I have no other option to support my family..
bad,It was very simple and casual. It wasn’t hard at all and even learned new skills while working there. Thank you for the opportunity and time was well spent.
bad,"There are almost never enough staff to adequately take care of customers and monitor shoplifting and the stores tend to stay dirty and poorly stocked as a result. Often, the entire store is being run by two people. One in management and one employee. They don’t reward you for the extra work and stress either. I made $11 an hour as an assistant manager and you can easily get that as a regular employee at Walmart. Upper management will still expect it to look like a model store while denying any request for more hours, better equipment, etc."
bad,"RUUUUNNN!!! It was THE worst employment experience that I have EVER encountered. The manager definitely had some mental issues, I actually feel bad for the employees I left behind. You would think that with the high turnover this location has, corporate would look at the store leader. Instead, it’s all overseen.....like I said run, run as far away from DG as you can!!!"
bad,The management was terrible the schedule changed so much and the people I worked with were ok. It was stressful trying to work out hours because there was never a set amount you would get each week one week would be 30 to 40 and then the next could be 10 or 15.
bad,"Constantly accused of things, no training, no help, I wouldn't wish this job on anyone. I worked open to close forever...nobody cared nobody wanted to help and district manager was rude as heck"
bad,"As a keyholder, I've had the responsibility of the ENTIRE store dumped into my lap while only receiving 1/4 of the pay raise I was promised. The manager schedules himself ten hours a day, effectively destroying any chance for anyone to work a full 40 every week, but then leaves 3-5 hours into his shift having done nothing."
bad,"The job is very much manual labor. Basic sales associate responsibilities include stock, recovery, cleaning all while maintaining the register. Store managers are expected to work 50+ hours doing mostly hourly employee jobs."
bad,"I would strongly dissuade anyone from applying to this company. By nature, retail is a bare bones situation. Getting the most done with the least overhead. My particular store expected the whole store to be maintained on a daily basis by no more than 3 people, including management. Very seldom was any task completed in an allotted time frame."
bad,Just people using other people to work for them and is just not a good place no over time is just stress full place. I think is a sad place people need to be treated better
bad,"T hey use there managers"
bad,"I've been in retail over 30 yrs having been a General Manager, District Auditor, Regional Auditor, District Manager for 3 different national chains, and self employed with my own store. I've NEVER seen the workload that they put on their store manager for such measly pay. DM was about senile and couldn't remember what he said in one conversation to the next. I stopped counting hours I worked at 70. Anyone who works at the store level has my sympathy."
bad,It honestly a place where you want a second job and you make a little extra money there hours are really bad and the pay is as bad as the hours I would tell anyone to work there to be honest
bad,"This is not the place you want to work for. Poor management skills. Internal theft from members of management. Even if you work more than 40 hours, you don't get overtime because they just go in and change your hours. Expect to be available 24/7 for the store as you likely won't work your actual scheduled shift. Unrealistic work load. Cashier's do everything. Unhappy customers due to a lack of employees on a register. I could go on. Just don't work here. It's not worth it"
bad,"As a Store Manager you're way over worked for the budget you're given every week for scheduling. I was working 60-70 work weeks because everyone else could only work 30-34 because of the budget. You're required to work a minimum of 48 hours a week, 5.5 days. 1 day off off. Never days off back to back."
bad,There is not a work/life balance to be had and corporate could care less!!! The pay is great for store managers but you have to work like a slave get it.  So not worth the headache!!!
bad,Company didn’t seem to care how many hours a manager worked. Too hard to find competent employees.  Company didn’t care about getting decent help and would just send more and more product without regards to sales.
bad,I would never work for this company again in my life. You run the store 40% of the time with one employee long lines lots of work very low pay worst job I ever worked for
bad,I would not recommend working at the store I am currently employed at. The employees who have been there a number of years tend to let some of their assigned tasks fall to the next person who comes in.
bad,"What can you expect from a min wage employer? You clean, do register get paid like garbage, no breaks other than lunch and only get at best 25 hours a week."
bad,"We have the worst management.   lazy, sloppy, unkept, with no clue how to manage.   Rude to customers and employees. Hours are terrible and wages are low. I love this job other than her and the hours.  Our turnover is terrible because of them and this is a new store which is very busy.   This would be a great job if we had a competent manager that understood how to mange a business.  I am trying to transfer to another store.  There ARE good managers at other stores...."
bad,"No managerial support, on any level. Hostile, sexist, and discriminating. Hard workers get left behind or even fired for doing their bosses job and their own, no recognition of any kind, and not to mention an unsafe environment for the customers and employees, i.e. for over a year now I have constantly seen customers trip at the front door because there is a half inch drop where a floor matt should be, bathrooms are always filthy and there is always water on the floors. If you ask for help to open another register, your given attitude."
bad,Manager favored certain people over others. Would be very lax with certain employees and strict with others. ex. phones were not allowed some people had them out and they would not get talked to.
bad,"When I started, I liked my job. Now I'm looking to do something different. Never work for a company where hard working employees are overlooked and treated poorly"
bad,"Great place to work for a first job. Management was a joke and you aren’t really paid for the extra work you do. Due to jealousy,I lost my job and is non eligible for rehire."
bad,"I loved working for Dollar general at first. After I transfered to a different store. When I transfered to glassboro it was great. The other employees were super nice. Management was great, until the store manager started slacking off at work and making the employees pick up his slack but he still got credit for it."
bad,"The first 2 weeks are your training as a store manager. The first week, you go to a training store location and train alongside another Store Manager. Then during the 2nd week, that same store manager you trained with is supposed to come to the store you are being assigned to and help get you acclimated and started. During my first week, the training manager neglected to brief me on A LOT of pertinent information, such as the required, assigned tasks from corporate that each store is supposed to complete by specific deadlines. I primarily felt like I was a backup cashier and/or stocker for her store, not as being trained to become a Store Manager. Furthermore, during the 2nd week of training, that same store manager only came to my store ONCE! Keep in mind, managers are required to work 5 and a half days each week... Although set up for failure, I persevered and through dedication of my own personal time I was able to self-educate myself about the position of Store Manager per Dollar General's SOP. I willingly worked 70 to 80 hour workweeks in order to help bring this broken store up to par. However, rather than standing alongside their managers, it seems Dollar General is not only willing unappreciative of the hard work and dedication they recieve from their store managers, but they also will NOT stand by them, REGARDLESS of the given situation. I began with the company excited, motivated, and pumped. By the time I left here, I was extremely burnt out and frustrated."
bad,Not the best place to work. They really don't appreciate their employees. You are overworked and underpaid. The only good thing I could say is the weekly pay was good but working here will make your hair fall out and it's not worth the stress.
bad,With the exception of very few supervisors the overall management is worse than you can imagine. I was more than qualified to come in as a supervisor but they refused to check my credentials. Supervisors are do as i say not as i do. Managers are even worse. All you are at the warehouse is a number. If you like being a human being do not apply for this place.
bad,"Horrible management, they never help solve issue they like to talk I to any type of way. Want you to do all the work if your a hard working employee. Don’t waste time here there no advancement or raise one manager get paid less than what she suppose to get but she doesn’t know that."
bad,Manager was horrible and a racist at crosby tx store 1807. If one person doesnt like you they will find any little thing to fire you. They are selfish with hours and knowledge.
bad,I was a key holder dating another key holder. Store manager knew and would tell other people. They promoted me to Assistant Store Manager knowing the whole time we were dating. Only when I had a complaint about having to call the police on a customer threatening my life and nothing being done about it did us dating become an issue. They transferred me after she gave both of us vacation time together. That's when they started coming down on me. Cut me from 37hrs a week to 11 hrs. After I got my hrs back they started giving me ridiculous task.. ie.. go outside and clean the bird doo off the cement. Then I got pregnant. I had lifting lb restrictions and could not climb the ladder. All of a sudden i had more work to do more lifting more stocking and would get threatened to get written up. I was even told if i couldn't do it to stay home. They tried putting me on non paid leave like if i asked corporate which i hadn't. When that didn't work they found any reason. I got sick one shift and was throwing up outside. There was a key holder inside and another worker. I let them know I was not feeling good. I clocked out for lunch they checked on me outside but yet i was fired for leaving my job and supposedly leaving a worker by themselves which is bull cause there was two. They said they couldn't find me which is bull cause one of them went outside to get the store phone from me and my car was parked in front of the store. I didn't even get unemployment because of their added lies. They got rid of dead weight.. In other words they didn't like me having restrictions. I still busted my
bad,"Never time for personal time and going on Matrix was hard to come back... They misplace faxed papers ,don't return calls ,like to micro manage and not see reality of the customers point of view"
bad,"If you value your marriage,home life and health, stay away from this bottom-feeder of a company.ALL of the work is on the store manager and paying us a salary meant you can be worked like a sleigh dog without a vacation for 2.5 years.I have absolutely nothing good to say about the company's infrastucture or it's values, they don't exist.I did learn how to run a store on limited hours though.Other than that, Dollar General is ok IF you want to live for them.NEVER EVER will I suggest to ANYONE to work there, not even to my worst enemy( well, maybe my enemy)"
bad,"Poor to moderate Management, high turnover rate, inconsistent hours, only offered me health care because I work over 30hrs average but it cost half of what I made in a month so I declined it, no other benefits offered to me. Company has unrealistic standards, little to no raises, no respect or consideration for its employees; avoid at all costs."
bad,Dollar General asked to much out of managers we run freight run cash registers orders payroll paperwork plantagrams set seasonal sweep mop clean recovery just a lot on a manager
bad,Do not waste your time here. One quarter  above minimum wage is not worth losing your livelihood over! Management likes to only criticize employees and then stress out all other employees because one or two people are bad at their job. You will get blamed for something you did not do if upper management finds something he does not like about you outwardly! This job was a class A joke!
bad,"robbery and theft is extremely high here. the company doesn't care about their workers health, safety or anything else in that manner. the managers were extremely stressed out all the time."
bad,"Run for the hills and hide.  This company while rapidly growing in size is failing on how it treats their field leaders.   Lies, lack of support, unprofessional and overworked."
bad,Within my five months there I saw more than 10 employees including 3 managers come and go. I was forced to take a promotion and fired over the phone because I was not trained properly. Corporate HR department gave me attitude and never resolved my wrongful termination.
bad,Working for Dollar General was not a great experience. Hardly paid for the amount of work expected. Hours are very low and they hire more people to drive hours even lower.
bad,If you enjoy long hours without overtime and low pay this company is for you they  do not pay their female employees that are in the management position the same as male employees they expect you to work long hours for salary and minimal payroll dollars or hours to run a busy store and to be able to get bonuses is almost impossible it’s hard to find people to work at only 20 hours a week most people are looking for full-time positions not part time and when you hire part-time positions at 20 hours a week they are expecting them to have Completely open availability instead of hiring people they can work certain shifts that will always be there and working with people schedules they expect everyone to have open availability and work all hours
bad,"This job made me miserable. Maybe I just had a terrible management team, but I absolutely hated my job. This is such a stressful job to work for. Sometimes I had to work for more than 12 days straight, our store was never supplied with enough hours, the store is IMPOSSIBLE to keep clean. Customers can be awful, but honestly the customers weren't even the reason I hated my job. I definitely made friends with some of my regulars, if anything, some of the customers made my day go by a little nicer."
bad,"The company expects the stores to be run with minimal staff. They do not pay a decent wage for the amount of work that is expected. The company only seems concerned with making money, not with being a good employer. They take and take, but don't give back."
bad,"Only ever had one register open at a time and you are not allowed to stand at the register when no customer is present. You have to sweep/mop, help customers reach high shelves and find products, stock shelves, collect carts from both within the store and out in the parking lot, and ensure the doors and windows remained clean all on your own without supervision or assistance. Had no idea what the managers do all day since I never saw them during work hours with the exception of rare occasions. Having to constantly log off the register to go put a single item on a shelf, just to rush back and log in before the next customer approaches is tiresome and stressful, especially when you get in trouble for not having everything done by the end of the day (even if you only work a 4hr shift). The line at the register frequently ran all the way to the back of the store and managers never had any sense of urgency."
bad,"You are considered an asset before anything else and even then you're a hole in corporate's pocket. The cameras watch you, not customers. Shoplifting goes unpunished because it is a tax write off. Everyone I worked with was great except the manager. He always put his work off on the assistants while he flirted with female employees."
bad,"I was there hardest worker, the Manager is childish & loves to be 2faced behind everyones back. Never got. Recognized for the greatness i did at this job. Customers loved me & i lovee them back. Dollar general corp works you like a slave & if you allow them to the push over on you."
bad,There was not enough and to much testing it seemed they just wanted to use me they didn’t have any hours and then just to much testing it was unreal to me
bad,I was excited about working at Dollar general until I found out that 99% of the workers were female an we had to do all the real heavy lifting. The pace was nice an all but having just two workers in the store at all times made us easy targets for theft an robbery. And it was only one cashier an one manager at all times making it hard sometimes for the manager to get things done due to long lines an needing to help on the register.
bad,"You are over worked and underpaid, with a high expectation of what needs to get done, all while being understaffed. You get forced to work whatever shift you are given. Management can take 8 smoke breaks and give you 1 (if you’re lucky). They will leave you on a register by yourself in rush times to go on break. Lines of 10+ people have occurred too many times to count. I have nothing good to say about this company. They burn out everything you have and expect you to still give."
bad,They can do better. There is definitely more room for improvement. They don't care for their employees. There's no promotion. Employees are not given enough hours. The pay is so low.
bad,"My time working for dollar general s*cked. I loved my job at first but once I came into management I slowly found out how r*tarded the manager is. There was not no OUR store it was always about MY store. I noticed the manager was not following the SOP and everytime I would question her about her managing ways she would get mad and act immature.  She did not follow SOP, she runs the store the way she wants and doesn't care what the DM or RM say. total nut job best thing to happen to be was getting fired. saved me from committing $uicide"
bad,"When i worked at dollar general warehouse i loaded and unloaded,and dealt with electric pallet jackets.I was a very quici was willing to work overtime and all.k learner,"
bad,The managers have changed since I've worked here but i'd be cautious. Surrounding Dollar Generals have better managers and customers. The manager that I was under was horrible and cruel.
bad,The particular store I worked at the store manager had her favorites and I was working all the time to get all the freight out and she never put any out she put her self on register instead. I have been a store manager before.
bad,Wasn't giving the help needed. No raises were given. Peoe were very slow in returning phone calls or text. Didn't give proper training for the job at hand.
bad,My manager was very inappropriate and very rude to his employees. I was yelled at for little things and had barely any hours at the store I was working at.
bad,At first when the store first opened it was fun and productive but after they let go of the manager it got very relaxed unproductive nobody wanted to do anything that wasn't on their job description. It got worse when the male mangers came in the store became dirty stocking items was not their priority. It just became a place you wouldn't want to work at.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work! After working for two years I make 8.75 per hr. I asked for a raise thru what they like to call the open door policy. The open door was met with no one is home; they will not even answer a request for a raise. The only raise you will see is 25cents per year. They expect you to be grateful for this but we all consider it to be a slap in our face. "
bad,Got a new manager who had never been a manager before. She promised me the assistant manager position and ended up offering it to her friend who had applyed. I knew more then both combined. I also worked more and offered to stay later or worked double shifts. Also i could never live on paychecks week to week. I worked alot and my checks never showed.
bad,"Dollar General is not a place for African American females above the Store Manager level. These females hardy exist in top positions in the field or at corporate. These females are terminated for reasons no other group at Dollar General is terminated for, especially District Managers.  Diversity and Inclusion do not exist."
bad,"The management at the moment was awful."
bad,From the manager to corporate level they didn't seem to know what they were doing. Very disorganized. What they expected of you was not reasonable in the time allotted. They paid basically minimum wage.
bad,They expect you to work 6 days a week and at minimum 48 hours. Never have any time for family or time to relax. If you need more then 1 day off and dont have any vacation time you are not allowed to take it.
bad,-stressful
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for about 2 years. I wouldn't recommend unless you're in desperate need of a job. The pay is low. The job itself isn't that difficult but dealing with rude customers all day can be quite exhausting. I had a rude boss which made working for Dollar General more difficult. Overall, I wouldn't really suggest working there mostly due to low pay."
bad,Worst place to work at if you are in management. The demand is high and the help is minimal. Your outside life is nonexistent. Work and sleep is all you get. Can't stand Dollar General with a passion.
bad,"Not enough labor to accomplish the bare minimum let alone extra.  The managers in high regard all work well over 60 hours a week, unending, indefinitely...."
bad,"The employees are nice, but the hours are too inconsistent. I have been working with them for 2 years while others employees left i stayed and helped it stay afloat, but now my hours have gone down the drain. I went from working 30 hours a week to 4. The hardest part of the job is that i'm the cashier, but i also stock, and clean, and assist customers. They expect us to get 1 roltainer of product done an hour. So when i don't because unlike everyone else i'm the main cashier I get the talk about productivity. I'm never really on the schedule anymore yet they call me in when no one shows up for their shift. I only got a pay raise from $7.25 to $8 because someone quit and i threatened to."
bad,"This company is by far the worst company I ever worked for. There is no work/home balance. They don't care about the employees the just want to meet quarterly goals. I have never seen a company not able to keep employees, like this company. It's awful!!!"
bad,"I would only recommend here if I had no life to live or to feel exhausted over work my body and just sleep eat and work . Your on a point system when you first start it’s three points . One minute late .5 point break or punch in . Full point if you call in . After three points  before three months your fired. They play favoritisms. HR and managers are buddy buddy . The managers are forced to lie to you  about your hours ,Your on a  percentage  Rate. If you don’t hit that 100 or more you get written up . Stressful basically this generation Slave work . Weekends you have set hours but the week day you get out when they feel like it so don’t make any set plans . Less than 24 hours notice  whether you have to come in after they tell you you don’t .... everyone is s general warehouse so they can put you in any department they feel like they cross train to put you where they please . If your sick you call in your manager holds it against you . Phony fake they say they care and are generous but trust and believe they only care about their money . Bless be better. You don’t deserve this . Turn over rate 90% . Full case 70 something percent alone ."
bad,This job is horrible setting to work in the managers are rude and hateful alot Of drama! Very disappointed. The coworkers talk about eachother. Theres just alot of nonsense
bad,"I was hired as SMC (Store Manager Candidate) and put into a store that was considered a ""challenge store"" as it was a horrible mess. Previous management had let things go so badly that the district manager's ONLY concern was getting the shelves stocked. Unfortunately, the previous manager was allowed to return to the store as an assistant manager after being previously fired & then relocated to another state...this kept the morale so low and there was so much chaos with the constant back-biting, harassment, threats, etc. Rather than deal with the employee issues that were keeping this store down so badly, the district manager pushed extremely hard to do nothing but stock the shelves - absolutely no concern over the threats or the stress that the remaining staff was under. He had no time whatsoever to answer questions that were management or training related & every single time his response was, ""Don't worry about that right now."" He clearly had no idea or concern for what was going on in that store on a daily basis as he was seldom there and when he was, everyone was on their best behavior. The culture is not going to change there until an entirely new crew is put into place and proper training is conducted for absolutely everyone. When I stepped in, no one yet everyone was ""in charge"" - was the craziest thing I've ever seen. I requested a transfer to another store via email and was completely ignored by the DM."
bad,did what i needed to do so i could pat the rent never would i tell some one to apply you wont be able to make it in this world with that pay your kids will starve
bad,"A typical day at work for me as an assistant manager was no different than a regular employee. I learned nothing from Dollar General and the Management lacked personality and necessary skill for their job title. the workplace culture is very fast paced, unorganized and sloppy. The hardest part of the job for me was juggling store cleanliness, unloading truck, answering questions from other employees and making sure everything ran as smoothly as possible, all at the same."
bad,This is a company that will run you into the ground and as soon as you think you might advance throws you away even if you did nothing wrong! They will come up with a reason!!!
bad,The job was horrible management could’ve been a lot better than what it was and they could’ve have given people more time off than what they did and showed more people respect
bad,"Here's the the real scoop on what you will face as a manager. You will be scheduled to open the store on stock delivery day at 5am. You will be scheduled to go home at 2pm but you will end up closing the store when your second key holder calls out sick. That's 5am to 9pm or 10pm during the holiday season. And remember, it takes about 30 minutes to close, and then you have to make your bank drop. Then you can go home.......roughly 17 hours later. Expect your District Manager to offer zero assistance with coverage. It's all on you. This is commonplace. And to add insult to injury, you may be placed in a ""high risk"" location, a blanket term for high crime. Imagine having to leave close your store in the middle of the night in a dilapidated neighborhood where 90% of the exterior lights don't work. Please consider any other company first."
bad,"The company was a good place to work the first 5 years. My last 2 years were horrible. NO benefits and no help from corporate when the store was high volume and understaffed , yet still was top seller in district."
bad,It's a bad place to work wouldn't recommend it to eneyone gives 7.75 a hour only gives 14 hours a week to 21 hours a week I made 10$ at Walmart 40 hours a week for 8 months that's more resondable and management isn't friendly at Dollar general about giving more hours and Dollar general doesn't pay enough hours to have car insurance and gas to even get there .
bad,"I would not recommend nor would I ever do it again.  The pay is low,  the theft is high, the product is cheap, and the employee is undervalued."
bad,"Working at the local Dollar General was a miserable experience that I would not wish upon anyone. You have to be dead and gone to have a proper excuse for this heartless, soulless corporation to let you stay home a day. No matter the circumstances, they will dog you if things aren’t A1 in upper management. I’ve been called so many times by grown women well-above my pay grade, at ungodly hours of the night, trying to bully and harass me into taking extra shifts. In these calls, my work ethic would be called into question if I declined the “offer.” For a store chain with the morbidly shadowed, and almost under-wraps corporate goal of “making the community better,” they obviously don’t have much of a care in the world for the workers that spend long and grueling hours of their time dealing with a horrifically disrespectful customer-base, poor management, and absolutely non-existent training methods, just to make sure the whole ship doesn’t sink. Their operations are vapid beyond comprehension, and they don’t deserve the workers they milk to keep said operations running. Don’t apply; Let Dollar General die."
bad,It very stressful working for Dollar there no work life balance they continue  threat  you about your job it’s to much I wouldn’t tell anyone about this job
bad,I actually liked opening boxes and stocking stuff . It was my favorite thing to do honestly . And showing great customer service skills is key to working there as well.
bad,DG has a mission statement that they do not follow They do not care about the people they work you to death and do not appreciate what you do District Mgrs are just out for themselves and do not care who they step on They lie to make sure they look good and do not care about the fallout from it. If the share holders and upper mgmt really knew what went on in the stores they would be appalled
bad,"This company does not care about the people that work for them. They continue to cut hours for the store and then expect the store to put away incoming freight, do weekly counts for product order, set new aisles for seasonal merchandise, etc. There is usually only one person working from 8am to around 4 depending on where the store is. Then 2 at night for safety reasons. The store manager has to fill all the extra hours because those hours aren't counted in the store budget. The district manager makes promises he can't possibly keep just to keep employees from leaving."
bad,Dollar General does not care about their employees! Store Manager works 50-60 hours a week because they only give the co-managers 30 hours a week. its impossible to make a living at this company. district managers write you up every time they come in to visit the store. i would NOT recommend this company to anyone!
bad,"dollar general only cares about sales. you could work for the company sacrafice your life for this company and they dont care. i started out as cashier part time and now i am full time key, i mainly work nights but i dont ever get to live my life. especially the store i worked at, there was so many call outs no call/no shows, that the manager always called me to cover , now if i called out which within 3yrs ive only called out 3 times, i got punished. its a terrible greedy company."
bad,"Everything at first seemed fine. After a while that changed. The managers started getting more and more unreasonable, Corporate tried to micromanage ever store, and the pay wasn't very good."
bad,"Worked in a pretty shady part of town, as such it's likely some of the employees and management weren't exactly the cream of the crop so I shouldn't have expected as much as I did. But when I was hired on I was told they would be flexible with me over hours and would never make me work more than one night shift a week and only one day a weekend. They let that manager go and despite me signing a contract, the new general manager put me on nothing but weekend/holiday/night shifts. There was an incident where one of the assistant managers took a check from my till and instead of them being fired for it they wrote her up and reprimanded ME for ""allowing"" it to happen. I guess they want me to waste 10-15 minutes at the end of the night making sure the managers they hire actually have morals?"
bad,I was a key holder here and working 7 days a week and getting forced to take 3-4 hour lunches but wasn't allowed to leave store because I was the the MOD and had to work off clock during these lunch time since I was the only manager and had to do voids and give change.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend it to nobody my expectations and experience were awful and I got blame for a lot of things going wrong but I never will want to work there again
bad,"Inconsistent training. No two managers would tell you the same thing as far as what you are allowed to do or how to do anything. While there are plenty of company policies in place regarding every possible situation, they do not follow them. If you are a good worker, you are expected to do everybody else's job on top of yours."
bad,"Can't really say much about it, I wasn't there long enough really. I caught the store manager stealing and she let me go for not following policy and procedures."
bad,"I had 3-4 managers in the 5 years I worked for the company and none of the knew what they were doing. They mentally exhaust the employees making the turnover rate high, the company does not care about employees and managers only ever think about what benefits them."
bad,As a store manager you will pretty much spend every minute of the day working. The pay isn't even worth it when you have to be there every waking moment. District managers expect you to unload trucks and put away freight and run the registers with hardly any help at all
bad,"Dollar General has good training programs, they offer college reimbursement and discount programs. Dollar General offers flexible scheduling for hourly employees. The insurance sucks."
bad,Our manager at the time did not spend time to train anyone which made it harder on her. Employees and managers go quickly at DG because the work is hard and the pay is low. You feel un appreciated and slaved.
bad,"It is a very stressful work environment. The hours are all over the place with no consistency at all. The management is very poor and unorganized. They micromanage every aspect of the job, and have unrealistic expectations for each day. There is no appreciation for anyone's work and they are very unprofessional."
bad,"If you work there be prepared to do everything.  Everyone is expected to cashier, stock, maintain, and exercise theft protection, as in most stores.  Expect to do all these duties simultaneously.  The stores are under-manned with very few hours each week to schedule people to work, usually leaving only a skeleton crew. Overtime is frowned upon. There is high turnover and constant shrinkage. Raises over $.25/hour once a year are rare, and you start at just above minimum wage."
bad,"I think it's fair enough for me to just make things obvious. There's a reason for a high-turnover rate. Management is forced to micromanage everything, if there is an accidental scan the manager must be called over to use a key on the register to take the item off. This causes stress, especially if you have managers who don't want to do their jobs. "
bad,"Worst  company I have never worked for,  Dm would tell the manager something and they say he did when it was told what he said. Dm hardly can to the store"
bad,"Unloaded trucks, stocked, did deposit, cashiered, hired and fired, scheduling."
bad,Management sucks. No labor hpurs to get what needs to be done done. Long hours alot of qork and super stressful. It is always under staffed amd the turnover is very high
bad,"lack of labor hours to get anything done in a timely manner."
bad,I didn’t like working there but how ever dollar general can be a great job to start a career with working . It also depends on the management of the dollar general store
bad,The management for the store and district is terrible. The managers act likw they do not care about you and will do only what is better for themselves
bad,"Made complaints several times due to the ""rough"" location (high theft, uncomfortable environment) they would not move me. The training is very lacking as well."
bad,"I can't speak for Dollar General as a company since I've only ever worked at one location and very briefly, but my experience at the store I work/worked at has been miserable. Corporate gives each store a set amount of hours each week and how the manager assigns the hours to the employees is purely opinionated. As a manager I've gotten zero hours a week before when regular associates who started after me are given more than twenty the same week."
bad,"Backstabbing, no support or backing from the Manager, ordered to work at other stores by the District Manager without asking, heavy work with no assistance, work every weekend and at least 3 nights a week.  Holidays are only given to those that have children or have a personal relationship with the Manager."
bad,"company works with as few employees as they can get away with."
bad,The environment is pretty safe and there is a lot people you can talk to. The work is based on self reliance meaning if you can push it out it will always be there.
bad,My experience at dollar general would have been great. I love the community and the work I did. But the pay was not enough and they don't give you enough staff to work for the week.
bad,Literally does nothing to benefit you in life. You have to beg for raises not matter the amount of time worked for the company. Everyone’s usually all about themselves
bad,"Few employees and if someone is sick, you work sort.  Don't care about workin conditions or if tins are broken.  Potoles in drive and cant lock back door and tey don't care."
bad,"Very boring atmosphere, there was a lot of protocols not followed, the management was poor and the employees never did anything fun, there was no opportunity for advancement"
bad,"Dollar General is a good place to work if you are a teenager who is still in school and needs just enough money to put gas in your car, or need a second job to make a little extra money. "
bad,"I believe this company has a more for less mentality,too much to do and not enough hours allocated to each store to accomplish the goals that corporate desires. The higher management has lost sight of the real problems that are present in the local stores..lack of this has created a high turnover rate of store managers..the pressure to maintain the stores is too high for the hours..ie..a regular store gets 170 hours for a 7 day work week...opening at 8 and closing at 10..with a normal truck delivering 1200 pieces of stock...not enough hours to maintain register help and stocking. I hope that it will change but I do not believe it will..they have forgotten that the retail worker makes the company.."
bad,"Store went under new management and the environment started to drop and no communication with manager. Manager always wanted to argue with someone such as co-worker, customer, or anyone."
bad,"It was an alright job in the beginning, a place I actually felt I could progress. But after one of my managers tried stealing money and blaming me for it, and the other one giving me little to no hours it became clear that this was not a place in which I could progress."
bad,"I'd easily say Dollar Genaral without a decent manager is a dead end job. They pay bare minimum, give no benefits and talks of advancment is just a joke."
bad,"Payroll budget too small to support business needs. Miniscule staffing creates major issues with having a life. Communication is completely absent, many times projects will start without store team even knowing they are going to happen causing massive issues at store level."
bad,"extremely unsafe environment always threatened by people and manager would not give me the hours that I was told I would be getting, always gave part timers more. Absolutely unprofessional district manager that would not help me at all. Terrible company to work for, do not shop or work there."
bad,"Go to the facebook page Dollar General Mayhem for an insight into how this company functions."
bad,Employees loved having the assistant manager title but didn't like to do the work that was required. Lots of gossiping and backstabbing involved on a day to day basis.
bad,"The store was in a bad location and lacked proper security. Corporate made it quite clear, they didn't care. I worked very hard from day one. Earned two raises and one promotion in a year's time. However, when it came time for me to advance further, they hired in other individuals based on specifications I could not meet at that time. When I did, they added a new specification and this went on."
bad,just a bad place to work. workload upserd for one to accomplish and still breath. was thrown under the bus due to the fact i a was the fng. I had to get out
bad,"The store was in disarray. Manager very opinionated not workable conditions , she found fault in every good thin performed. Very jealous of talents,  Not a place of happy workers, down trodden. Customers like me very much and manager was jealous of this,"
bad,"Might be different in different locations. It's disorganized, and poorly managed. If you can avoid it, it would be beneficial. I'm being very cryptic, they wanted this."
bad,overworked underpaid 80 plus work weeks minimal pay injures do not matter lack of leadership from upper management no employee loyalty no upward movement
bad,"I am a former employee of Dollar General. I worked for the company for almost 2 years.  I have always shopped at Dollar General as it is better than fighting the crowds at Walmart. My opinion of the company changed when I started working for them. All of my co-workers said the same thing..... Unrealistic expectations are expected of you. The amount of stocking and other things assigned to you is ridiculous. There is no way it can be completed within the time allotted. On most shifts, I have had to literally run up and down the aisles to get done what was assigned to me. Dollar General could really be a good place to work if not for the demands made by the manager and the company. The amount you get paid is shameful.  The only reason I stayed  is because I needed a job and had kids to feed. Worst job I have ever had! Employees don't even get a discount!"
bad,Working at Dollar General was very difficult. Constantly moving products off and on to different areas. I believe that there must be a better system than what they have. Their was never enough staff to fulfill the requirements.
bad,"Terrible work environment, not enough help, and too many hours for position. I was overworked as a cashier and wasn’t paid fairly at all. Also, the manager was very lazy and lied a lot."
bad,"No respect for employees, they expect to you work alone, wait on the customers and stock the truck and straighten and set up sales all at the same time"
bad,"Not a great company to work for, this company doesn’t care for the people that are working for them and making them rich. We work with no air conditioning,no heat, lying and rude customers, you have no time for your family cause you are at the store all day and night, and also management sucks. NOT A GOOD COMPANY To WORK For AT ALL"
bad,The wages did not support the work hours and other things you have to put up with. The customers are horriblely rude and the management and other key holders are just as bad. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone.
bad,"It would be nice if people who cared worked here, but it is hard to care when you're treated like dirt by employers and customers, and you're trying to hock a bunch of junk that was made in China.  That or Vienna sausages."
bad,The company does not allow enough payroll to successfully operate and maintain a good store. No person should have to sacrifice their family to get the job done.
bad,"Doesn't offer hourly employees enough pay too keep good staff. Alot of open to close work days if someone calls off. The staff you do have, you don't have enough hours to give out, so bare minimum staffing. 6 day mandatory work week."
bad,"The pay is very low and sometimes working conditions are less than desirable. "
bad,this website not giving me a chance to skip rating this stuff I don't want to fill out rating stuff want to just get on with completing my profile on here
bad,There is not enough support from the District Managers for the store managers. Problems are not put through the proper channels to protect the DM and not the SM or store staff. It is all about their bonuses and not the values of the company.
bad,Store #4049 is a deplorable place to work. It is always filthy no matter what. Skeleton crew operations. Zero respect here. Discrimination to the fullest. No one cares about anything here. It’s just there to collect a paycheck. Manager sits in her car most of the time even when there are lines of customers waiting to check out and she is being paged or yelled for. She avoids work or helping anyone. I complained multiple times and nothing was ever done. They simply do not care about their employees or customers. Very pathetic place to work.
bad,"The only really good thing I can say about working there is that you at least have a good idea about working retail from a good month or so working here. No discounts, always on high alert, and a lot of drama in the workplace."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here, they don't pay you enough, when its slow paced it is absolutely nothing to do, manager is horrible and doesn't take care of the store"
bad,"Typical day at work is fine. I was only there 4hrs at a time twice a week. "
bad,The managers are not good women to work with they are not  professional.  The store was hard to work in because of lack of leadership because most of them are related or know each each outside of the work place so there was not any work ethic.
bad,I liked working there in the beginning until people who came in after me started getting promoted and I was constantly overlooked. I worked my days off and whenever one of my co workers didn't want to work their shift and that's the thanks I got. I was hired as a part time worker but I worked a full time shift constantly and every weekend. This company is the worst
bad,Not enough hours for pay bad some store has great customer service representative but  the u have some store have horrible service line be out the door
bad,Never ever ever work at the Dollar General. They only use you when they need you. They’re very very discriminating. Very poor management. They don’t follow rules. They always do things last minute or when needed. They Don’t recognize hard work.
bad,"Overall not a bad place to work, you take the good with the bad where ever you go, but this job is   more for the  younger generation with no experience looking to gain experience and grow off of."
bad,"Workplace was always cluttered due to manager trying to do too many things at once compounded with being severely understaffed. A typical day of work usually consisted of getting there at 0730 to begin opening procedures and be open for business at 0800. I would be the only staff member in the building for hours not being able to do anything, except my duties as a customer service representative. Once the store manager got there, (usually an hour or two late), at sometimes noon or later, would then berate me for not getting any of the cleaning, stocking, or organizing done. The hardest part of my job was trying to get all of the stocking and product rotation done on time. It was such a large store, and with only one or possibly two employees on a good day, it was very difficult to get through the amount of product we had."
bad,It was terrible the manager was a straight jerk about everything wouldn’t let me take a day off for to have any of my surgery’s. Made me come in no matter what even with a note
bad,"Ever wonder why the company is always seeking applicants?  "
bad,"Lack of motivation among co-workers, managers are aggressive, and also a dangerous environment with minimal training. Work/life balance is very one-sided."
bad,They do not honor their family first then work policy. They push the managers to exhaustion and they cut hours not a good company .managers get hurt. Dm picks favorite stores and no matter if you are #1 in the district he harasses the employees. They cut hours just to make managers who are salary work hours for free and help loose good hard working employees due to cut in hours. This is a poor company to work for in this region
bad,"You need to know and value your employees.  Never should anything come out of the mouth of an inexperienced, Sales Associate's, with less than 90 days in the companies, stand for more than what a Store Manager has to say."
bad,"They need more organized, and orderly ways to help work to help with the people that work under the mangers. Things needed to be set for ways we needed to do things."
bad,Working was always stressful.  Always behind with all the work we are ask to do. Do not get  breaks or help with assignments. Ask to work extra not paid right for it. If you worked 54 hours that week you should be paid correctly. Not forty this week and 14 on the next weeks check. I was cheated out of a couple hundred dollars during the Christmas holiday
bad,They promise the moon and lie at every turn. The worst district manager ever. I tougher it out for one year expecting things to come true I was promised and it never happened.
bad,"Loved working at family, wearing the uniform all day, learing to workin as a team player but I did it all by myself most of the time, management of not fair but manage to work for the company."
bad,"Honestly any company that starts you and says you only get 4 days of training as a manager is a huge red flag. It immediately displays there is zero concern for someones personal development. If you have advanced retail experience this will not be a good fit. There is no in stock/receiving the managers are primary responsible for this job often neglecting the store for most of their shift.  Staffing is the worst i have ever seen in 16 years of work experience bare bone staffing like a single cashier and a single manager most days leads to  a plethora of issues.  Especially with forced breaks, where the manager is not even able to leave the building. One of the company values is ""superior returns to our share holders"" and i can tell you that seemingly is their only value that they are considered with. This is a stepping stone job, so those just starting in retail management this would be a good fit for."
bad,"My typical day at work consist of training, development and leading a team or teams. I've learned how to get productive results which in hand has delivered more sales and inventory results. I enjoy being able to teach other managers how to get better results in team building, leadership, inventory control and sales profit."
bad,Not enough staff to accomplish all needed doing. Low salary. Management unsure if what they were doing.  No organization. I often had to fill in on back office duties to keep it organized because manager was clueless.
bad,"Worked there a year, was always passed over for management cause of my age even if i do the job way better then the older people, would be sent to closer stores when out of stuff or management would go and leave me to deal with customers alone, holidays are a mad house, gets breaks if not busy, have to be quick and nice, be ready to count a lot of change from customers, older ladies were always rude. the sale were rough along with people that dont read their coupons."
bad,"You are replaceable to them. they expect you to work your hardest and give nothing in return. They try to jam pack different tasks and jobs in a 4 to 7 hour shift while you are the main cashier and Manager on duty, very stressful work environent. No employee apprieciation at all. Very unprofessional and unknowledgable."
bad,"This job is horrible. Management is horrible, Manager promised that he'd start me off at $8.75 but i ended up getting paid minimum wage. Also I was a very hard and dedicated worker, So he also kept saying he was going to promote me. He hired a new girl and she didn't have experience but promoted her on her 3rd day working there."
bad,The manager was overly critical and abusive.  She did not treat the staff well.  The store was in disrepair and needed to be redone.  it was not a fun place to work.
bad,"I'm an 18 year old senior in high school and I ran the district. The District Manager has no idea how to run a district, a lot of his stores are failing. He made me run a store while still in school. I didn't get a day off for almost 2 months, my first day off was when I collapsed at school from exhaustion. Do not work for Dollar General."
bad,I have nothing to say . I like working their but there are no benefits .They do not even offer you a discount for being a worker. also you have to buy your own work clothes.
bad,"Worked there for several years in a management capacity, little to no career advancement, was not uncommon to work 7 days a week and open to close (7:30AM-10:30PM) several days a week."
bad,Terrible place to work. Preach family but don't care. No benefits for employees without you paying out of pocket. Employees hate coming to work daily morale very LOW.
bad,I don't recommend working here ever. Poor environment. Unrealistic expectations. It's very obvious the company does not care for it's employees. Very disappointed.
bad,cashier stock shelves got to have things done at  special time trying to accomplish everything at once u  get  to meet new people all the time customers treat u like family
bad,"Way too many hours worked, sometimes 7 hours as only person in a store with no breaks. The benefits package was the worst I have ever seen. There is a tremendous amount of internal theft that is not handled."
bad,The corporation itself does not value lower level employees or the contributions they provide to greet it's customers and handle day to day operations. The delivery and ordering of dollar general product is as cheap and as thoughtless as a company can get. The company has cut holiday time off to being non existent.
bad,"Management made derogatory remarks, bad language. Very unprofessional place to work. Treated the employees terrible, would NEVER recommend someone to work there"
bad,Not much else to say. People are often asked to complete tasks well outside of their job description due to the inefficiency of management. Would often schedule shifts to start right as the store should open which leads to customers being inside the store before anything is properly set up.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Wasted 9 years of my life that I will never get back. Management never is stable and they don't know about your store, they maintain that every store is the same, and what one store can do the other can do. Unstable work environment, unappreciative upper management, and when they visit plan on working 24 hours before they come to visit just to get yelled at about what your not doing."
bad,You are better off working at Wal-mart.  A lot of work is piled on you with very little pay.  You can't afford to even think about benefits.  It is just to much work and stress for very little pay.  I think I have gray hairs in less then 6 months.  My best piece of advice is don't do it.
bad,no respect with the current store and district manager. All they care about is taking money. Those who do drugs have a better chance. Best to stay out!
bad,"Supervisors lie every night about how many hours we will be working. If you like a lot of overtime and a lot of bodily pain, this is the job for you!!"
bad,They don't tell you what the job really wants is you to have no life and make them money and not yourself.  I left a great job to come to this terrible blackhole.
bad,"Easily one of the worst companies to work for."
bad,Every day started with stretching and a butt chewing about our production numbers. I worked in repack it definitely isn't the worst place in the building but it was bad. Constant mandatory overtime and the worked us so hard that it hurt to sleep.
bad,Horrible district and regional management. 60+ hour work weeks with no support. Worst company I have ever worked for. No respect from DM. Terrible store conditions.
bad,I personally would not recommend anyone work there. The upper managers don't care who they hire as long as they are not the ones in the store. The store is always a mess.
bad,"Employees are just a number, they don't put in any time for proper training because they feel if the employee doesn't learn quickly on their own get rid of them and move on"
bad,I had a customer who everyone knew was crazy call and complain about me several times because she didn't like me. I was fired because after 3 complaints they are required to fire you no matter what. My store manager tried to stick up for me and keep me but the district manager said he had no choice and fired me after 2 years of working there. I was also ridiculed by the company for having my hair dyed and wearing a lot of makeup.
bad,"I have been working for this company for 2 years going on 3. Just last 2-3 week we just moved into a new building. You would think that we would get more hours... last week i received 0 hours. This week i was told that he was going to put us on our regular schedule but yet i only worked 4 and was cut the day i had to work. It's getting real frustrating, because 2 months ago I became an owner of a vehicle, now this."
bad,"OK for a second job. No full-time schedules unless in management, and very little pay for work performed, especially in management. Managers and workers very transitory. Fluctuating hours according to store manager's whim. Starts cashiers at minimum wage- other comparable positions pay much better."
bad,"No quality of life to be had here, you worked 60 + hours a week, and were always being subjected to a new district manager every 6 months because of the high turnover in the company"
bad,"This company is a workhorse. Hours are constantly cut, You get a $0.25 raise every year annually. Otherwise there are no raises without Promotions... and very few promotions to be had."
bad,"Worked open to close most days. "
bad,Dollar General is a good company to work for as a first job or second job. If you go into the management field you work way more hours than they tell you in the interview and you are not compensated for any overtime.
bad,"The customers were great, as always there were a few bad eggs. My associates were good to work with except management. It was a frustrating environment."
bad,"I really don't have nothing to say about the Dollar General I worked at. I did get along with my co-workers and that was really the best part of working there. The manager really didn't care about anything as long as the job got done, not even when I got hurt on the job. Nothing was done, so there's nothing more to say."
bad,The store wasn't well run by the manager it was always a mess because she was always living the store wasn't take care of business to handle the stuff that needed to be done also she was taking people hours
bad,"Good place to work until I transferred to Chilhowie.  This manager worked very little and took credit for others hard work. He or his assistant very seldom worked closing shifts. He also left us more to do than we could finish in the time allowed. Sometimes we didn't get a break at all. Leads would have to work a full eight hour shift without any help. If there are no hours for hourly associates, the manager is supposed to be there, our manager never was. This is the worst manager I have ever worked for.."
bad,Dollar General does not care about their employees. They will cut you off without any notice whatsoever. They do not provide benefits unless you're a manager.
bad,I do not like my job no one likes to work always complaining. The store is a mess no one likes to follow rules and do what's told customers complain about how messy and unorganized the store be
bad,"As store Manager we need to work too many hours at the end the pay its not enough. I learned how to deal with different cultures, how people shop with a specifics budgets. As the Store manager its hard to communicate with others Managers of the Company. Like Lost Prevention. We dont have lost prevention at the stores and it is difficult for us handle LP situations at the stores."
bad,"Although Dollar General is a company that is very easy to promote in, the work expectations are unrealistic, very fast paced and stressful; and there is no work life balance. They are  open every holiday at full hours."
bad,"hired to work 35-40hrs a week -rarely happened"
bad,"Not organized at all, it took a while but eventually they got it together. Unprofessional at times, nonchalant towards the customers and just plan rude. I will never work here again."
bad,"The company does not cares about their employees. when there are bad weather conditions the regional and district managers still make employees go in to work even through road closures and flooding occurs. if someone calls in to work its the store manager, assistant, or lead key holders responsiblity to work that persons shift even if we have to work double shifts, 50+ hours, or two straight. we have to do whatever it is to keep the store running. the store can not close for any reason. you are being called throughout the day and night. its hard to balance work and family time with this company. store managers are only required to have 1 1/2 day off. we are trained to know that no one is to call in for any reason or its a write up unless of death in immediate family after 3 write ups of absence you are terminated. they provide good health benefits for full time people."
bad,"Over worked and under paid. They don't care about their employees. They don't give you the tools or resources to accomplish your daily tasks, always asking you to cut hours, turnover is huge because of job requirements."
bad,"A typical work day usually consists of complete silence, and isolation until a customer reaches their point of sale. "
bad,"Terribly lazy management."
bad,"Dollar general was my first job in High School. Pay was very little, managers were hard to work with and employees cared very little about their jobs. What I enjoyed most about my job were the hours and the location."
bad,"Always working, have no time for a social life or to spend time with family due to working holidays as well. Ridiculous expectations for the time frame given to work and do not care about any excuses even if it involves assisting customers."
bad,I loved working for dollar general until I got a new district manager. Since then I have left the company because he was out to get me anyways. I requested to step down and they refused. I also requested to be transferred but they ignored that too. They suck and I would never recommend anyone work in this low down place unless an absolute last resort.
bad,You will only work consistently if you are in management.People are not the nicest.Hard to get hours unless the needs of the company are an issue.open late
bad,"At the Dollar General they don't really care about your schedule outside of work (student) or if you get sick, or injured, and theres no benefits whatsoever. Not even discounted food on the job. They will think you're stealing from them if the recepit didn't print. If you make an error counting money they think you stole it etc. They are a very distrusting and uncaring company."
bad,"Worked as main cashier most of the time, did re-stocking of the shelves, cleaned the bathrooms and the sales floor when needed. Helped customers locate items within the store itself."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, they do not care about you or anything else life might throw at you. I was fired due to going to the restroom due to monthly problems women have."
bad,Not enough hours they want you to do all this work for little pay not only 2 employees in a shift.. Had 5 managers in less than a year this last manager is so rude she wont talk to employees wont give eye contact i have been getting 4 to 5 hours each week for the last 2 months its like the new manager wants a new crew and i am supposed to be one of the best employee there... Its terrible to work there .and to top it off the manager and assistant go outside to smoke cigarettes together just about every hour just taking breaks after breaks for about 15 minutes every time not fair for the ones that dont smoke.
bad,"If you have no desire to experience a life outside of work, Dollar General is the job for you!  Working for this exciting, poorly led organization pretty much promises to have you at work for 60 or more hours a week...and field leadership makes it very clear that even that may not be enough!"
bad,"I would only recommend Dollar General to someone is is truly desperate.  A job to take while you search for a better employer.  The mandatory 6 day work week is exhausting. And, it's such a bad place to work it's almost impossible to hire and retain a quality staff."
bad,I worked at 2 Dollar General Locations. The store mangers hire their friends so they get first pick of the hours they want to work which is the morning shift and they don't work the closing shift. And then tell the other sales associates that they have to be able to work all shifts.
bad,I loved the job & customers but disliked the store manager. If it was supervised by someone with a better attitude & gave raises it would be a great place to work.
bad,I worked at DG for about a year. The pay is rediculously low. They treat you like criminals making you turn your pockets inside out every time you walk out of the store (even just to go to your car). The whole system is a mess!
bad,Staff was extremely unprofessional and rude. Work conditions were bad in the shipping department. All the jobs are meant for a minimum of two people. The area it is in didn't have enough population to fill the jobs. So all extra work was put on day shift. On top of that day shift was also stuff with what night shift failed to do. Which was an everyday thing.
bad,"unprofessional management"
bad,"The job it self was easy enough, but the management at that location made things very uncomfortable for the employees."
bad,"I worked as a store manager for 5 years, no support from.my district manager.  Work hours i would put in 50.to 60 hours a week and pay was not comparable for what you worked.  You had no life outside the store."
bad,Do not want to work with you. Had to cancel my daughter doctors appointment due to change of schedules last minute. Not good management at all.
bad,"DG is a complete joke. Management does not care about the employees at all. They just want a body in the store. Management does drugs. Expected to stock, cashier, recover, inventory, place signage, and everything for pennies. No one comes to work as expected and complaints go unheard."
bad,They do not pay enough for everything they expect you to do.  The regional management are total jerks they don't care about the employees and run everyone to death especially store managers.  Even if you manage to get a promotion the stress and hassle is  not worth it at all.
bad,"Unless you are favored by the supervisors you will never get any where in this company. The select people they favor could literally get away with murder in there and still have a job with no repercussions. If they don't like you, they will watch your every move to get rid of you. We have a rate of 100% that we have to hit every week and if you get 99% for the week they will write you up. The supervisors think they are untouchables and act like you have to bow down to them. They talk down to you and make you feel so little and Incapable of doing your job. They make fun of people behind their backs....I've witnessed it a ridiculous amount of times.   Don't ever tell them no, it will result in termination. We have been doing 12 hours-5 days a week (Sunday-Thursday), with a random Friday thrown in for the last almost 5 months and people are getting hurt every day because we're all over worked and the higher ups don't want to hear about it. This place is getting run into the ground by a new Head honcho that took over.  All the higher ups say the care about you and your family life, but in reality all they care about is your production. They will make you work over 12 hours if they want too....it's happened numerous times. The turn over rate is pathetically high....90%. "
bad,"this is an ok place to work, I would not go back in most stores the staff is not friendly that is all I have to say. They do not have enough of a payroll budget to effectively run a store"
bad,"I started work here during March of my senior year in high school. I was only able to stand seven months at this Dollar General Market. Working here was like a nightmare, especially for my first job.The place is severely understaffed, only having 1-2 cashiers between 5 and 10 (which is extremely busy), 1 lead (sometimes they never showed), and the MOD. The MODs were rude and insulting to both the employees and customers. The co-workers I had would often bad-mouth each other and the customer IN FRONT OF the customer. They don't work, they hide in the back when they're supposed to be working. The managers don't even care. Instead of running a business like they're supposed to, they treat the customers and employees like trash because they know they can get away with it."
bad,I believe under the right management team the dollar general has the potential to be a great place to work but as is now they are very understaffed and are very misleading to there management in hopes of advancement and treating them as level 1 associates.
bad,"The job consisted of stocking the store, working the cash register, unloading truck once a week, and maintaining the upkeep and outlook of the store I worked in. A typical day was usually between a 5 and 8 hour shift. I learned how to properly work a cash register and how to create and maintain customer satisfaction. My manager and co-workers were all upstanding professionals and, to this day, are all close friends of mine. "
bad,"A typical day at work was 6am until....I learned how to reset Planograms and endcaps.  The District Managers have so many stores that they don't have time to really help you with anything.  Training only lasted for 2 weeks in a different location and the rest you learn on your own.  The job was okay, but the subordinate managers are allowed to curse the upper management out without any repercussion."
bad,Schedule is done for two weeks and advance. Management is not sure what they're going to do on a day-to-day basis . I was there from 8 AM to 10 group of mothers with children
bad,"Terrible manager. Regional Manager almost never promotes from within. The job itself was alright, but the pay was terrible. I don't feel like I learned anything more than how to extend my patience. I connected with most of my customers, and stay in contact with some of them to this day. Co-workers were pretty awesome, though. Most of us quit or were fired because of the store manager's lack of empathy. Only cared about themselves."
bad,"The pay isn't worth the headache and time away from your family. District Manager and up are completely clueless about what it takes to actually run a store. Corporate expects you to move mountains, but doesn't give you enough payroll to even keep your store staffed, much less actually get everything done that they expect."
bad,Was a friendly environment. Short hours. Minimum wage. No opportunity for advancement. No opportunity for full time. I accepted the job in Florida and was told hours would increase each month. Hours did increase monthly in FL but once I got to IA my hours were halted at 20 and less a week.
bad,"needs to pay employers more for the hard work they do, managment comes and goes same with employees, the work is hard so there for should get paid a little more"
bad,"Poor management, no values within the company. There was no structure or professionalism. I came into work and did my job and went home when my shift was over, there was no room for advancement."
bad,"Management is way too shaky at times, especially when dealing with corporate office they take it out on the employees and the pressure is to great for management."
bad,Dollar General is a grinder. Store managers have to put in 50 - 60 hours and always have to cover for cuts in labor.  Typically 1 to 2 people on at a time.  But have to do the work of 4.Company doesn't care about you or ur personal life.  There are a few good managers out there but they are not typical
bad,Did not stay long dollar general was a very dishonest company and changing things like your pay and not paying overtime when worked would not ever work there again.
bad,"It seemed that only I and one other girl that worked there actually worked and everyone else sat on their phones, no one cleaned but me and the place was always trashed."
bad,"There is no work/life balance in this organization. You are only allowed a day and a half off. They do not support store managers, nor do they compensate for the amount of work that is required. If all you want to do is work freight and never come home to your family, then this is the job for you."
bad,A typical day was busy.  I learn that you can be multi- talented in other areas.  Management was decent.  Co-workers were okay.  The hardest part was try to trust and believe what your co-workers were going to do.  The hours were decent.
bad,Dollar General is the sort of company that falsifies documents in order to cover up OSHA violations of a serious nature. My store was robbed at gunpoint on a weekday afternoon and when the DM finally arrived as the police were leaving he was more concerned about getting the doors opened again than the crime that had just taken place. Every person above store management level I encountered was an inept busybody clearly out of touch with the status their company actually had.
bad,"I learned that every place that you work is not going to be everything that you want, and to over come it you have to make the best of it."
bad,They expect everything all the time from the manager.  It does not matter what is needed in the family the store comes first.  I did not enjoy working for this company at all
bad,"Training ; you watched a video and then told to do it, put on a register first day for 8 hours with no help or back up. "
bad,"I like the hard, steady work, but there was limited positive interaction between other staff and customers, and co-worker to co-worker.  My lack of a second language was also a henderance to good quality customer service."
bad,They are unrealistic on store managers and associates.  Unrealistic ideas of amount of work possible with what stores are given
bad,"I started as an Assistant Manager and within two weeks I was promoted to Store Manager. The District Manager made alot of empty promises as well as threatened myself and my crew on a weekly basis. She expected impossible results with the crew I had. Refused to recognize any of my employees for what they accomplished. I turned a $65,000 a year shrink store into about $10,000 in less than two months.I lead my district in charitable contributions as well as sales and marketing. THe district manager promised me $45,000 per year salary but when I received my promotion I was only making $36,000 pre tax."
bad,"It's a job guys. Take it or leave it. I can't begin to give a review on all the ludicrous stuff you'll have to put up with. Finding good management is like finding water in a desert for this company. If you're 18 and need to get a job so you're parents don't yell at you, then go for it. But please do yourself a favor and find something better in the midst. I worked there for 2 years and you'll deal with extremely rude customers, and witness some of the laziest immature employees you've ever seen. I worked an evening shift and our manager had me come into work then to keep an eye on a 50 year old sales associate. I babysit a 50 year old sales associate because he was acting up. I stocked the entire shift and did my job. He stood there and got paid for nothing. I didn't quit after that night, but I quit after working 4th of July because I had put up with everything. On top of that, on that day I stocked an entire side by myself while both my managers were team tagging the easiest part of the store. I was yelled at for not finishing 1 freight in 1 hour on the hardest part of the store to stock while they helped each other on paper. My girlfriend convinced me to quit, and it was easily one of the best decisions I ever made. Unless you're taking over a store as a manager, and you actually get paid your worth which is $10/hr, don't stick around long. Minimum wage for busting your tail stocking while at the same time having to run back to the register to take care of a customer just isn't worth it. It made me realize I need an education, or work hard in sports and music and my talents."
bad,"Good job for anyone that dont have bills to pay..easy work but stressful when you have to cashier,help customers, stock, recover merchandise, face, take out garbage,clean bathroom,sweep,mop,in a 4 hour shift,.and having a manager that has mood swings dont help..,favoritism too....VERY DISORGANIZED COMPANY THAT DONT CARE ABOUT/APPRECIATE THEIR EMPLOYEES,,,,,"
bad,hated it hated it my worse decision i ever made in my life i made decent money but the stress that dollar general brings to the table is not worth it very disorganized company over stock u with product an still exspect u to run the store when they cut hours making it impossible to run a store or to keep employees
bad,I Hated This Job Do Not Work Here Lack Of Hours The Managers Work Their Employees To Death Shows No Appreciation And The Managers Is Mean And Hard-Driving I Wouldnt Recommend Anybody To Work Here At All Period
bad,Attempts to promote ethical principles that set standards of organizational & individual behavior in work environments. Should provide opportunities for growth and recognition to deserving individuals.
bad,"Working Customer Service was a pleasure, however Dollar General does not value their customers or employees. The hours are typical customer service hours, but breaks are not allotted as they are suppose to. Management will fix time schedules to show the cover the lack of lunch breaks."
bad,"I been working for this company for 1 year and 3 months. At the beginning everything was just fine and I use to enjoy going to work. I had my hours cut drastically from 3 and 4 days a week down to 1 maybe 2 days a week. We have new a new manager and she is very hard to get along with. No one likes the way she do her schedule. She schedule people according to their work performance and speed. So, if you are not up to speed you get less days on the schedule. Her attitude towards customers and employees is not good either. I hate to say but she is gonna lose some employees behind her attitude and the way she treats people."
bad,"Management was horrible, I hardly got breaks, I was there almost everyday and did not get a day off. Manager was rude and the place was dirty."
bad,"I called my DM into corporate because we had all new management in, and he wrote people up for not knowing what they actually needed to do.  I was fired the same day I called in on my DM."
bad,when I worked at Dollar General I had a great time working with the staff and we had a lot of fun all while getting all the work done.
bad,only a good place to shop..  The managers suck.  they do not know how to work with people.  They also do so many things out of spite its unreal.  hopefully they got some new people in there since I last worked their.
bad,"Dollar General was a great place to work when I first started.  When a new management company took over several years ago, it really changed. The company's safety record is not very good, the management need a lot of improvement, you never see the managers on the floor, Communication is bad  and employee turnover is at 50 percent. There is no incentive for production other than you keep your job.  I am grateful for the 16 years I worked there, but it was time to move on. Even if it did mean getting fired."
bad,"I worked at a location in Grand Prairie, TX. I came in 5 days a week, was constantly asked to work extra hours and called in on days off and after ending a shift at least twice a week. The work is easy but I worked way too hard to only make $120 a week. The manager gave herself a substantial amount of hours while throwing the scrap hours to everyone else. It's no secret as to why that location is always hiring."
bad,"It's a great place to work, if you like consistently moving then this would be the place for you.I love being in Retail Management,its keeps you busy an you are consistently moving"
bad,dollar general is not a good place to work.. managers are two face and will run you under the bus when things go wrong.  breaks are ridiculiousily short. you are expected to be available to work even if you have vacation planned. the managers are rude to customers and employees.
bad,I have been employed by dollar general for only a week and doubt I'll be going back. I have not been properly trained at all. You are supposed to do CBL's (computer based learning) and I have not been allowed to do them. I was thrown on the register...with little money. There were only quarters and big bills and told to ring customers (with magic I suppose). There was no receipt paper so no one could get a receipt for their orders which did not make me popular with customers. I asked the supervisor how to load money onto someones prepaid credit card and she slammed down a stack of cards and walked away. (So helpful). She kept disappearing outside so when I needed help or a void I had to hunt her down and the line would get backed up and had no help to get it down. You do back breaking work with no training and no pay. I would not suggest anyone to work for this company. I won't even shop there anymore after this.
bad,I am a assistant manager and the store is not people ready and the management in the upper department does not listen and help at all.
bad,"Get there and clock in. And start recovering the store, making sure product was facing and easy too find."
bad,"It was a job, the management could have been better. Weekly pay general labor, stocking cleaning etc. It wasnt all bad room for improvement."
bad,"I stocked shelves and that crew was pretty good. I learned only what to shop for when I am there. The company never cared what anyone thought, not even manager's."
bad,bad place to work. management stole hours from my pay check. Sad when your part time trying to put food on the table. will not recommend employment unless it's a last resort.
bad,"spending well more than the 48 hrs they tell you will be working along with an upper management that wasn't very supportive. opening and closing store procedures. Assisting in unloading truck. Upholding good customer service, store cleanliness. weekly outs count, and on-hand changes."
bad,"Drama between other employees all of the time, Changes in management happen suddenly and violently."
bad,"Horrible hours, low standards on cleanliness, unfair scheduling, under staffed"
bad,"Upper management was immoral.  Very little pay for the amount of work you have to do.  Enjoyed the customers, but not the unrealistic work load."
bad,If you enjoy long hours with descent pay the job is ok. I can find nothing to say good about this company because they have double standards every other week the production rate is raised. And people who work have to work so much harder just so the but kissers can do nothing. Rate is jacked up when they say you have to have this % one week and then get written up the next for hitting that rate. But still co workers are great and we still hit production but still worst job I have ever worked! And the 95% turnover shows this   hole is ran and how our bosses treat us like slaves and laugh when we fail. Just look somewhere else you will thank me later if you did.
bad,Was nice working with regular and new customer. Was able to move into management quickly.
bad,A typical day was stocking cleaning doing any paperwork that needed to be done. I also made the schedule and did payroll each week. There was a high turn-over rate so Co-Workers came and went but I'm a super friendly and cool person so I was got along with everyone. The hardest part about working there was the turn-over rate and short staffed all the time. overtime
bad,You all in all have to be ADHD and or very good at multitasking to an extreme level.. Rules and regulations are not always enforced and consideration for the well being of their employees goes out the window unless you are part of the in crowd. Don't get me wrong. I worked here for three years but in the end I was forced out due to the fact that I had medical things going on and they didn't want to cover the benefits due a full time associate..
bad,"If I didn't need a paycheck, I would have quit the first week.  Open store, reshelf isles, price check, stock, time limits for every task."
bad,"Dollar General was one of the worst places that I have ever worked.  I only took the job because a ""friend"", who I had worked with at KMart, became the manager and wanted me to come to work for him as a cashier.  I soon found out that the reason he wanted me was that his employees, disgusted with his lack of management skill, were quitting right and left.  I soon found out that the only way to get the work done was to do things like clock out for lunch and continue to work, that he could not do simple things like hire replacements for the people who quit, and that the store was chronically full of merchandise that had come in on the truck that we lacked the time or staff to unload and get up on the shelf.  He would schedule himself for 50+ hours a week and then call me in to cover so he could drive to visit his girlfriend in Culloden, or to cover one of the cashiers who called in at the drop of a hat.  He finally hired a girl who worked with his mother, the manager of the Dollar General in Sophia, who he said he wanted to make the Assistant Manager.  The day she arrived she said she wanted to turn around and go back to the store she came from, and that she had no interest in being the Assistant Manager, as that meant closing nights.  She claimed she had gotten a job as a CNA at a nearby hospital and would be leaving.  On my last day there, she informed me she was staying because he had promised her a $2.00 an hour raise, promoted her to Assistant Manager, and that she would not have to close nights.  I realized that was why they had been training me to close for the past week."
bad,"The store in South Ripley is not managed well as of the late spring of 2014. The managers do people wrong. Watch out if they say they will hire you but do not complete all of your initial hire requirements. After a month, someone I know was cut from them and blindsided by it. They cannot keep the store in order and the corporation people cannot keep them in order either. They provided poor training and will throw new hires under the bus. The store is a mess and they never have enough people working as they should. Applicant BEWARE. Best to go some place else."
bad,"Just bad nothing much to stay."
bad,Dollar Geeneral pitched the Store Manager job to me as a 45-50 work week salary job. Only after a few weeks in it turned in a an 80-90 hour a week nightmare. Paperwork is redundant. Management never listens to your concerns. HR ignores clear violation of policy. Unless you want to bleed yellow and black I would steer clear. As a manager you are told you have the ability to hire and fire. This however is not the case. Job culture is taught but not followed. Without a question the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,No pay no work NEVER WORK HERE.im a groid that starts with knee.they all smell like chicken bacauk bacauk
bad,poor management bad place to work. Very very high turn over. they fire people over the stupidest things. you have to be at 95% to 100% to keep your job
bad,Management shows very immature qualities and very little leadership skills. There is little to no training. There's no possibility for promotions or raises. The only positive I would acknowledge is that the actual work is not very difficult.
bad,Just say no worst place to ever work worst 3 monthhs of my life a lot of back stabbing managers
bad,never took care of employs the way they should have didnt listen to suggestions on things we needed always had a problem with over stock and didnt give raises when they was supposed to this review dosnt go for all dollar generals i have seen dollar general that are ran the way they are supposed to be ran.
bad,"I don't even know where to begin. I worked there for a year and the beginning it was okay but the more you work there... You realize the company and the managers are.. Well are terrible and corp. I won't even talk about. Also, I got a promotion there after two months of being there and never got my raise."
bad,I didn't enjoy it. People were rude that were in management. I think that it could have been a better business if management was different. When people came in they would always know when a certain manager was in with the way people would act within the business
bad,"too much work pressure and the Director/manager of web services team is like pest who will suck your blood. no work at all, creates unnecessory work. colleagues pass time by reading newspaper."
bad,"I would come in count money drawer, in between customers I would stock merchandise. end of night I would clean store and restrooms."
bad,Management did not train properly. Schedules were UN regular and could of use more support from management.
bad,"Being hired as a ""Store manager candidate"" to me means ok I'm next up for a store. when the company hires a manager from outside, with no retail experience then its time to move on"
bad,"Dollar General managment team is not prepared for the situations that are a part of the whole retail experience. My cooworders were great!  However, no one ever stays more than a few months. I did like the customers from a small town environment and in no time we were ""like family""."
bad,"I was supposed to be hired as a Store Manager. The week before I started I was told I would be an Assistant Manager for a few weeks till I got used to the store. I did not receive any of my training because we were way under staffed. They would hire kids that would not show up, not even call off, then quite after a few days. "
bad,I would like a better job. somewhere I could possibly move up in management and grow with the company.
bad,Not a very good company to work for. Management doesn't train new employees very well.
bad,They do not treat people fairly. Bad management. No job security. I would not suggest working there.
bad,Everyday at work was hard. They set unrealistic goals. They want you to work yourself to death then fire you because you don't make 100% every week. I did not enjoy anything about working in this warehouse.
bad,"Traveled to various stores and helped with inventory, stock, and covering shifts for other managers.Got along great with staff team and enjoyed the challenage. Learned how to use handheld inventory scanner to control loss and place orders. On your feet the whole time and never having a store that did not have too much stock that needed to be stocked or damaged because it was out of date."
bad,"Dollar General is the most paranoid company to work for in terms of not trusting their own employees. They feel that their employees will steal more from them than the actual shoplifting customers. Low pay, no discounts of any sort, and the work/life balance consists of more life than work due to lack of hours. Two people run the entire store. While one stays on the cash register, the other has to recover the entire store, check in all deliveries, keep an eye out for shoplifters, help the cashier during rushes, make change for the cashier, void transactions, and restock everything... and all in 4 hours. It's pretty bad walking in to the store and being told to take a 90 minute lunch break because your hours for the week are too high. "
bad,"you never have enough help, they expect you to work 65 hrs a week, you don't get enough hrs for your employees "
bad,"Started working there and they did not train me, they literally made me mange the whole store by myself with no experience while the were in the back doing nothing."
bad,"Co-workers were okay, but not willing to work up to their potential. Learned the job as I went along, training was not in detail."
bad,"Whatever you do, don't go to work for Dollar General. All they care about is the bottom line.Money!"
bad,"and being as it is, a number. they should know it takes more than what they pay to survive in this world let alone advance to anything close to comfortable."
bad,Do not work for this company. They hire family members and practice unethical culture.
bad,i liked working there but there was to much slacking off. I gave my 110% but learned that i should just work what it is not give my full effort on it didnt get credit for none of the work i had done.
bad,"No matter how hard you work for Dollar General you're just a number to them. Even your District Manager won't stand up for you, even though they know you did nothing wrong but only wants to protect their own job."
bad,Did not have a great time working for this company. There was no suport from upper management. There was a lot of dishonesty and some imoral behavior that was totaly overlooked.
bad,its an ok place to work. My team is the reason I kept going back. The manages seem to not really know what she was doing but they salesfloor team terrific
bad,"Dollar General will hire just about anyone as both cashiers, Managers, and district managers. In my almost year of experience there, I have found that they will work you on 12-14 hour shifts and pull doubles to cover everyone else's shift, you will be expected to put out all merchandise from one maybe two 18-wheeler trucks a week with in two- three days, you will be reamed for not completing tasks in a certain way or forgoing one task for another more urgent task, you will very rarely be thanked, congratulated, or given praise for a job well done. In some stores, you will be asked to work off the clock, against company policy or not receive a weekly schedule, only being called many times daily to come in and work. I have worked in two separate Dollar General stores and the issues are consistent through both."
bad,"I enjoyed the job customer relations. The company was very unfair in the expectations of the overall store accomplishments by providing the manager inadequate staff and labor hours. The upper management was generally very rude, not really understanding proper conduct in dealing with problems. I learned that you should always be fair, honest and have great integrity dealing with others and subordinates even if your upper management does not give you, a manager, a fair deal. Always set a proper example."
bad,Typical day evening shifts 5 days out of the week. Co workers and some of the customers hard to get along with. Hardest part was on sat truck day and 1st of the month when they cut hours or people didn't show up for work and the manager nor assistant wants to come in. When we were without a manager I had to step in as temp manager and was never compensated for it. At least I learned how to make a schedule and had store manager experience
bad,"The expierance i had at working for Dollar General was hot , work verty quickly for 10 hrs. The work it self isn't bad, it is the management team that reallly makes it hard. If you look to see how many supervisers they go through, and the constant running add, and are do discriminate. They only hire who they want to, not the best person for the job, For a job just until you get another one it wouldn't be bad, but really look to the company as a whole, Their stores are usually trashed out, always hiring new people and the products you can buy cheaper at the local market."
bad,This job is more for people who are new to job force. Great for high schoolers or someone looking for just a part time position
bad,"Enjoyed serving the public and working with my co-workers, the company wasnt a very good one to work for but i appreciate the opportunity that was given"
bad,"Great for someone who wants to make pocket money. Poor management, not for adults with family, unless you are in management, or apply for management."
bad,"management is insensitive and has no regards for any of its employees until district managers come in for a visit. no employee at this location is happy. but we love our jobs and our customers but the management is terrible, the customers notices how management treats employees and complains about management NOT doing their jobs as well."
bad,"Not enough hours or pay,dont get alot of hours but cashier,customer service,sales,retail,inventory"
bad,"Back stabbing staff including management, little training, work long hours without breaks, large workload with little time to complete at closing. Assistant manager over steps bounds/rude and condescending to new employees."
bad,"Extremely too much pressure on the managers, they say only work 45 to 50hrs. Then make you work 60-90 hours. And you end up making less than your employees."
bad,"I don’t think dollar general pays enough for the work I was having to do."
bad,No one cares how much work u do as long as the manager doesn't have to do it you will be fine. Dm was so not caring about any problems u had hav or will have...
bad,Have seen so many people quit because of management. Need working managers that are nit afraid to get hands dirty instead of being in office all day and doing nit much .
bad,Working here is good if you are always wanting to be busy. But you can't get anything done. Hours are cut bad. They don't seem to respect me or my mental health. Only one good manager honestly.
bad,Corporate can screw you over by hiring irrational managers and not care for how store does. Pay is weak and job is easy but at what cost if not done right. This job is more for fresh graduates or people desperate for a job. You wont be getting any revenue of liking with part time positions.
bad,DONT WORK HERE! Trust me. They’re a horrible company and only care about the money. They do not care about their employees. You will work your fingers to the bone for basicallly nothing.
bad,Would be better under new management. Needs more staff scheduled during shifts. Need more experienced managers. Need better training requirements. should have better stock planograms.
bad,They have their priorities all mixed up. They have women doing lots of heavy lifting while the men walk around and train or drive reach trucks. I dislocated my shoulder twice but they didn’t care. They still want you to lift lots of heavy things even while injured.
bad,"I was hired, worked one day for training then the manager repeatedly took my assigned shifts and gave them to someone else. I was not put on the schedule after that first week yet I got a notice in the mail I had been terminated for not showing up for my assigned shift. I hope management is/was that bad and uncaring at that specific store."
bad,My manager never trained me for the job. I was harassed by coworkers everyday I worked. No flexibility as far as hours go. I called off once to see my grandma in the hospital and a couple days later was told that I’m on the edge of getting fired because I call off too much
bad,"This company makes me seriously want to puke. Never have seen anything like it in my life. It's like applying for the Secret Service in the time it takes to get hired, AND then once hired, there is basically no proper training and no available hours. Why waste time and hire people when you clearly have no hours to offer them? The pay is horrible, the job is demanding, the classic American case of, ""Understaffed, overworked, and underpayed."" The only positive thing about the job was the other employees, and the Store Manager. They were pretty awesome. So it was nice to meet them, other than that,,,,,,,,,Dollar General could have been a great company, but they chose to be a greedy, slave driving company.  I did end up having a HUGE crush on my Store Manager. A good looking hard worker is always noticed :)"
bad,"I would be taunted at work by my manager and would do her duties while getting paid minimum wage. I was not respected, nor was I treated equal by them."
bad,There is no work life balance at dollar General. If your a store manager they except you to work over 60 hours a week.  There are no opportunities for advancement at all! The company has changed and is now slamming merchandise into stores without consideration of where it will go. They are constantly making you do extra work that is not included in your job title but don’t want to pay extra for it. Overall I would not recommend this as a place to work.
bad,poor management.. hires people that cant do the task as applied for.. ask to much out of people from the get go. they rewrote the hand book after the warehouse opened in longview.. wasnt the same rules that was told from the start
bad,"No hours , that was the reason for leaving 15 hours per week. How could anyone life on that. 8.50 a hour as well. Overall terrible experience manager shows favoritism"
bad,"I took over the store because the manger got fired for not doing their job.  I cleaned up the store, made sales go up, made great customer service and made good rapport with the customers.  Did all that while hitting the payroll budget, which was very low.  Expected me to work 80 hs every week only paid for 48. Constant call outs and no one would cover."
bad,"Low pay and very high expectations for tasks to be completed. I am an extremely hard worker bit to be the only one on the register and expected to recover the store, put away inventory AND keep an eye out for thieves while the key holder is on a task in the back stock room for the whole shift.... Since my availability isn't ""open"" Sometimes I'll be off for 6 or 7 days because managers and key holders get top priority with hours."
bad,"When I got hired, I was promised 3-4 days of work since I was part time. The manager who hired me was fired the day before I was supposed to start. So my first day, I had no training and was basically thrown on the register without really knowing anything. The people I worked with were really nice though. New manager comes in and cuts all the new people down to 1-2 days a week and cut us from 8 to 6 hours as well. I texted the manager to request a day off and she was EXTREMELY rude about it. I ended up quitting because I wasn’t getting paid enough to work 1 or 2 days a week for 6 hours. Pay is normally $7.25 but the manager who hired me started her employees at $8.00. The customers were really nice and I did enjoy the job but the manager ruined it for me."
bad,"This is a company that almost everything goes. They lock of professional training, the company operates for the most part in chaos. They don’t really care about the employees and always find themselves under staff and over working loyal employees. I wouldn’t recommend a job in this company to anyone. If you don’t believe me, try it yourself and good luck."
bad,This was probably the worst job I’ve had with a company there was no opportunities to have advanced in my career was paid terrible pay for the area I lived in
bad,There's no chance at advancement. You work long hours for no pay. The management sucks and some don't know what they are doing. They play favoritism. If they would change it would be an ok place to work.
bad,What’s understand needs know explaining but the job itself was stressful then to have a DM that didn’t care about anything his workers said or done 🤦🏽‍♂️
bad,I was promised total recovered stored and it never happened.  I worked hard and was on a verge of breakthrough then comes along new DM and according to her I wasn't doing my job. She started micro managing and cutting hours of my good help and pushed me to work more and harder.
bad,"If you have good store manager, you are already succeed. I’m a full time assistance store manager. But they will not pay you 40 hrs. You only get 30 to 34 hr with little pay as possible compare to amount of 1200-1800 pieces truck. Upper management like DM always cut payroll because other store in the district overspend. DM always yells at you if the store didn’t get enough surveys. No help from DM if our staffs got short hand. Always cut hours on holidays time.  Got betray but internal career hiring because they want hire no experience person to work as store manager while in working there for 5 years. "
bad,"Need to hire more sales associates and need more hours to cover the shift "
bad,There is so much internal drama and district managers forcing people to lie on paperwork it’s rediculous  my last store manager quit due to the district manager being unprofessional and cussing her out and refusing to help or send help when requested  now that she quit all of a sudden the store is getting help but the new “manager” is a joke and is beyond messy (drama wise) and is intentionally bm screening me over because I’m friends with the previous store mana
bad,Over worked work load for 6 put one one person store managers never last ! They only care that the doors open and close and dont care if younsee youe kids .
bad,The work wasn't bad for the pay. I was a Store Manager Candidate and recieved $16.00 per hour which was higher than normal because I knew the DM. Although I made more hourly I barely got any hours 30-34 hours. MANAGEMENT is horrible which is sad because I would of stayed but had to leave for my sanity. They expect this job to be your life with no regard to your own personal affairs. I was asked to reschedule my sisters funeral to prep for a walk through.
bad,"starting out was fine towards the end things were going down hill. they changed the store manager 3 times in the year i was there. the higher up (dm, rm, hr) dont care about the the workers at store level."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Dollar General. I loved being a keyholder. The company is very unorganized, concern more with internal thief than the safety of their employees. Worked weeks without security cameras at front entrance not working. Really no way to keep a check on hours other than little slips. Will work the mess out of someone instead of managing hours correctly. Want too much with little pay. Iloved what I did overall."
bad,"Management plays favorites. You have no life, you work their every evening/night & your manager is not required to work night shifts. You only get a thirty minute break. You are literally supposed to stock & be on the register at all times even if it’s busy they never want you to be standing by the register (going to the back of the store to the front of the store all day is extremely annoying). DG try their hardest to not give you overtime (always cutting hours so you barely hit 39 hours a week). The way dollar General is set up is basically you doing too much for nothing. You only get paid for like two holidays out the year"
bad,The day was long and end up working 12 hours with no notice. The rate your supposed to hit is unfair and broken. The management also seems biased and unfair.
bad,they dont like when you ask for a day off if you always want to work every weekend with no weekend off you ask anything you might just get yelled at and they never help to fire more people
bad,"As an Assistant Manager, I would spent 3-6 hrs in the store alone. I was not able to take a restroom break or a lunch break during those times when I was by myself. It was very unsafe. Dollar General's work load is extremely have and the companies daily work expectations are unrealistic."
bad,"I have been called in before my first day just to be yelled at by the head manager of the store. I have not been trained fully. I was never taught completely on how the system works. I'm never allowed to stock the back of the store. I am never allowed to stop a customer from practically degrading me. The management at my store is horrendous. The key-holders are all stuck up and won't cover anyone's shift at all. I had to come in one day because the manager was there by herself and I wasn't even allowed to clock in at all. If that doesn't tell you how awful this store is ran then I don't know what will. Not all Dollar Generals are like this however, some I've seen work splendidly, I've wanted to change stores forever now and don't get me wrong I love work for the public but this store isn't the one to do it."
bad,My district manager was absolutely the worst. She was passive aggressive and even though she would preach to us about employee appreciation she never practiced it. I had one small infraction with a customer and was terminated due to retaliation from something that happened previously. Do not work for this company. The pay is minimal and they expect the store managers to do all of the work with very little help
bad,upper management doesn't really take care of your needs like they say. and the gm of the store doesn't work just complains about things hostile not fun
bad,The most horrible working experience I’ve ever had in retail!Store managers have no life outside of Dollar General. They expect you to dedicate yourself completely to a company who does not value its employees nor do they fairly compensate. They give you no support at the store level and if you aren’t a part of the good ol boy click you are doomed!!
bad,Horrible company. Love the retail environment and loved the work I did but would not reccomend anyone who is a cashier or salary to work here. Assistant manager job would be the best thing to get if you work here
bad,Poor job security. Security is very much needed . Or more people working in a store at one time . To ensure that staff are safe every time they work .
bad,Have rules but no one follows and area manager doesn’t care to listen or follow up. I tried to dispute issues and went to HR and said area manager handled it. I saw him once in person and I was an Manager in Training.
bad,"One of the employee cussed me out all calling me B and H's because I wanted to count my drew. I call the GM to report it and she didn't do any thing about. Also they got robbed two times too."
bad,I feel like they dont care about my health my home life or really employees in general. All they care about is the bottom line. They say the customer is #1 but there is no recognition for customer service.  Bonuses and incentives are given to SM who have been employed with the company for a minute. But employees who have been with the company for years get nothing. I enjoy my job and the people i work with but the company could do better.I enjoye
bad,As a Regional CDL operator leave early in the mornings and work a 14 hour day.   I get to see my family Pretty much just on the weekend. Management tells you what you wanna hear but it’s not reality. Working in the trailer temperatures is like working in an oven or an attic.  You move anywhere from 35- 50k per day. 90% of the stores have an excuse why they’re not ready for delivery  and you have to do their job for you so you can deliver it in their store
bad,Expected to work off the clock to get the job done never really more than 2 employees at the same time customer service needs extreme overhaul. They do not care about their employees at all
bad,I was lied on smooshed in the door by the manager that had also lied on me reached out to the district manager who automatically made everything about my statement be wrong before reviewing the tape and the documents had to go to HR to resolve the whole issue it took about two and a half months total even after I requested to go to another store they still sent me back to the same store witwsame manager that light on me and swoosh me on endor
bad,"Dollar General does not support "
bad,Do not work here. Go find a job elsewhere. U barely get a day off without them calling you in. They write you up for every little thing. And will fire you quick quick without notice no matter how loyal or good of a worker you are
bad,Very poor management! They dont care about their employees. Most of the supervisors are not knowledgeable. Overworked every day. Pay not good. Do not recomend working here!
bad,"I personally think Dollar General is not a good company to be employed with! Like I stated above, they literally expect so much out of everyone, yet their pay is a joke! But the worst thing about them.. is the hours they give to their employees. I mean I literally had multiple co-workers who for the longest time, we're only getting 4 hours a week. It's ridiculous, who can really live on that?"
bad,"Could have just been management, I felt like I was on call for them all the time.I was Assistant Manager for more than a year, and every day Manager would call me in to work or call and yell at me because maybe every thing didn't get done...only 2 employees at at time, and you cannot leave the building even when punched out for lunch...I think is just wrong, needless to say I quit, a huge weight lifted off my shoulders."
bad,"At first u excited to work there but then is it's like unprofessional I have worked in a lot of companies but this was the worst management dont do their jobs always keeping up mess and that's in every store the try to set up fights , then they act like they in high school and no team and that's in every store then they have there favorite they be off most of the time and get a big check then the once that are actually there"
bad,They company only cares about making money. They treat their employees unfairly and are only worried about deadlines they only give you minimal train then fire or write you up for you not knowing how to do your job. They are one of the worst jobs I've had and I was a cna in an alzheimer's unit where I had combative patients.
bad,As a salary manager you’re expected to work well over your 48 hours a week. You’re told to stay in your store over night to work and stock even if you don’t have payroll for anyone to be there with you. The district managers really don’t know what they are doing and would rather stand around and look pretty than actually do work.They work the mess out of the salary managers and really do not care about wether or not they have family at home or kids they would like to spend time with. It’s crazy you are only allowed one day off a week and for the most part you don’t even get to take that!
bad,district manager doesnt care about employees. Horrible communication with employees. Employees expected to work open to close seven days a week no help given. Pay is minimal compared to other companies. Cant get breaks because of no help. Expected to work until you drop. Working injured is also required dont try and take off due to an injury.
bad,They dont care about your family. Schedule revolves around the manager. You dont get noticed for all your hard work. It like being back in high school...
bad,"Do not ever work for Dollar General! These people would make the founder of Dollar General roll in his grave. They suck so bad. I hated working there. The people inside you work with are great, it was the higher up people that are jack*sses."
bad,"Dollar General ruined my life and even when they were found to be wrong, they wouldn't humble themselves and say they were sorry and had made a terrible mistake in terminating me."
bad,"If you just want something to do and don't need the income, then you would probably be fairly happy.  Individual store management is extremely important in overall job satisfaction and employee morale."
bad,"can you live off LESS than 10 hr?????! Get real.  At least 10 hr needed.   you want to keep ppl then PAY ppl a decent hourly wage!!!!!  l loved the job, great manager. Excellent location."
bad,This is not for people who have responsibilities. The pay is poor and they always feel like the employees are stealing. I hate I every started here it was a waste of time honestly.
bad,Most of my co workers were nice. Everyone's experience will be different. My experience wasn't great therefore I don't have too much more to say about this company
bad,Hours were few. Manager was unpleasant. Low pay for the responsibility. Stocking while being required to check out customers was extremely hard. Store wasn’t clean.
bad,Nice for a first job but that’s it. Wouldn’t recommend it for anyone with children or anyone that wants a life outside dollar general. Customers are rude and racist.
bad,New district manager is terrible.  Has no balls and passes the buck onto others.  Hired without any Dollar General store management experience! Awful!
bad,"the actual job duties are very simple and tedious. it's the lack of structure within the company that makes the job hard. corporate is constantly looking outside of the company for regional and district managers rather than promote internally with long standing employees. lots of new people who don't know the business coming in with unrealistic expectations. corporate doesn't allot stores with enough hours to handle the work load. a typical store has six employees. the store manager, the assistant manager, one full and one part time key holder, and two sales associates. corporate allots about 108-120 payroll hours to stores which when broken down is about 35 hours for the assistant(at $10-$12/hr. $1400-$1600/month. $16800-$19200/year), 35 for the full time key holder(at $9-$9.50/hr. $1260-$1330/month. $15120-$12960/year), 25 for the part time key holder(at $9-$9.50/hr. $900-$950/month $10800-$11400/year), and a whopping 9 hours for each of the cashiers(at $7.75-$8.25/hr. $279-$297/month $3348-$3564). this makes it near impossible to have full store coverage (at least 2 people in store at all times) and productivity is low since (if they're anything but a cashier) employees will often work several hours if not entire shifts alone. of course the district manager still wants the work completed which causes most salaried store managers to work long hours (sometimes working double shifts) to meet quotas with stocking and standards of store cleanliness. as you can imagine many store managers don't do this as it's not only unfair in that in leaves no room for a ""work life balance"""
bad,"Horrible place to work, the mangers will scream in your face and yell if you are behind everyone else they dont even give extensive training . they let you do 4 days of training then your on your own."
bad,"The manager at the 7th street one is the worst ever. She didn't do what she expected of the employees, she treated everybody like crud, she was rude. It was a dirty store and only expected the other employees to clean and stock the shelfs. She never really helped. "
bad,"Old people that work at Dollar General complain a lot about cashiering. REALLY SMALL WAREHOUSE, you always must battle through to get where you need to go. Car pools are very frequent and isn't effective at all in the beginning of the month. Leading employers try to get attached to you and it is the biggest mistake if you fall into it. The management and ordering is absolutely terrible and never gets easier."
bad,"I hated it honestly. To many people throwing money and product at you, almost everybody was rude if you had to call a manager/key holder up to the front, and my manager always took her time coming to the front. I had to wait 5 minutes for her to set down some chairs and void something for me. You also can't go over $2 in your drawer or you're fired automatically. Plus, you're forced to stay at the job while clocked out until the manager is finished with deposit and that's 30-40 minutes AFTER you close and finish your mopping."
bad,"The hours suck, the pay sucks, gotta sell your soul for benefits, no future, no prospects. Its a job to get if there is nothing else and the one to leave for anything else."
bad,"This is a company with no structure, or consequences for bad/unprofessional behavior. The pay is horrible. This company has the potential to be great but as long as they keep allowing these unprofessional behaviors they will continue to have all the problems they have. Treat your employees better (pay rate )and it would get a better quality of people and wouldn't have such an extremely high turnover rate!!!"
bad,"DG would like to dictate how the stores run, but continually allow a subpar work environment. Employee turnover rate is extreme, cashiers are left on shift ALONE on a regular basis. Annual raises are a joke if you're in management. Lots of broken promises from up the corporate ladder"
bad,"As a Payroll Specialist you will need to answer 100's of calls a week from underpaid employees who waste no time in cussing you out with no manager interference. If you work hard the management is more then happy to give you additional duty after additional duty. The best way to maintain employment is to do the minimum asked, play dumb and answer no more then 20 to 35 calls. This is not a Payroll position but a call center job and you will be paid accordingly low base on the two other department positions that include Garnishments and Tax."
bad,The work life balance isnt there.  The company expects everyone ot be available every minute of every day at a moments notice and not consider a work life balance.
bad,"I left work at another company to come and work for Dollar General, I was quickly promoted to the company's version of a Shift Leader, called a ""Key holder""."
bad,"I worked here with an amazing boss. I love her still to death even after we both left that job. What was wrong was how things are run. Terrible working conditions and they didn't seem to care. You are overworked with less pay then someone that works the same in any other retail for the exact same thing. Try to avoid its not even a ""Try on"" job. Its a joke."
bad,My store went through three store managers in a few months. None of which were properly trained or qualified. The seasoned employees really helped keep the store running.
bad,as soon as you came in to work the manager would walk out the door wouldn't give you any notes the most enjoyable part of working their was helping the customers.
bad,The training was nonexistent. Computer based and then off to the races.  Work life balance? A manager who is understanding of specific situations instead of blindly vomiting corporate directives that don’t apply? What’s that?
bad,Worst place to work for. Very repetitive. Extremely low pay for the work; makes it difficult to have any drive or passion for the job. Don't get me started on management.
bad,"As I said the people I worked with we're all around nice, and friendly. Now I am unable to speak on behalf of other DG'S, but I know that at the one I previously worked at, over time was mandatory for key holders. Not just an occasional 12 hour shift, but daily 14+ hour shifts. I mean the money was alright, I'm being paid more now to clean up after people, so I can't say I'd go back or suggest it to my friends. May I also add that after I quit, giving a two week notice I began to here that my former manager began to spread ludacris rumors and slander. Very unprofessional."
bad,The company really doesn't want to pay labor to have a proper number of employees. The hardest part of the job is working with the public and the complete reliance on manager overrides to fix any small error.
bad,Dollar General is always hiring because most people start at minimum wage and with little to no room to grow.You can expect little as 12 hours a week to 40+ for minimum wage.
bad,Very unorganized and poorly managed. Doing the managers job and then reprimanded for your duties as key holder not performed. The Dollar General Corporation has no consideration for their employees or their families. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers and then meeting the new customers. Worked in a tourist area so we had many people from many different areas of the United States.
bad,"Hours they gave were not consistent. I was full time, yet hours were cut back to about 20 per week. The district manager did not want to pay me bereavement, but when I showed him policy stated I was suppose to get it, he made my job miserable there. They would make you work by yourself during rush hour. Then when customers complained about it, they would hold it against you. They played favorites. If you did not raise enough money for there charity they sponsored, they would threaten to wright you up."
bad,"I made $7.25 for a year here. One of the assistant managers was about to retire, it looked like I was going to get the position, due to the store manager saying that I would be in charge of it soon. They hired somebody from the outside to take the position. I do not recommend any work environment that does not allow for growth. Good coworkers, will miss some of them."
bad,"I was hired as a Store Manager Candidate and received excellent training from my assigned trainer, who was later promoted to a district manager. I started in July 2018 and was assigned my home store in October 2018, by chance actually. In the interim I was passed around from store to store helping on multiple projects. One of the largest projects I managed was closing a store that had been open in the same location for over 15 years. What a mess, but my crew and I sought our way through the chaos and successfully completed the liquidation with little to no supervision from the overseeing District Manager. I then moved on to new store set ups at multiple locations. Then October came and I was offered a store that was somewhat near my area of town. I thought, ""Great! I'll be centrally located. NOT THE CASE! I was handed a store that had been deliberately run into the ground based on situations that happened between management and employees of this particular location. Then the DM retired, would not support me in any situation. I was forced to clean up someone else's mess. Then it came time for the annual inventory and bonuses were going to be given out. It was my first store, my first inventory, and I had first time District Manager. This District Manager terminated me two days before the inventory, which cut me out of the bonus and essentially has cost me six months of being unable to find another job."
bad,"As a Lead Sales Associate, you're expected to essentially operate as a Assistant Store Manager without the pay of one. "
bad,"Get there and open up the store, turn off alarm. Open up the bag of Savannah newspapers and put them on stand for the day. Count down the bottom safe and make sure the change fund and tills are correct. Put out a secondary backup till myself and then i would assign the main till to my opening cashier. After the opening cashier arrived, we would pull all the displays for the sidewalk out and sweep the trash off the lot. At eight o clock we would unlock the front doors to the public when the store lights came on. We were in the dark until the store needed to be opened. I would bring totes for the cashier to work in between customers and I would vanish unless paged for the entire shift to throw stock all day until the next manager arrived."
bad,Dollar General is a place where you will work to death with no results or help. You are only judged on the negative and there is never positive feedback. It is a report driven company. you have little to no direction and the training is slim to none.
bad,I do not recommend working for DollarGeneral unless it's the only opportunity in your town. They expect you to be super-human.  the hours are given based on the bottom line and not the workload.
bad,"I went through three different managers in two months "
bad,Dollar General does not care how hard of a worker you are. Worked there for 4 years and had no problem with my schedule until we got a new manager. Dollar General will not work with your schedule. Hated leaving I loved my job but they would not work with my schedule. Its a shame they don't care about there employes its all about the almighty dollar.
bad,"If you work there you honestly can just throw your dignity out the window because upper management will if they find out you have any. Couldn't rely on new manager to give concise answers, acknowledge my grievances or even the basic respect of letting me finish a sentence. Lack of communication to employees with power drunk echelons who are extremely lazy and rude isn't worth 8.50/9.00 an hour."
bad,"I don't know if this is every store, or just the one I worked at, but it was atrocious. There were only ever two people in the store at a time; you and a manager. One or two of the managers were helpful, but the other one or two were nearly impossible to get ahold of when you needed assistance. When you had a good manager in there, you had a good day. But the inverse is also true. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock things, when you didn't know where anything was, and the managers weren't around to help you. I enjoyed talking with some of my coworkers."
bad,"If you like to work your tail off and seem to never get things done heres the place for you."
bad,"Never again will I work there. They treat employees like dogs, don't care if you have an emergency and won't pay anyone a decent wage. You basically pay them to work. Corporate greed is more important."
bad,"Super repetitive, stressful and no help from other employees whatsoever. Absolutely no training. They just throw you into it and expect you to be perfect."
bad,"Overworked, kept under 40 hrs a week unless your a manager. Corporate is completely cut throat. Funny how the minute my full time benefits started they find a way to fire you. I worked hard to get to that point and they dont care about anyone but themselves. My store managers were great but there is no rewards for your hard work, they will cut your your throat in the end. I would never recommend anyone to waste their time on Dollar General."
bad,"Your are expected to work 60-65 hours a week. As a salary employee you do not get compensated for working extra hours.  DM's do not care if you have worked 30 days open to close, you're the store Manager and its your responsibility. The turn over rate for store Managers is extremely high. Definitely no time for family life. You will be tied down to the store, and most of the time, you're in the store alone."
bad,"There is not one redeeming thing about working here. No benefits, terrible pay, terrible management. You will get payed pennies, to fix everything. Don’t expect the managers to help, cause they don’t know how to train new employees."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. You have commands coming from everywhere. No-one teaches you the correct way of doing things. They just want it done and when it's not right that's when you get ridiculed.
bad,Absolutely no communication or support from surrounding stores and District Manager. Many shifts I would work 15hrs all by myself without any breaks or lunches in a very high theft neighborhood. Training was useless and little desire from other to teach. Company wide issues with payroll and hours needed to work scheduled workload
bad,"The upper staff did not pay attention to there works. Staff would go to work injured or ill and management did not take it serious, the worker were still required to do there shift."
bad,"My most enjoyable part of the job was the customers!"
bad,"The company has made a lot of positive changes over the years I have been with them. Mission statement and the services they provide in chosen markets are positive. The very nature of the job can vary depending on store volume, location and demographic. Payroll allocation is questionable. A manager can work 45 hours a week with a day and a half off versus another manager could work 65 hours a week with no days off all in the same district for the same salary. I would absolutely love my job if it were not for the payroll component, but that is the trend in brick and mortar retail who answer to stock holders."
bad,"At the beginning i loved the job, but after about a week it was awful. Corporate will only give the store a set amount of hours to work (which is NEVER enough!) and then they expect you to to do way to much with the small amount of hours. if you can’t finish it then the manager has to, and there is no such thing as overtime even if you work it. don’t work here!"
bad,"The general manager I had, who I believe has since been fired, was terrible about picking favorites. She didn't like me, so she only gave me 10 hours a week, or less, and only once ever tried to carry a conversation with me."
bad,"Constant threats from upper management, if youre good at your job you get stuck with all the work, you dont have to be good at your job to be promoted which leads to bad or untrained managers, it is a nightmare, pay is bare minimum of what is average for position"
bad,Low pay. They chop time off your pay check because the company is so broke they can't even afford their own employees. They are a bad place to work. Ok?
bad,"The district manager was a very ugly people and would come in putting you down, never say anything positive.  It made it very stressful to work environment."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to someone trying to support a family. The job itself was very laid back, comfortable environment but the pay wasn’t worth going in."
bad,I worked 10-14 days a month with no sick days and no paid time off and no one can live off of what I made there. The manager was nice. Customers most the time were nice.
bad,"Have to get to work at least 30 (5:20-5:35 am) minutes early to get viable equipment for the job everyday. Management has their favorites and are overall childish in their demeanor to the employees under them. If you're a favorite you will be able to get away with about everything but if you have ever stepped on a managers toes they won't forgive. The coworkers I have are very immature and could care less if you are trying to get your job done the right way. In orientation they give a whole spill on how it's fast to move up, you get bonuses for little to no work, you get discounts on certain products, etc. none of this is true at all, most of the managers were picked because they were easy to teach, there is absolutely no room to move up due to favoritism regardless of the criteria you have met you will be looked down upon for even considering leaving the position you are put into (when you're put in a position out don't like you can either leave or get over it)  I've gotten one bonus since I've started and it was only about $50, incentive pay that is promised is near impossible to get everyday without cheating the system (which you will get fired for unlesss you are a favorite)  HR is unorganized and after you're 90 days you get a raise for passing probation and it took me another 2 weeks of working probation pay when I should've been paid full-time wages. And there is a ton more wrong with this backwards Distribution Center."
bad,"Poor upper management. Management has no consideration for your personal life. they consistently make false promises. The work you do will likely never be good enough, and if it is they will expect you to sign your soul over to the company. working off the clock is common, but they will claim they dont do that."
bad,"Worked at DG during college, you can advance quickly but the pay is a joke. Even the store manager at my store worked 60+ hours a week and made $35k. Not only is the pay low but the stores are always understaffed; there are only two employees on shift at any given time and it is simply not enough."
bad,"This job has wore my body down bad physically and mentally. There should be more advances, better work conditions, and last but not least, better pay! Experience and education should be recognized and awarded! I wouldn't recommend no one to work iside any of their stores. Corporate is who gets the paid vacations, etc.... It's very hard work to keep a store up and running. We don't get enough payroll hours and the turn over is very high because the pay is way too low and the work is too strenuous."
bad,"Dollar General is a horrible company to work for. The pay there was not good at all, if you got a raise which was rare, it was pathetic! They could never keep anyone because you were expected to do so much but was never given a reasonable amount of time to do it. You can never catch up and if anything went wrong during the day it would make you behind in everything else. Every time I was on my break i would get interrupted because there was not enough employees and someone would need help.you pretty much had to run all day to get anything done. the store never had more than 2 people in it at a time but so it was expected that those 2 people could get truck done in 2 days while one of them was running resister.  The company didn't give us enough hours to schedule people properly and with a result of that we could never catch up and we were always exhausted trying to do the of 3 people per person."
bad,"Our team started with a brand new store.  Our manager was great, our team was awesome.  The store was beautiful, but not in a very good area.  We were proud of ourselves for putting the store together.  We were proud of how clean and tidy everything was kept.  It was a great place to work.  "
bad,"Dollar General does not hire enough staff. The prices are great, but there never is enough staff."
bad,Ran on a skeleton staff. Very high workload and low compensation.  Unreal quotas. Store was too small for all of the merchandise that came in.  If one person called in you were stuck there from open to close.
bad,"As a part time employee I was able to receive benefits but your pay was minimum wage, which isn't enough to live on. I had a primary location I worked at but filled in at two other locations. One location the manager was not nice at all, but the other two locations the managers were great."
bad,"You have no work life balance. Working 6 days a week most days 10 to 12 hours. Lack of hours means you work alone a lot, Not enough hours to take a proper break. You are still expected to complete your everyday tasks and the multiple tasks you are sent from other management. The benefits are OK but you will pay a lot for them. Do not recommend working for this company THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THEIR PEOPLE."
bad,"During my employment as Store Manager with DG, the Upper Management had no respect for the one's who actually improved the Stores and worked open to close for months at a time.  DG does not focus enough on their employees and why their retention rate is so out of hand."
bad,"This is one of the few jobs I have had where the management is almost disconnected from the employees. You can expect to be treated as an easily replaceable individual on a daily basis. Also from 6 am to 4-6 pm you will be required to run at minimum 95% production rate effective as soon as your 90 probationary period is concluded.  Any production under 95% is a write-up. Seniority does not matter here, I have personally been working here for a year and a half and no leeway is permitted. So expect cut-throat expectations regardless of circumstance. The work culture here is almost shameful. Teamwork or collaboration is not going to be a part of your workday. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"The job itself is not hard as a sales associate, but the management was horribly unprofessional. The General Manager was not clear on training and would show favoritism. The particular location had too many manipulative workers and management treated workers unfairly. This job taught you how to manage a register strictly, how to stock and label, and how to help prevent theft of a store. The most enjoyable part were the customers who were regulars who came in and held conversation with you."
bad,"I was in charge of the front end: housekeeping, customer service, running registers. Management often came by to compliment our front end as compared to other stores. I left because the manager wanted to have relationships with their employees, even if the employee doesn't want to hear about their personal lives all throughout work."
bad,Dollar general is the best job to start at. Just don't get stuck there rise above it. Good side change but as far as beneficial no. they will work you like an slave while the key holders run and hide all day.
bad,"Dollar General is a good company,good managers with enough  time for lunch ,they focus on helping their customers and  employees is a fine place to work"
bad,"It was not a career and i did not make enough money for the hours i put in. There was alot of drama between employees, young high school kids. Never got a pay raise when promised."
bad,"These folks do not know what they're doing.  Lots of politics."
bad,"OVERWORKED & UNDERPAID. The District Mgmt & Dollar General Corp does not care about his/her employees. The most unorganized, disastrous mess I’ve ever experienced in my whole life. However, on a positive note I’ve met some great people along the way I worked with. As a leader, it’s truly sad they take great, hard-working people & drain them. Honestly, cameras are all around, the staff still feels they’re treated as thieves & criminals. I do not agree with how things are run as a whole. Dollar General has an amazing history & makes excellent sales it’s sad to see it go down this way. There are 2-4 stores in almost every city. It’s not personable nor worth the pay you get. I do not recommend working for this company. It was part time for me but I’ve overworked myself to the point of being dangerous in public society. Please think long & hard before making this decision. This is why the employee leave rate is so high. It’s ridiculous. No amount of money would ever keep me here."
bad,"The dollar general I worked for was awful, I would not recommend anyone to work there. Low pay, stressful, and hours were just ridiculous, up and down, randomly get 44 hours one week, then 17 the next."
bad,"You did everything that needed to be done that day for work and at the end, cleaned up for the next shift. Management was not the best. The hardest part of work was the higher up. They over worked you, and expect you not say anything, and if you did they will make you sound like you were the one that is in the wrong. HR is not great either, you went to them and if you said there was a problem, they would have no clue how to solve it, and just push you off to the side. You will never know what your schedule will be, one day you may work 8 hours the next 12+ hours."
bad,The Companys expectations far exceeds the amount of help the Stores have. The hours for Managers is too many compared to the salary you are on. The Job Expectation kept getting bigger with no more extra hours for your employees.
bad,for the amount of stuff you have to do while working there they only pay 7.25 a hour which now days you can't really even buy stuff from their own store!
bad,"20 billion dollar a year company which offers no incentives for long term employment. No benefits to speak of, not worth investing your future. Expected to work every Holiday, not a family friendly company. Unreliable pay week to week. If you are forced to work overtime, it will be taken away from you on Friday as they kicked you out and cut you hours. Health care insurance is over priced and covers very little, State run insurance is better."
bad,This company does not invest in it's equipment so that employees can deliver great customer service. Everything is ALWAYS broken or not working properly.
bad,"cutthroat everyone was talking about everyone and trying to get each other fired very small place, all you can do is restock the same thing you've been stocking. not many people work there so if you call out it's on you because no one can cover basically, also wasn't giving many hours and we get paid every week."
bad,The pay is not good and they only gave me a 50 cent raise in the 2 yrs that I have been there. Also they give no more than 25 hours even if full-time.
bad,I was unappreciated and bullied by my manager. No one in higher management would take the time to listen to me. I was not able to show my true potential because the manager didn't like me.
bad,"I worked there for 4 months. It was only challenging because of inconsistency in upper management, poor direction, and being understaffed. Almost ruined it for me liking retail."
bad,"Typical work day was 4-5 hours. They (management) expected you to get 2-3 rolltainers done, plus take care of customers, plus all your other duties. If not manager would yell at you even when off the clock."
bad,"This company and Family Dollar are the two worst companies to work for in the entire nation. Between the two companies, they put up more stores than they can ""afford"" to pay the employees to run them. Therefore all the salaried store managers get to pick up the hours that the company does not give to the employees with no benefit. If you want to kill yourself and forget what your home looks like this is the job for you!"
bad,The manager was undependable. My employees were lazy and did not like to work. The only part of the job I liked was setting up new displays in the store or reorganizing items.
bad,"I would never suggest anyone to work at Dollar General. The assistant managers get paid about 9.50 an hr. and everyone else gets way lower than that. They make 2 people run a store at night and its very scary. Dollar General has a high turnover rate of employees, and if one person calls off you better not have plans because they will call u in and then cut the rest of your hours for the week because no one gets overtime"
bad,I have had completely opposite experince working for the company. The first store i started at was great and had terrific and understanding managers. The second store however had a very unconsistent manager who only seemed to be concerned with themselves and not the well being of their employees.
bad,"The most hours I worked a week was 20 hours! I was only part time, but that wasn’t even paying my gas! I do not recommend anyone work at dollar General. They throw you on the register with almost 0 training."
bad,I really don't have a great opinion of the district I was in. Just make sure you ask the right questions before on boarding and joining. They pay well and a store manager position will work for you if you can work 50+ hours weekly.
bad,being paid salary sounds great until you are working 70 hours a week and only being paid for 40. the district managers expect you to work miracles and still be under payroll. they don't acknowledge any good that he store team does even though they are required to do so.
bad,"Good pay , but management is terrible , constant overtime , unsafe work environment, supervision is nonexistent, descent benifts,  and vacation time given ."
bad,"It's really hard work. You have to stock, bend over reach things, clean sky shelves, phone, register. Overall not the best place to work. Pay isn't that good."
bad,"Struggled to maintain a relationship with my boss. Not a friendly work environment and was very strict, therefore stressful. They did not follow my work availability."
bad,"Stressfull, unresponsive upper management, not enough hours to get job done, poor employee work pool to choose from because of pay but the most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to go home."
bad,"hard work for little pay and benefits. management did not care or about the store and the daily running. "
bad,just never work there it was a horrible work place i worked there for six years in when they feel like treating you like trash they do it i dont have to write i book i wold never go back
bad,"This company is clueless. They put incompetent people in charge, while overlooking loyal, hardworking, intelligent employees. They hire new store managers off the street, rather than promoting from within. Assistant managers get paid hourly, in the ballpark of $10.00 an hour. If they are lucky, they can get 38 hours a week. Health insurance is too expensive to be obtainable. No real time off, unless you want to schedule an unpaid day off. "
bad,The company in itself seems as if they do not know how to do anything except take money. Company does not appreciate anyone at store level and expects them to bend backwards and break their backs for minimal pay. Management seems to very by store and district. I learned a lot about how NOT to run a company. Most enjoyable part of this job is usually your coworkers.
bad,I did a lot of back breaking work throughout the day and sometimes it didnt seem worth my time and troubles. My feet hurt everyday when I got home. Everyone always called in so I would end up working their shifts as well.
bad,"Unless you can handle alot of stress I dont recommend it, also they can be extremely demanding in the hiring process not giving anyone the chance to work if they dont qualify to their standards."
bad,"Inconsistent and Rude District and Regional Mangers. "
bad,"As a working manager, i had little to no budget, with a well performing store. Having worked for other companies, i know the labor was 30-50% lower than any other company i have been at. With that, the expectation was that the GM, Assistant GM and Shift Leaders were supposed to do everything, and work more than 40 hours."
bad,"At first I did enjoy working for Dollar General. The hours were decent, and pay was good. Now it's not really the case. I have to look for another job because the company has cut everyone's hours. If you're not a manager, you don't matter to the company. Only assistant managers and cashiers got their hours cut. But I did learn how to rotate the expired for the new and to keep stock on the shelves."
bad,The pay for all the manual labor that you had to do was extremely low. You had to confront shoplifters even if you seemed your life was in danger. You did not get a discount and unless you were a manager you did not get hours at all. It is extremely hard to live off of a job like this. They were very inconsiderate of your time. They did not seem to care about their employees.
bad,"I left this job super fast because they set impossible standards on your work day and insist you come in early and stay late to get things done. Forget your life and family, you work for them now and they don't care."
bad,"You get paid minimum wage to do a lot of the work for the day. You always have to work the cash register if you're a sales associate, even if it is easier for you to stock."
bad,"I love the employees, although it's not much for advancement. I don't like working here buts it's a job, that partially takes care of family and home."
bad,It's a good place to work for there's always something new to learn and on top of that the people there were friendly and always willing to help the new employees
bad,A typical day at work was slow and what I've learned was nothing I already knew.the management was great the work place culture was natural the hardest part of the job was really easy the most enjoyable part of the job was at closing.
bad,"Not a very great place."
bad,"It was a very stressful job, with little free time and too much responsibility put on the two people working (since payroll was slim). Poor management in a poor neighborhood."
bad,I worked 4 years for them and no matter how much you fellow policy and procedures they will force you out but harassment or false accusations to fire you
bad,"From the beginning of your shift you're on the spot, busy with customers and many tasks to do. Employees safety is not very secure. Got paid 9 (as keyholder) and did tasks of an assistant manager, while on other places you get paid over 10 for simply being a cashier. Did not like the fact that the company does not want to pay over 7.25 for starting cashiers despite the fact that they are a very fast growing company and you have to do more than just the register, including keeping the store clean, and working the truck along with stocking."
bad,I stocked the shelves for six to eight hours a day. I could never keep up with the pace and I would always forget where some items went. It was just the same thing every day. Management was normally grumpy.
bad,Over worked and under paid. Wasn't treated fairly or with respect from the district manager. Not enough given to the store for the amount of work they expected to be done
bad,"It's fun to work at DG and especially when you make a costumer happy during their shopping time to check out. I do hate handling money in my life, it was first time to me as a cashier and I was proudly to say that I never had an over and short drower."
bad,"Profit driven,"
bad,My manager was great and helped when I needed it. The pay was horrible. The schedule was constantly changing and hard to have a outside life. The work enviorment was awful.
bad,"Worst job ever. If you are management avoid this place. I saw Family Dollar managers come over to DG and go back to Family Dollar within 6 months. No hours, an impossible workload, most of the time it is just a manager and a cashier. And when it gets busy I was a cashier with a huge workload."
bad,"Thought they would be a good idea, it was not."
bad,"As a manager they expect you to work 70, 80 even 90 hours a week. As a single mom this is not the job for you. You are not allowed to be able to go to your children's school functions because Dollar General thinks that they should be #1 in your life. Does not matter if your children are sick and need to be taken to the doctor Dollar General doesn't care. Expecially about your well-being as an employee. I was deathly sick and had a doctors excuse for work because I had bronchitis and I was forces by the district manager to work and she would not even try to see if another manager or assistant manager from another store would cover my shift."
bad,"This company does not care about your safety. We were robbed three times within four months and their solution to that was to add hours of operation. So we went from being open from 8-10 to being open 7-11. That money spent opening two more hours a day could've been spent on a security guard daily, fixing broken cameras, or adding security devices to merchandise. I will never work for them again because my life isn't worth 7.50 an hour."
bad,It was an okay place to work. It is really messy and I barley had any hours. The day there is usually busy. you would be surprised how many people come in everyday. Every Saturday I would work the manager on duty would always catch someone stealing in there which was crazy.
bad,"This job was a nightmare. Everything was systematic.  The only problem with that is there was no margin of error.  Everything was centered around the truck.  If you missed or were late on a date,  you would get buried  with little chance of recovery.  So if, for an example, an employee called off or quit, you would get buried."
bad,the district manager will make or break you.  mine was terrible. he was no help for anything.  absolutely an aweful person
bad,"The pay is very low, they will fire you for anything and everything. The people at my store were great mostly, but corporate policy leaves much to be desired."
bad,It's not worth you sacrificing your time and patience on because you will get burned out really quick. Most of the time the reason why workers stay is because of location convenience and possibly good staff members. In so little words Corporate asking for so much out of the team yet is sketchy with giving each store there appropriate hours to run the store successfully.
bad,Not enough register training given. I was thrown on register and left by myself for long periods of time..I had alot of problems ringing sales which also slowed me down ringing up  the customers. The store manager and assistant store manager were patient with me .
bad,products came off the trucks unorganized. more product was sent to the store than what possibly could fit in the store. Despite the teachings in the cbl's the expectations of what work was to be done contradicted each other. as explained in the cbl's the proper technique for put product on sky shelf or bing it down was unable to be fulfilled. Other staffing members where dishonest.
bad,"Dollar General was ok back in 2013. but the longer I was there the harder it got, I was running the store without a store manager for about 1 yr. and it was terrible. The gm wouldn't give help neither would the other stores that I would call and ask for help."
bad,"A typical work day I would clock in and morning shift would clock out, I would be working by myself for 1-2 hours by myself waiting for my cashier for the night came in. after they will clock in and I would be in the back doing stock while my cashier would be in the front doing stock as well."
bad,"don't treat their employees right.work managers 50-60 and pay you for 40.only give the sales associate24 hours a week than when they go out and find another job o make ends meet they want to fire them. The hardest part of the job was keeping the thieves out of the store than when we couldn't they would accuse the employees of stealing."
bad,"As with any retail job, the quality of the manager depends on who you get.  The work environment is inefficient as they will only allow enough hours to have two people take care of the entire store.  Unless you are a store manager, overtime is basically forbidden, and hours are guaranteed to get cut short at the end of each quarter.  Full time positions are nearly impossible to get, which prevents you from being able to accrue any benefits.  They say offer scholarships to employees, but those scholarships are only available to full time associates majoring in retail related fields at for profit colleges with questionable accreditation.  You can basically just watch customers just walk out the store, because between policy and fear for your own life there is nothing you can do.  They won't invest in security measures for all stores, and then blame the employees when there is nothing they can do to catch or stop thieves.  Computers do not function properly, and they are rarely bothered to have the bugs fixed."
bad,"Feel like management does not give enough credit for the hard working managers and associates to keep a productive workforce."
bad,"If you're lucky,  two people will be on a shift.  GM MUST work at least 6 days a week to hope to get required work done. (Unless you're ok with being in trouble w/distr mgr) Hiring  people to work for minimum wage....let's just say you get what you pay for.  If you DO happen to find someone who gives a hoot, you can only give 15-20 hrs a week. From Jan to July,  I had 11 days off."
bad,"The system that corporate expects managers to use does not work. They have a problem at the top and until that is fixed the turn-over rate will keep increasing. Also as a manager, you have to be willing to hire anyone because you can't afford to be short staffed for more than a shift. Also, they do not pay well at all. I ran a store and didn't even make $20,000."
bad,"Overall the Zanesville DC needs major mechanical work. The ""merge"" as its called frequently jams and gridlocks shutting down all conveyors. With the "" red prairie"" timed system all of these little shut downs are supposed to be inclusive in our time to complete tasks. IT IS NOT. We recieve no down time for these errors that are beyond our control and they are quick to boot you out for low production numbers. The management sweeps any issue with the merge under the rug and expects employees to be able to make up an hour or two of lost time due to the mechanical faults. Been told personally to break rules to help save time. The accident team is only there to team against you in the event of an accident to make it your fault and have seen someone break their leg and be disciplined for it. Rediculous rules and rediculous work conditions.  The only reason people stay is for the money. And honestly killing yourself working like a dog isn't worth it!"
bad,I've worked for Dollar general for a little over a year an a half. I've had 4 different district managers in that time. The company has a habbit of making mistakes and then shifting the blame the average associate leading to them quitting or getting fired. Middle management treats people like criminals and hard work goes unrecognized. In fact hard work (or smart work) for that matter is a waste of anybody's time here as they don't want to let go of their broken inefficient system. Lots of expectations and not enough hours given out to complete them. they expect miracles but give you less than the bare minimum to attempt getting them done.
bad,"Dm's DO NOT CARE if you fall behind or need help. When you ask for help, all they do is tell you to do better. They do not offer any assistance in getting caught back up. Bad job, Bad pay, Bad management."
bad,"Worked for Dollar General for a few years and found that the "
bad,"Bad hours, horrible labor budget."
bad,They do not treat there employees very well. There has been complaints from other past employees as well. They will not help you succeed in achieving advancement.
bad,"Set un realistic expectations then do not offer tools needed to achieve expectations. Mandatory work week of 6 days, Preach home/work balance but dont follow that motto. Continual payroll cuts making managers work alone for entire days."
bad,This job says with advancement they will provide you with training but that is a lie!!!!! I was promoted to store manager within a couple of months and when things were not the way they were suppose to be I got penalized for not knowing how to run a store.....I appreciated the pay raise but after I had workers comp surgery the true colors of Dollar General Management showed!!!!!
bad,"You couldn't pay me to work at this place again. See, the manager for the Hueytown store is a nice woman. Very lenient. Very quiet. I thought I was going to have one of the best managers. WRONG. The store is an absolute MESS. But every day that I worked, I'd try to clean it up a little at a time. Which is nearly impossible because once you get started on something, a customer is surely going to come up to the register. Then you, of course, have to stop what you're doing and do your REAL job. I was written up TWICE because I couldn't put out a FULL Rolltainer. It. Is. Impossible."
bad,"Horrific injuries happened weekly. DG is far more concerned with production than safety. They'll hire nearly any inexperienced kid with the ability to lift 50lbs. Corporate structure is ridiculous, and will happily and knowingly violate federal and state law in favor of their own policies. In six months, people lost toes, feet, and incurred terrible injuries.  The labor is so physically intense that most people quit within their first 90 days.  Most of the supervisors do the best they can with what their given, but that's not much."
bad,A typical day at work would be checking out costumers. I learned that not all stores have everything put together and organized. The management was poor because the manager did not like to do any work. I did not have but a few co-workers and they would always call in. The hardest part of the job was being in a work place where it is unorganized. The most enjoyable part was greeting the costumers.
bad,"Disorganized company to work for, inconsistencies with company rules. Lack of education equals poor management. Over worked, under paid. Dishonest upper management. Not all store managers are team players. Increased wages means less hours worked."
bad,"My fellow employees were great and so was the direct management (Store Manager/Assistant Manager) but the higher ups made us feel like used, cheap computer parts."
bad,this a place for someone looking to make extra money to supplement another income.  Odd hours  No break room area .No employee discounts
bad,I would not recommend Dollar General because even though they promote work/life balance it is not always a way to do that especially if the District Manager is not willing to help. It is also an unfair environment when it comes to HR and issues within the store HR will not investigate your best interests only the interests of the District Manager or Regional Manager
bad,A typical day at dollar general is hectic. Call ins happen about 4 days out of the week. The management is horrible. Customer service sucks. My day consisted of stocking and cleaning up the store. I also did the deposits hired and fired people. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. My favorite part of the job was stocking the store and resetting planograms.
bad,"Even though I worked for Dollar General for a week and a half, it was my first job and I wasn't trained right or properly. I was left alone on the cash register within the 30 minutes of my first day, and I had a lot of problems I came across with that. My manager wouldn't understand that I didn't work anywhere else before, and I was just a babysitter. To my next employer, I'm telling them that I didn't work long at Dollar General, because one person didn't take time to talk to me and explain where the items are in the store, so that I could tell customers where to look. The assistant managers were great to me, and they took time to be considerate."
bad,Very dirty no matter how many times you clean. The companies policies don't make sense usually and they very rarely fix anything that is broken and they insist on not upgrading their computer software to make things easier and faster for their employees and their customers. I believe this is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Most of my co-workers are very nice and we get along find including my manager but I don't agree with the way corporate runs things or their disregard for their staff and customers.
bad,"Typically my day would start at 6 am to 4-5pm, 6 days a week, co-workers were great, my supervisor was very nice, hardest part of my job was I tried too hard"
bad,i  understand this might just be this dollar general but absolutely horrible non stop stress on store manager (me) not enough hrs to get anything done yet i end up working 56 hrs a week? no support.
bad,70+ hours a week equals less then minimum wage. No family life and upper management uses people and steps on them to get what they want.
bad,This company is not a good place to work. The managers are too understaffed for all the work that is expected to be done. Sales associates end up doing managers jobs.
bad,"The new manager does not lead by example, which makes a workday difficult. She talks to employees like a dog, there is little respect there. Employees are told to disregard company policy, and do things that could legally get them into trouble."
bad,"very stressful workplace, no incentives, never do enough."
bad,Store Manager and Asst.manager were friends and played favorites...Store manager quit one night...3 weeks later he's brought back by the DM after the whole store turned things around for the better....not much respect for the DM after this
bad,Everything I was promised was not true after I started.You will work 6 days with no work/life balance and if short staffed you will work 7.The pay is low and if you don't bonus your staff will be making more than you after you average out your hours.Be prepared to work long shifts alone because they give you very limited payroll which is a hazard and makes it very easy for thieves to roam freely.They start pay at minimum wage so you will constantly lose people for better pay.This is a good starter job for student but move on after you get some experience.The only thing I'll miss are the customers.It's no surprise 90% of these reviews are former employees I should have read these before applying.
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. "
bad,"expect alot of work in a little time with no offer of extra time to finish."
bad,"Stores exist in a continuous contingency mode. There is ALWAYS some project that must supersede whatever it is you are currently working on. Usually this means dropping what you are doing to make the store look like the monthly magazine. However, you are usually without the manpower, hours, or resources to do it properly. So you must generate on the fly modifications to make what the store actually has mesh with what the corporation thinks you should have. "
bad,Lack of communication and nobody willing to take responsibilities for the things they say and do
bad,"If anything goes wrong, management assumes that it is you, the employee's fault. Lucky if I worked 1 day a week as well."
bad,The worst job I have ever had by far. I work 1 day a week for over a month. My store manager was so rude to customer.
bad,not a good place to work  always rushing to get stock put away  dumb hours under paid poor management   manager did not split nights up like she was supposed to  not good for a family person to work not enough help   just a bad place to work
bad,wasn't enough forklifts for everyone and I couldn't continue on production pay and make money.
bad,The typical day one could work over or go to another department.
bad,Have the freedom to create a good environment. Company tends to shift priorities at a rapid rate.
bad,This the most stressful and demanding place to work I have ever worked at. Everyone does not go by the same rules. Could not even get vacation without a fight.
bad,"They work their employees to death with very little pay and treat them with very little respect. Once worked 21 straight days without a day off only to get screwed out of my EARNED vacation pay. Not to mention they treat all their employees like their thieves and will even tell you all your employees steal on your orientation day. I was lucky enough to have solid sales growth, very little shrink, and 0 turnover in the 2 years I was there. After handling most of the products, I wouldn't shop there."
bad,"While working there I was paid little and worked a lot of overtime, however, I didn't get paid for overtime. The management would doc my pay so that i wouldn't be paid for anything over 40 hours."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are totally on your own, no communication from upper management at all, however that is also the hardest part of the job."
bad,They expect you to work very hard and the pay is not good.......in management you get very little time with your family. They expect you to be at Dollar General's beck and call. They let you know that you can be replaced. I don't think I have ever felt so unappreciated. Salaried workers are needed to work over their hours constantly but if you need to be off for illness or injury forget it. There is no discount and only 2 paid holidays.
bad,"The company used to care about it's people in the stores. Now all the company cares about is sales. Yes, sales are very important but when you want the best sales and nicest stores from your people you have to care about the people working for you and treat them with respect."
bad,You are expected to do everything with no help or compensation for your efforts
bad,"Unreasonable expectations from upper management. Worked stretches of 14, 17, and 22 days without a day off. That about says it all concerning this company."
bad,"Management would leave the store, along with her duties with me to go, for example, wash her daughter's hair. The schedule was never made and I never found out what my work schedule was until the end of the night for the next day...which left hardly any time to plan for a babysitter or any other event."
bad,"No support from upper management for store managers, so they are ran ragged and don't have time to handle important things.  Outdated registers that will crash when someone enters their phone number for their downloaded coupons."
bad,They should take better care of the employees that actually stick around.  Maybe then the stores would be run better. Pay is so bad no one stays.  They need to rethink being open all day on holidays too
bad,SM or GM are really overworked! Stores never have enough hours to cover task or staff to support the store manager. Stores become a total mess because of this
bad,The dollar general I worked for was a small store. But our store manager was a moody older woman. I tried my best to get along with her but it was futile.
bad,A good job . Can’t grow too far in the company. Great part time positions. Co workers are great and friendly with open welcome arms. May positions and roles to play at dollar General . Good job
bad,First off 7.25 is not enough for anyone to live off of second clocking out at 9:15 at night is fine but I refuse to work after I clock out and I never got enough hours never more than 15 hours a week most times less
bad,"They let anyone be a ""manager"", understaffed & under paid if u ask me. Hours were given to favorite employees, i liked the job. But others made it difficult to work. Nasty attitudes. I was suspended for a call off & never was called back"
bad,"I was denied proper training, nothing with Upper Management is kept sacred, and denied advancement due to disability. I had to miss work due to a death in family and they were mad they had to cover for me"
bad,"Although you can move up quick, it's not worth it. I was once promoted after only being there for months, only got a $1 raise and worked more than 40 hours a week every week. There are only usually two people there at a time. Sometimes you have to open up the store and be there for the first two hour by yourself. The customers are sometimes nice, but most of them are incredibly rude. The management is terrible. The district managers are also terrible. Only work their if you're retired but need a little extra money, or if it's a last resort and you just NEED a job."
bad,I really loved this job and was a key holder. I was fired by a district manager which had never worked with me and couldn't even pick me out of a line up and when we went to court he couldn't even tell them why he fired me I will my case of  wrongful termination. He later was fired but the management team has room to improve.
bad,"Too many turnovers in management, not enough work hours per week,no staffing 2 stock,clean or properly service the customer, stock is automatically sent limited staff per shift,store is isles are cluttered with stock and carts,floors are filthy"
bad,Store manager is untrustworthy and doesn't have any respect for employees and plays favorites. He hired his roommate after I was hired and gave her my hour's.. he made excuses as to why he cut my hour's.
bad,Sucked.managers left cash deposits out on register over nite in front of the ecite door and laughed about it the next morning. Unloading trucks were very hard. And pay wasn't goid
bad,A company that doesn't follow it's own rules and procedures or anti-discrimination laws. I would not recommend anyone to apply to this company. They don't listen to anything their employees below district management have to say. They claim to offer world class training but refuse to give you any. My district manager is attempting to get rid of the male store managers and replace them with females no matter what it takes or what lies have to be told.
bad,i went on workers comp de to a workplace injury which resulted in me having a cast.When they put me on light duty per doctors orders i got into a car accident and they removed me from workers comp and light duty while i was still in a cast and expected me to work full duty lighting 30lb-40lb boxes all night on 12 hr shifts
bad,Dollar General is a good place to work for if they hired people who were good people and didn't hire people who dont care about the job. They will hire anyone know matter who it is or how they are. They wont work with you on any schedules. And they cut your hours left and right and barely give any hours. Instead of giving people hours they will hire people and cut your hours when you need them. Management is careless and dont care about their good employees
bad,"The stock comes in mislabeled. Corporate thought it'd be no big deal to change the truck day on us without notice. The pay is awful. The stores are constantly understaffed. And these are all just off the top of my head. My advice, unless you're desperate like I was, do not work here if you can."
bad,"The female manager at Blackburn rd DG  was given my 2 week notice in Feb. 2017. She purposely""lost"" it. causing me to be a no call no show.poor management"
bad,I loved being a general manager for Dollar General just couldn’t get the help from my area manager to get on top. They put me in the worst store 07525 which was horrible and I had been a fast food manager at the time with no experience in retail even got a store manager from Arkansas to help me try to catch up but she could only come 1 Day.
bad,Dollar General is a place for students. The particular manager I had did not like me due to her son in law being one of my close friends. So she made it hard for me.
bad,The manager just never wanted to fix things that were broke that needed fixed in order for us cashiers to do our jobs and it made our job harder to do and frustrating and they never scheduled enough people to work and wouldn't allow anyone to pick up hours to help either.
bad,The store was a mess and the management was vindictive and spiteful a very harsh environment very high Tension I was treated unfairly and felt very unappreciated
bad,"This job isn't for someone with kids"
bad,"This job is one of the most low paying jobs I have ever had. I love my customers and that is the only reason I am still with Dollargeneral. The new management at this location is not good in my opinion. When I first started though, the manager was great and supportive of all her employees and super understanding and caring. The new manager is not like that at all."
bad,"Dollar General waste of money is RIDICULOUS. They spend so much money on recruiting, interviewing, hiring,training managers. They have accepted losing a third of their managers EVERY YEAR! They never give the store manager enough payroll to properly run the store. They are so engulfed in saving money on payroll both the store and it's customers suffer."
bad,"This was a hard fit for me, I worked here twice thinking that the expectations  has changed. The management had little concern for employees.  No flexibility. Treating the staff like 2nd hand people."
bad,Never accept the key holder position. Under paid. Always called in even if you already have plans. Got called in during a party. Called in cuz management didn't want to work. No benefits. No paid holidays.
bad,It was ok working there for a while but after a few weeks there you would be ready to go they called me in on my off days etc the pay was not good at all
bad,"Not a great place to work.  It wasn’t like this years ago, but I is now. You work many hours and the job is thankless. It matters who you work for and who you work with. Teamwork is a joke. Your peers are so competitive that it’s hard to form bonds within your Region."
bad,They will fire you over nothing or try to say you were stealing from the company when you didn’t. If you have health issues might as well not work here it is a joke.
bad,"I worked as a store manager. The pay was fair but the responsibility was extreme. Training was fast, and more like a sink or swim tactic. It was hard to keep staffing because anyone hired has to pass a drug test, backround test, and make minimum pay while working alone and having a large amount of work to complete. The area manager was a rude woman who only cared about numbers and not her staff. She did not have integrity."
bad,"work was steady,alot of times loads where not ready,had to wait for hours,rolltainers always overloaded with bad wheels,then expected to roll out of truck unload and push uphill ramp into stores,some over thousand pounds,not for the old or weak,most stores are not ready when you show up,all round bad experience!"
bad,"Was assured would get 20- 25 hrs a week. Got 10hrs. Wanted full time 32hrs. Manager did not register money network account. Such low pay, didn't need it I guess."
bad,Dollar General does not care about their people. How do you not offer your salary managers sick days? Also only one day off per week. Your job is never done.
bad,"I don’t recommend this company. I worked in 2015, left and then came back in 2019. Nothing has improved. The company is about their money. Backrooms are cluttered."
bad,"Policies are not enforced, the company doesn’t give employees the resources to do their jobs, and those who do work for them are under-appreciated. Equipment is old and the company refuses to fund any upgrades nationwide. Communication with upper management was a joke and you will be ignored. Four months is all I was willing to endure before moving along to a better employer."
bad,"If you are just starting a career in management this place isn't bad. If you have any experience and are good at retail management, stay on the job search and stay clear of Dollar General.  You will only be wasting your life with this company."
bad,"Salaried mgr coming off a 64 hr wk performing stock work for 95% of those hrs, I get terminated after my AM walks off the job wknd before. She's on camera bagging damages, her daughters GF walks out the store with them! 5 wks, nothing done. she files HR cmplaint I'm gone in 3 days"
bad,"Given the same routine; customer service, recover, clean assigned sections, and at times other duties assigned. I learned to work under-pressure, be fast on my feet and quick thinking. Management was to hard to deal with simply because manager didn't understand situations wasn't help when needed; passed his time out of store and when he's was in he would sleep in the management office, but other than the manager everyone got along. The work place environment was friendly and understood the need for help when given. The hardest part of the job would be when we'd have the store very busy we won't accomplished the goals due to the lack of help. In contracts, I'd really enjoyed friendly and kinded hearted customers that made my day/nights they gave us smiles when needed."
bad,Horrible work experience. District management is a joke. One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing. District follow up was a horrible experience for a manager to deal with.
bad,Store managers are left to play the hunger games you get no support from upper management  you are left to work open to close 7 days a week if need be and you have no home life and what time you are home it’s constant phone calls and griping from the district level. They are never satisfied with any good results you may have. Just an overall negative environment.
bad,"At the location where I worked, there was a lot of turnover and a lack of knowledgeable management to train employees. This is the main reason I left."
bad,I’ve worked there for 11 years and got fired due to know warnings and etc... I want refer a person to work there at all ... good luck to those that are there...
bad,"Working at the entry level is by far the worst position. A minimum rate of pay that often requires the same amount or more work than a manager. A Third Key Management position is ideal, less time on register and more time working with freight. Any position higher requires a complete dedication to the company with little difference in compensation."
bad,Over worked and underpaid.  No regards to outside life.  Hours were constantly being cut.  It would be much better if they offered more money being that this company is always opening new stores.
bad,between customers you are expected to stock shelves and are timed for what you do. Sometimes this is impossible . You are always being called to work on your day off
bad,"First and foremost; Dollar General's pay scale is way to low given it's competition pays $1-2 more an hour at every level of the hourly pay grades.  Second; severely short labor allotments means there is not enough hours necessary to complete required tasks, which creates a stressful environment.  Third; the company also has a culture of lack of trust in it's associates, which is quite evident in the training programs and company postings in the breakroom.  To restate:  Walmart is the same job, less stress, more pay,"
bad,They don't like to train.  You will need to hire employees but you will not have the man hours to do so unless you have a high volume store. This is a bad place to work.
bad,"manager leaves u onsite by yourself, constantly puts blame on workers, after computer training hands on training is very limited, manager will pick sides, and very messy"
bad,"I loved the management where I worked, but the pay was terrible. I get paid more now working at Dairy Queen than I ever did at Dollar General and hours are the same if not less. Stressful environment at times and not enough employees during shifts"
bad,The company accusses the employees of stealing but can watch 15 people on camera walk out if the store. Plus we aren't aloud to do anything about it which is stupid.
bad,"They fire people left and right, for no reason whatsoever. Its just fun for them to let people go. worked there for almost a year, and was let go because they made up a false claim that i did something i didnt do"
bad,"If they would stop building stores every five miles they might be able to staff the stores that are already up and running. They pay you basically nothing and expect you to work like a dog. I worked there for a little over two years and I can't even tell you how many employees came in and out of there. I had seven managers, just in those two years. Maybe it was just the store I was at, but I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,"I""m gonna be 100% honest, don't waste your time working here.You're going to suffer, because you're only ever going to be working with one other person, and when they go on break, you're by yourself. And the scheduling is complete nonsense. On top of all of that, the pay is not worth it in any position. The only good part about working here was the hard-working manager, and the other co-workers, because we suffered together, and we bonded because of it. Here's a list of other bad points of working at DG:"
bad,"Company doesn't care about the people at the bottom who work in the stores. They want so much for such little pay. Stores gets robbed and company doesnt do anything about it. All they worry about is the money.  District managers suck,  they think they know everything because of their title"
bad,I love a few of the people I work with but they don’t pay enough for the work we do that’s why I’m looking for a new job However they are flexible hours
bad,I ended up leaving the company due to lack of management. In one year the staff changed often. We were without a store manager for months and getting paid was sometimes a hassle.
bad,"You get poor training,  if you don't succeed in a few weeks they will get rid of you,  either finding away to make you want to quit or they fire you. Not work/life balanced."
bad,"Sometimes slow with nothing to do or busy with too much to do."
bad,"Working with my employees was awesome, it was upper management that need fixing and retraining classes. Very poor communicating with their employees and very disorganized."
bad,"Claims of ""family first"" only meant if it was hers. My DM had all her favorites that she catered to but if you weren't a suck up, you got left behind. No assistance, no support, no consideration  what so ever. There is very good reason that store cannot keep a manager."
bad,"The money is not worth the stress, micromanaging, high demands, and general dismissive nature of upper management. Management will nag, berate, and belittle you until you either reach a breaking point or you submit and do exactly as you're told. You are not encouraged to use unique managerial methods, and your integrity will consistently be questioned if you fail to meet the ridiculous requirements of the job. You are salaried as a manager, so expect to be in your store 6-7 days a week for a minimum of 10 hours a day. Upper management seems to thrive on questioning your character and abilities instead of offering genuine support and assistance to assure you are maximizing your abilities as a proficient manager. Their open door policy is an absolute joke, so expect any and all complaints you have of the company to be misconstrued and turn against you."
bad,"Poor hours"
bad,"Appied to work one area with they starting pay but soon as I start, they lied and put me somewhere else with a less pay. They inspect you to hit a certain percent and keep up with everyone when most items are heavy, most the time you don't the help when needed and get behind on work. Communication with managers are weak; you have to stay on most of them if it's person to make sure it get done or it will effect you big time. There's too much favoritism between current employees and managers that's been there longer; they would make new hires/temps do all the work while the others decide if they want to help or not; but they honestly really go wondering off doing what ever they want without getting in trouble."
bad,The management is good but the pay is not good at all. For all the work that you are required to do you are payed poorly. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public
bad,"Low wages for employees."
bad,"The management was very lazy. I was often told my schedule a couple hours before I was expected to go in. Regional management seemed careless about the associates. Our manager was slow to create schedules, list weekly or even monthly goals, and often blamed the clueless attitude of new employees on their intelligence while forcing same new cashiers to skip their Computer Based Learning an miss the important information it gives. I am not over exaggerating. This was done to save on labor hours. New workers were put on the register on during the training period and were instructed to let the nonskipable CBL videos play while they were dealing with customers. The job was pretty easy despite this huge pitfall. The main problem was that our tech support could not be reached 90% of the time. One of the two registers was down for nearly an entire month. Our phone was disconnected for 3 weeks. I cannot recommend this work to anyone looking for a career. This job is for high-school students who are still supported by their parents but want spending money, not for those who depend on a job to support their household."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked.  Dangerous, no stability, and clueless supervisors. Management only cares about reports. Terrible! Employees shortcut things because of management write ups on percentages."
bad,"I only stayed as long as I did for my coworkers, corporate  is horrible and have no idea what is really happening in they’re stores or what they need. Give you no time or payroll to fully staff the store, it’s only you and one other person most the time.  hours get cut constantly. "
bad,"Quickly growing company. As long as they continue to open 1000 stores a year, they will be able to keep jumping the shark and keep Wall Street happy.  Unfortunately, in growing so quickly, they are ignoring their infrastructure of people, facilities, training, processes.  I believe that this will come back to haunt them."
bad,You can advance really fast with the company If you're a hard worker. It also depends where and who you work under for ths job to actually not be bad.
bad,Not enough hours to support the customers or the stores. Managers are overworked and under-appreciated.  DM's struggle to complete their jobs as they are required to do the store's work.  LP is there to justify their job and not to support the betterment of the store.  HR is inconsistent and changes too frequently.
bad,"The management bad mouth every employee and costumers.  They have poor people skills. ( Coal Hill, Ar) I would Not recommend working at Coal Hill Ar Dollar General to anyone."
bad,I am not saying all dollar generals are bad just the wine in West union Iowa. The management has been written up several times for a laxed perform e but has yet to be fired.
bad,I applied for this job thinking that it would work around my school and they did that but they constantly said that I was going to be hired on as a full manager (I have 10 years of experience in general management) and then hire some 17 year old girl to do it that had no experience at all and mind you I'm only 24. I see exactly what happened here and I'll never in my life give them my business ever again!
bad,"I worked there for one week before I walked out. They want to pay you minimum wage for you to stock 6 hours a day everyday, you were hired as a sales associate at minimum wage which would be fine if you ran a cash register all day. Instead you stock hundreds of boxes a day a job that should pay a minimum of $9 an hour"
bad,The manager I had was messy like a female and he made the work experience so bad. I would recommend a high school student cause you don’t get hours and you cannot make a living with this job
bad,Working at dollar general it's fast paced. You have to be on the move at all times making sure things are done in a effective manor. Be able to help customers find the items they need and want.
bad,"Dollar General is an awful place to work. The upper management is constantly changing. They don't pay well at all, especially given the current job market in west Texas."
bad,The Dm was rude and very disrespectful to the employees and always wanted to change things but never did and would get mad when it wasn't done. Thought all the employees was stealing.
bad,"Stated they offer competitive wages and best training around. "
bad,"Customers were the only good thing about this job. Management was very poorly, if you didn't do everything that is delegated to you, you will be written up in a heart beat. The manager would speak horribly about another employee to another, which I found in poor taste. This has caused me to never ever work for this company again."
bad,I started working for Dollar General in March In Beeville Texas I started on a Saturday and everything seemed okay at first but then everything went to sh**t management in the store does not know how to run the store I'm sitting with the company but I transfer to another location because of management there sucked everyone that was a key holder thought they can do whatever they want I started in March and we are now in November from the time that I was there the store  must have lost maybe like 15 employees people would apply and quit because of the attitude that the manager had I don't recommend anyone to apply to the store because they expect you to do everything in such a rush I'm at a new store now and the environment is completely different the manager is very friendly and talk to you professionally and doesn't talk to you like you're stupid and they don't expect you to do the impossible to anything and everything from stalking and blocking to Recovery in the store to mopping the back of the store in front of the store and the warehouse a lot of the things were out of date in that store and the manager always gave the customer that she knew discount
bad,"dollar general uses a very little percent of there budget for labor, as store manager you you are required to work 50 hours a week but your salary is based on a 40 hour work week and you will find yourself there 70+ hours a week"
bad,"supervisors lie daily about how long youll be working for the day, they continue  threating to fire you with write up's for not working as fast as they want you to. you work 12 hour+ with only two 15 min breaks, with a production system designed to make you shorten your breaks so you can make there insane production, which has no incentive.  you start a 14$ a hour but you soon began to see that the work isnt worth it, if you join this company do not go to first shift, they are treated poorly, and made to know that there expendable. also the warehouse is infested with rats."
bad,"At the distribution center, the management is horrible. They look down on the hourly paid employees and only do nice things for the salary employees. Yes, the pay is good because you are guaranteed pay increases...well if the HR reps don't forget to do it each week."
bad,i didnt like my job very much spent more time in court for shop lifters than i did working they dont care about your personal safety no matter what you are suppose to be there to work
bad,Management very unorganized. Don’t feel safe in many of the locations. No security. Very low pay. Not enough hours. Promotions are rare but easy when they come around because employees are scarce.
bad,"You'll work yourself to the bone while shareholders and corporate employees reap all the benfits.  It's retail - Upper management doesn't care about you.  We used to close a few hours early on holidays.  Now we are open all holidays (except christmas day) from 8am to 10pm in most stores.  Forget having holidays with your family.  Most people don't realize how physical it is.  You're not just going to stand at the register all day.  You have to stock, do planograms, clean, check in vedors, etc. in between customers.  If you're a glutton for punishment this is the place for you.  Otherwise, stay far, far away!"
bad,"The overall work environment was horrible, not because of the work, but because of the culture of the people that worked there."
bad,"The one in Aurora, Colorado is horrible. Always getting robbed and management never cares. You are over-worked. Poor management so employment is not recommended."
bad,"We had some trouble getting the truck roll-tainers stocked and off the floor. My store manager had asked the district manager for help for over two months before things went downhill. We had so many roll-tainers on the floor that customers could not get to the thing they needed/wanted, and would sometimes yell at the sales associate on the register for the mess. We tried to get it as neat as possible considering the circumstances."
bad,"I personally did not like the management culture at Dollar General. They have poor managers, and as soon as you walk in the door you are just a number not an employee.  They are number driven so they can get their bonuses.  You get one week of training if your lucky and then you only hear from your manager if you are doing something wrong, in which you are written up for it. The hours are long, all overtime is mandatory.  You are there until the work is done, and if it take 13+ hours, you work the hours.  The work could only take 2 hours, and you are required to come in and waste gas to work 2 hours. The managers there are very poor, and cannot relate to workers on a personal level.  If you need a day off and it is denied, you will have to call in, take a point and an unpaid day.  They have a horrible attendance program and an even worse call off system.  They have a high turn over rate because the hours are long and the work is tedious and the management sucks.  If you want a horrible warehouse job, this is the place for you.  The only thing that makes up for it is the pay."
bad,It’s not a good place to work I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for this company they don’t pay enough and you don’t get that many hours maybe 30 if your lucky
bad,"HR sucks lack of communication lots of Favoritism by Management good benefits, great Employees need to make second Shifts that they game up all the work is put on  first shift"
bad,My experience was good at first I loved the customers and I loved doing stock on the weekend it gave me a chance to be in my own zone which I love. The pay was horrible it should only be used for part time purposes it is not enough to support a family.
bad,"They make it seem like you will be able to have time off.  My phone was constantly going off as soon as I left the store, because they wanted you to get people in and that way you are staffed.  DM never did any interviews, just sent people through all the checks and people were made if you didn't hire them.  Had to work a lot of long hours and never compensated.  Their employee discount was once a week 20% off one time purchase for all DG items you wanted on that 1 transaction with a few free items here and there.  It was not worth my time or energy anymore.  I got too stressed and had too many health issues come up during my work time there."
bad,"For the company being country wide with an exceptional amount of income, they have no benefits nor do they provide any type of pay raises unless you have worked there for a year. I was working four stores voluntarily for minimum wage ."
bad,"I have witnessed Dollar General fire a few people right before there retirements and paid vacations just so they don't have to pay them."
bad,I was a store manager for Dollar General for almost 2 years I put in over 50 hours a week and nothing ever seem to get enough for a district manager or Regional they expect you to give anything and everything you've got with no recognition or anything in return all I was ever shown was that everything that I did for this company was never enough nor would have ever been enough.
bad,"They talk a good game and the money is a big lure.  Unfortunately, if you are in store management, the hours you must put in works out to being paid less than minimum wage,"
bad,If you cant keep up they kick you out . mgr allows employees to do things that violates co. Policy but then when dismissed from job is not there to stand up for you.  No team players
bad,"As a Manager you have no life outside of work. DG says its manager's fault. But expectations and staffing and work load issues prevent a Manager from having a life outside of work. Pay is not enough for work required and upper management  is not willing to help struggling stores.  If your store numbers are up beyond a certain percentage you get a bonus, but some store managers will never see that bonus due to previous management shrink. All your doing is trying to fix and make up for their poor management and theft.  So you bust your butt and have no family life for poor pay. Turn over is ridiculous because of pay."
bad,"the most basic, simple, but sometimes illogically done retail setup.  The cash register is the worst part of the gig.  Do your surveys people! Especially if you have a nice cashier.  That stuff counts."
bad,"Dollar General does not have a work family  life balance for Store Managers "
bad,"Dollar General sold great products at a discount price. DG did not take care of the managers or the team from a pay standpoint and from a safety standpoint. they work the teams like they were mules. as a DM i felt so sorry enforcing their policies due to the emotional stress that was forced upon them. not a company to be proud of, in fact that's how DG made profits, working the team so hard and not allowing enough labor to clean, recover, or stock the stores. that's why when you enter a DG it's so filthy. this is not a way to grow the brand."
bad,Other than the customers becoming friends over my year and a half of working there the company is horrible. Far too many politics for such low pay....
bad,"Did not care for this job. Work way to hard for very little pay. Manager was great. Always understanding and hard working, but there was no room for advancement at this location at the time."
bad,"I was ASM at a high volume store when i started we had no manager  but we had wonderful associates great customers! It was a fun enjoyable work environment. Untill we got a new manager who was extremely young, inexperienced, unqualified, rude and disrespectful to both employees and customers! Quickly we stated to lose both! The store became a stressful and anxiety ridden nightmare where you were overworked, underpaid, unappreciated and replaceable!"
bad,"DG works the good, hard working people almost to death and rewards the underachievers.Very stressful place to work. I was on 4 different blood pressure meds at the time, surprised I didnt have a stroke or heart attack."
bad,"Putting stock away was the eastest to do the the register was easy to "
bad,The district and Regional managers only care about the work being done and not its associates. They under pay associates and do not abide by the overtime /working off the clock rules. They lie to associates and customers.
bad,"As a salaried store manager of course you get the short end of the stick most of the time but when you are truly in a binde, you're on your own. Above the store manager, there is no help or support. As a new manager they kind of just throw you to the wolves and its sink or swim. Work-home balance is definitely not there for managers and tbey give you basically nothing for payroll hours so youre stuck."
bad,"In order to ""save money"" you work alone and are told to have a customer you know watch the front of the store if you need to use the restroom. If you are closing the store and you are alone it is expected that your husband/wife will come to the store, sit in the parking lot and watch to make sure you are okay with no compensation for their time and use of their vehicle."
bad,"I felt very taken advantage of by my boss, because if I can do the work and be there then why should she be. Retail, so never a consistent schedule, never can get overtime, and you hustle all day for low pay"
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. They don’t care about their employees. Management does not listen to your suggestions to make worklife easier.  You have no idea how long you will be working each day until the work day is done so can’t plan any doctors appointments or plan on attending your kids school events.  Repetitive use of hands has called permanent damage to my elbows and fingers in less than a year of working at distribution center.
bad,"This company does not care about us as individuals.  The work life balance is horrible due to long working hours.  This job is very hard on my back, hands, wrists and arms."
bad,I use to like my but now management started changing  in problem started so I had to leave. Store manager lying for nothing just problem that I didn't like.
bad,"terrible workplace, poor management, poor communication, no set time to get off, poor work enviroment, not very clean, one shift happy, second shift gets the light load while first does more and receives less praise"
bad,You had a set time to get there everyday but most times we were still working when the next shift came in to work and there was barely enough room for one shift on the line. Its a horrible place to work .
bad,No two days where the same. This kept things interesting and if the assignments had been clear it would have been enjoyable. But the lack of communication between upper management and the store was slim and created many problems for the daily workflow. Turn over is very frequent.
bad,"Dollar General is a great starting job for those who are looking, but I would rather stick to it like that. Management wants too much done with little hours, thus requiring you to pull longer days or doubles to get stuff done. The lack of teamwork is also an issue. With no team, the store is utterly destroyed. A typical day of work usually involves cleaning in the morning and getting the majority of the important stuff done like planograms and seasonal. Once night shift comes, they strictly recover the entire store."
bad,"I work at the Zanesville D.C and I don't recommend this place or any other D.C. they bring in new stuff and expect you to meet a quota  then on top of that they make it mandatory to work on your days off when the volume of product going out is low ."
bad,"I really enjoyed working at Dollar General until they brought in the worse manager I had ever worked under.  She fired everyone and under her management, they had the highest turnover rate they have ever had."
bad,At first this was a great place to work however I had a ongoing stalker and I could not be transferred so I was forced to quit. I made a police report against the company for not providing safety on the premises however they couldn't afford security at the location.
bad,"A typical day starts with coming in and finishing the stuff day shift was too busy to finish. If you're a cashier, you'll run a register. When you're not busy with a customer AT the register, you're expected to stock and recover. Can't have any type of device up front to let you know when a customer is ready so you end up doing a lot of time wasting by having to run back and forth to make sure no one is waiting at the register. Management has unrealistic expectations as to what should be accomplished on a typical shift and doesn't hold all employees to the same expectations."
bad,"I think dollar general was a great place to work providing supervisors never kept anything confidential.  Management never come on the floor to see whats going on. And alot of messy people, and lack of team work. Other than that I loved the hours and the money. But its easy to get fired off of he/she said than production and stealing."
bad,"There is no work/life balance for store managers.  You are expected to work 6 days a week, no exceptions.  Corporate does not care about store level employees even though they wouldn't have an 8-5 M-F if it wasn't for the store employees."
bad,Worked there as an assistant manager and did not have a day off for a long time. Upper management was really horrible. It's a fun job to meet new people but other then that would NOT recommend working here. The pay is not good for the job task on hand.
bad,"If you are not full time they only 4 to 20 hrs a week. It's like being in the military, fighting for there bottom line!!! They don't care about there employees just there bottom line!!! Money is all they care about! Profit, Profit, Profit!!!"
bad,I was there for a year and five months. I was the lead supervisor for a year before I quit. I was not impressed with the management at all. My store manager was talking bad about all the store employees behind everyone's back. She accused me of not doing my job and blamed as much as she could on me or other employees just to try to save hers and the assistant managers jobs. She even threatened my job a few times. The district manager did nothing about anything she was doing. I was stressed about just showing up to work at times because I didn't want to deal with the bs anymore. Eventually I ended up just quitting one day.
bad,I read reviews for the company and they all said bad things about this company. My thought was that the people giving the reviews were just whiners. After three years with Dollar General I was broken down both physically and mentally. The demands that are put on the people that work in the stores are ridiculous. It is nearly impossible to reach the goals that are expected of the store manager. I would not recommend working for this company ever.
bad,DG wants you to work very hard in a stressful environment with no hours allocated to get everything done with minimum wage.  It is a very dangerous job as most times you are in the store by yourself because of the budgeted hours given to the store.  Most customers do nothing but steal because the stores are so understaffed.  Your training is under rated as you are expected to just go to the quiz part just to pass without listening to the videos as they don't have the hours to even cover training! Most all stores are a mess and hard to shop at and you have to wait in long lines at checkout.  They offer no encouragement to keep good employees and don't offer a decent pay to attract any either.
bad,"meeting to see where I would be working at . I can work anywhere in on any given day .  I learned how to load and unload truck ,baller, run a department . . management is poor . long hours . i love my job"
bad,"The company as a whole does not provide the tools necessary to run the stores to the corporate office's expectations.  the training for new managers is horrible, typically you are put into a store and instructed to clean it up.  Then you thrown into a store that has an impacted stockroom and are expected to do magic without any payroll hours to help. Overall, my time with dollar general was definitely a learning experience.  My biggest complaint is that the company as a whole set new managers up to fail."
bad,The leadership culture had poor communications with other employees and did not follow their guidelines that was set forth by the company. The company had a I don't care attitude culture and the past 3 months I have been working for them changed my career goals that was set forth in my first start date.
bad,Need to get it together on ordering.  Poor ordering makes it hard to meet objectives and follow  directives.  Management and employees are in a revolving door.
bad,"Mangers do not talk to each other,customer cussing you out, cashiers do what they want to,very stressful, do not pay employees what they should, but you do the work , no discount for working there,no raise ,or inc. everything I learned by my self or already new, the part i loved was talking to customers and making them smile"
bad,They will find anything and everything wrong with you. They let me go over a jokingly flick as me and my manager on duty did. She called me in over something that was normal for us seeing as we were friends. They did not give me a second chance at all.
bad,"Had Trouble with management always thinking that she could up and leave me at the store by me self after she went on salary and no longer had to clock in and would leave everything up to me paperwork,bankroll,deposits,ect. Started talking to my dist.manager about it because i was training for my own store and she told me to try to hold on but then I decided to move back to Kansas and so that is what i did.Besides all of that I just loved the work and the people had no problems at all with that part of the job."
bad,"My particular Dollar General is not really a good working environment. My store manager and a lead sale that I work with are really nice and good at their job. Our district manager however is not, we lack a lot of resources in my store that causes us not to be able to get our store where it needs to be. Upper management doesn't really listen to its employees. They over work the store managers and most don't last long. I've been at my store a year in December, I've been through countless managers and other sales associates. I'm the only person whose stuck it out and I've never really gotten any appreciation for it."
bad,"In short-There is no sense of satisfaction with this job."
bad,"When I worked at the Dollar general it was terrible and the people didn't care about anything, they would cuss outloud and yell at customers and be just rude to the max"
bad,horrid management. This company lets their managers do and say whatever they want to the employees and customer. Depending on what district manager you end up with this could be the worst job you'll ever have.
bad,Dollar general is not a company that pays well and has no structure the stores are ran poorly and store managers are overworked and underpayed and under appreciated.
bad,"Dollar General honestly only cares about filling their pockets, I was a store manager and they refused to help when i had only myself and another key holder, (Manager), They wanted me to work 6am to 11 pm 7 days a week and did not give me the option of at least letting my key holder get ot it was absolutely ridiculous. The wanted me to do the truck, run register, Do paper work, come to meetings with out giving me hours to staff my store. They do not care about the stress and they do not help at all. I asked for help and never received it. So in conclusion it is a terrible company to work for."
bad,"would not recommend, "
bad,"open the store, Followed a 7day work flow. Everyday there was a certain task that needed to be followed from shipment."
bad,dollar general isnt a place for people. retail is horrible to begin with but dollar general is just really bad. not paid enough for the work they want. they supply the bare minumum and expect greatness
bad,Simply the worst company I've ever worked for.  Claims they will train you but really leave you high and dry and than want to get on your case for not doing tasks that you have no idea how to do.  Management only gets 1.5 days off a week and your lucky if you get that. Upper management doesn't respect your personal time away from work.  This is truly a company that sets people up for failure.
bad,"not consistent on hours, you never know what work is required of unless asked daily. Lack of training on floor or cash register. lack of respect by manager, district manager. no new skills learned unless asked . low wages for job requirements .No organization at all in store"
bad,"Applied here because I was just getting back from college so I was back home visiting for a while. Found out my friend from high school was working here as well. We happened to be discussing pay and he told me that they stated him off at $8.30 meanwhile I'm here making $7.25. So I had a convo with the manger, long story short, basically told me that I shouldn't be discussing pay and it is what it is. Quit that job, next day found something 100x better."
bad,The hours are inconsistent.After the schedule has been posted it is subject to change. The amount of work expected from each employee is unreasonable!
bad,A typical day was working hard with no break and broken bathrooms. I enjoyed most days there but really there are some unprofessional employees. If the manager had an issue with you they would talk to everyone except you.
bad,Dollar General is a revolving door for employees and when they get a  dedicated worker it is not appreciated.  Minimum wage is paid even with an experienced worker.  Raises are only twenty five cents each year for cashiers and key holders.  No matter how much experience you have there are no opportunities to move up.  Managers are not allowed to have enough hours to do all the necessary work that is required.  Managers do not have the capacity to schedule workers more hours to get stores perfect for consumers.  District managers and their superiors make all the decisions for each store without explanations as to why hours are cut.  Managers are criticized constantly and rarely are given compliments for the hard work they do.
bad,"Dollar general is a good place to work, they just don't pay you enough. I was only Part time and I was only getting 4 to five hour shifts 2 to 3 days out of the week."
bad,"I had a manager who worked hard, but the expectations of Dollar General are unreasonable. You are expected to work 40 hours a week, but in reality they wanted you to put out what 3 or 4 people could do to get the job done."
bad,"The only redeeming benefit was our team. Manager, as wonderful as she was/is never received a break or compensation from upper management."
bad,You can make this job work for you or against you. You will have to have thick skin in order to deal with customers and coworkers.  If you don't desire to get into management your pay won't be that great.
bad,"Open or close the store, make the bank run, supervised employees if someone was there working with me. Majority of the time you  was working alone. It was poor management at the time I worked there. The hardest part was working alone and not knowing if you get robbed or not. I actually got robbed at gunpoint and the higher managers didn't act as if they didn't care about my well being. They had cameras in the store that didn't work. I could've lost my life. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with my coworkers."
bad,I was accused of being an accomplice of stealing.  Was told that the cameras are for employees and not customers.  Pay us little for as much as you deal with public!  This is a million dollar company making money off its employees!  There is a lot of waste.  Manger and assistant manager never wanted to work!
bad,"Barely any hours, pay wasn'y barely enough to live off of. Everything in the store was old and broken , nothing was ever fixed, always running out of bags , nothing was every easy on us as cashiers and there was minimal help ."
bad,"Their company is just nt a good one. they have poor management skills. also, they treat their employees very poor. no holidays off except Christmas day"
bad,"Dollar general is a corporate menace that keeps a choke hold on its employees at all levels. They don't seem to understand that the phrase ""you get what you pay for"" works both ways, and when you don't invest in your employees or their future, they're going to pack up and run the first chance they get."
bad,company would tell you that you would have a set amount for truck loads and when you would be time to leave they come up with more trucks to do and make you stay later then expected. they do not communicate with you or your peers and in a work place that is very crucial.
bad,"Manager's and Supervisors both Suck. They have expectations that I know they can't even meet themselves. If you have an emergency and need to leave you get written up, pretty much you get written up for everything and they always threaten you with your job."
bad,Stores are usually filthy and cluttered. Turnover rate is excessively high and stores are usually understaffed. Poor management. An overall bad experience working here. Do not recommend.
bad,Horrible pay location was awful due to types of customers who came to shop there no hours  customers were very rude I got threatened every day and manamgemt did nothing they don't support there employees
bad,The over all experience of working at dollar general wasn't for me. The heavy lifting and putting up crates was the worse part. I had to stay late most of the time to finish cleaning and the mangers were rude.
bad,"Its all about the company, you will have no life.! Not sure what else they want me to say..  Managers make decent pay, but in turn you must give your soul to dollar general."
bad,"You know what time you go in but you never know what time you are going o leave the work load is to streesful, dont appericate what you give them in work performance."
bad,"As a manager, I worked 15 hour days, at least 6 days a week. During a 2 month period, I had 2 days off. If you have a family or a personal life, you can kiss them goodbye. DM's and above don't care about you personally and do the minimum amount for the individual store. DG allots a minimum number of payroll hours, but expects more than humanly possible with training, stocking and keeping the store ready to shop. Theft was sky high as well."
bad,This place does not care about employees. Take advantage of the people. Will worke you to death and not help at all.  Product is expired and no one will pull it from shelf
bad,"Do not work there unless you have to. The first summer, the air conditioning broke in August and it took three days for a repairman to get there. My first manager was okay, but the five after him were not. There is too much for me to get into without this turning into a gigantic rant. I can not come up with anything positive to say about it."
bad,Work is physically draining with minimal compensation. No overtime permitted.  Payroll budgets are laughable. Expectations are extreme yet staffing is scarce. This company operates as if it was a loan shark!
bad,Overall management sucks. They talk and treat you any kind of way. The only thing good about this company is the pay and benefits you receive after 90 days
bad,Dollar general is a great company to work for if you're still in high school and  just looking for an in-between job. I would definitely recommend it for a first time job.
bad,"I would start the day by opening the store by myself. Wouldn't have an available cashier for the first 3 hours of business. Meanwhile checking in vendors and cashing out customers at the same time. I think it wasn't managements fault, because we only had a certain budget to work with on scheduling employees, it was more of a corporate thing. So that made that job hard at times. The enjoyable part were the customers and the employees I worked with."
bad,"Dollar General is a fast pace, repetitive job.  Customer service is a critical part of this job, there are issues on a daily basis that require the Store Manager to step in.  The DMs put a lot of pressure on you to make sure that all the setups are completed on a timely basis and if it is not completed then the store will become behind in all other aspects of the running of the store.    A typical day starts between 6:30am and 7am and does not end until 4:30pm unless staff calls in and you have to cover their shift.  Being a SM does not allow a great home life balance so I would not recommend this to a person who has small children due to it is required to work 5 1/2 days and close 2 nights a week.  There are times that the SM works 60+ hours and if staff quit and you don't have enough staff then you are stuck working.  Truck days begin at 6am no exceptions and it is very physical, a store usually gets 2000 cartons and it takes 3 days to put up and you have to motivate the staff to work the products out."
bad,The culture here is displeasing and not at all what I thought it would be. They make it known that they dont trust anyone and that everyone is replaceable. The quality of life to work ratio is unrealistic and the benefits are terrible.
bad,Company requires you to work freight on register in a timely fashion. Customers are just so rude customer satisfaction is my top priority and the Customers are no help once I helped a woman out with a price check and she called corporate and said I was laughing at her and took the product for myself like what?? Not even that if you're right about coupon fraud and the customer calls corporate they will tell you it's poor customer service and will tell you to take care of the customer and you still get in trouble for accepting counterfeit coupons
bad,Hours and salary are very low. Very demanding work flow and don't give enough hrs on payroll. My commute to work was 30 miles one way. I was only getting 15-20 hrs a week. It wasn't enough to pay bills and keep making the drive.
bad,"Working for dollar general is horrible because of the way the upper management runs their business, and it all falls on the front line of us at the store."
bad,"Wages are the lowest in the country. Even if you get promoted to keyholder or asst manager, the pay is still awful. I made more money washing dishes at Dennys than i did as a keyholder at DG. There are NO benefits, no time and a half. The place is a revolvong door for employees. This makes it impossible to have a smooth running ship when your longest tenured employee has only been there a few months. And it greatly increases your work load because your always short handed 1 or 2 people. My store manager was fired for a number of bad things. And the new manager seemed out of place and even lazy at times. Overall it was my worst job experiance of my 12 years in the work force. Avoid at all costs unless you are really desperate. Even then, make it a temporary pit stop. Its not a long term job and there is no advancment. Corporate is very stingy also."
bad,The only reason job security and advancement got five Stars is because everyone is always quiting so they are always under staffed even within management so they can't fire you and more then likely if you've been around long enough you'll get offered a management position
bad,"I enjoyed working for the company, but the pay and constant schedule changes made it impossible to depend on the job to take care of my family. I do not recommend the Mableton/Austell location for anyone with real life responsibilities."
bad,A typical day would be coming to work with shelves empty and a  stock room so full you can barely walk in it. Carts are jammed in the aisles and boxes are all over the floor.
bad,"Terrible work environment"
bad,A typical day at work is attending to customers and stocking shelf's. Cleaning up the bathrooms and mop the floor. Help out costumers if needed. I don't get a lunch break do to me working only part time between the hours from 5pm to 9:30pm. Sometimes I work mornings.
bad,"I was hired as a replacement for a girl who was going to college, my first couple days I started to realize that the store I was hired at was going down hill. The store manager told me she didn't know how I was supposed to clock in, she also informed me that she didn't know how to count change back to a customer. Everyday I would come in on my days just to help unload palettes because she didn't do any of them like she was supposed. I would be called on everyday off to come help. I ended up having to choose work or school, so I decided to go to school. Later finding out 2 other employees left with me."
bad,"The company itself is horrible to work for. They refuse overtime and cut your hours if over. You don't get any recognition for hard work and perseverance. They base your work off customers so most of the time if you can't do something because of company policy and the customer gets mad, they'll give a bad review or call corporate and blame you."
bad,"Dollar Genera keeps its extremely low prices by paying their salaried manager a decent amount, but after the amount of hours worked, it is ever worth it.  All the managers in my district worked 60-70 hours a week, just to keep the store afloat since they were all salaried.  All other employees got no more than 24 hours and the assistants only 30."
bad,The management often screws up and blames it on  the staff. Make sure you have your own checklist because they will blame everything on the cashiers and/or keyholders. This happened at multiple stores ... so i think it's a problem with management and procedures.
bad,the job is not hard at all there is mostly stocking products taking care of your customers and I showed up for work before my boss. But how I came to the conclusion she is racist there is only 2 white women who work there myself and another female and she will schedule white workers 12 hours a week while scheduling african american and hispanic  workers aare scheduled 20 hours and over a week. This has happened for the past month so I am giving my 2 week notice today and I have another job.
bad,Originally your told that you would work 40 hours a week but once you are on site your then informed that your wages/hours is based on the amount of productivity that is received each evening.  Then there were times you would arrive to work at 6pm and be sent home by midnight.  Your check totally less than $200 per week.
bad,"I worked at dollar general for almost three years. In those three years i called off twice. In the last few months of my employment there, i was undergoing extreme harassment from the store manager, a fellow co worker.  Our District manger did nothing to fix the situation.  after i came to him many times for help. The job itself was not a bad job, was easy."
bad,"I'm in college right now, so I'm working at Dollar General to keep money in my pocket and to pay my bills. Just like any a lot of companies, you're not going to move up in position or money if you don't have a great relationship with someone in a higher up position than you are."
bad,The only thing i would do is shop here. Working here i was treated harsh. When you are new the older workers treat you as if you are a child. Mainly acting like you are supposed to know how to work those 1900 b.c. IBM registers. Also the key holders think they are store mangers (i.e.) Hiding out off camera in a break room while there are rush hours (12pm and 7pm). Houma Louisiana location
bad,"Took me only 2 days to realize this place sucked. Management was all over and the poor cashier was forced to stock shelves, straighten, and run the register. Oh and did I mention while training me? Management only came to help when called or felt they should. I wouldn't recommend this job to any one. Thank God I work elsewhere to. Waste of time!"
bad,"Pay is great however if you have a family kiss them goodbye because you will work 14 to 16 hours a day by yourself no hours to work people.....I had 3 days off in a 2 1/2 months.....phones in store didn't work, had to use personal cell phone for store with no phone allowance.....65 to 80 hours a week..do not work for this company, expected to throw freight, run the register, check in vendors and do your management duties all by yourself......HR told me that Dollar General is not going to change....so I did....I changed careers"
bad,"Easy to advance here. Why? The turnover rate is about 99%, even for management. "
bad,"Pros"
bad,"A typical day at work includes me running a register, maintaining clean well stocked shelves, and at the end of the night cleaning the store. I learned how to use a register and what is expected of me in a work place. My coworkers are great people. We all formed a close bond. The hardest part of the job is the boredom. The most enjoyable part is the bond I form with customers."
bad,"While I was training at another store, I had a great manager. When they opend the store that I was hired for the manager was not doing her job. the clerks were doing all her managment jobs. Also on day when I opened the other associate did not show up so I called my manager she said that I was to run the store by myself. I had to work 9 hours till the other shift showed up. I had no break at all.  I understand not all managers are this way but This company has a hard time keeping people and now I know why."
bad,"The culture needs to be change. High turnover, very demanding schedule. You can close one night just to open the next day. This is hard working, you have to know how to multitask, be physically fit for this job.be on your feet for however long your shift is with exceptions in breaks and lunch of course. the pay is not worth what they expect from the employee."
bad,"This company has no regard for their employee's safety or health. Company does not give store enough budgeted hours to get the job done.  Company does not follow their own guidelines for problem solving.  I left with them owning me part of my paycheck.  Dealing with customers was very enjoyable, you meet new people and have your regular customers as well."
bad,Your co-workers do very little to help or do their job at all. When the general Manager comes in everyone puts everyone down to make themselves look good even though they can be the laziest ones at work.
bad,Love working here despite they closed down there business and moved far away without warning leaving me to stress over finding an new job
bad,"hated it. Glad I'm not there any more ,thay don't care about any one thay have working for them.Bad company to work for.would never never go back to work for them."
bad,"I liked working with customers , keeps the day going fast. Customers are very nice I like to help them find things they need, when there in a hurry. Have to do recovery which is also something I like doing, also keeping the store clean. Co-workers are great to work with had not have any problems. The store is easy to run, and manage."
bad,This company promised the world but was not supportive. The expectations for the employees were ridiculous for the pay offered them. District Manager's had 19 stores and could not really help. There was no bench to pull from if you found yourself without a member of management. The store I was at grossed over 2 million dollars a year but received minimal payroll.
bad,"When I worked there we were robbed twice. Was in a low income area , I quite because my safety is more important than the $8 a hr I was making to work there."
bad,"I am a current store manager. Your starting pay will be salaried between $34-35,000 a year. So you will be making less than an assistant at Wal-Mart, a Zms at Wal-Mart, and some department managers. You have no life in between you are suppose to work 5 1/2 days a week which turns into 7. You work massive hours. 70+ is nothing in a week. You work as much as an offshore employees for half their salary. Your cashiers may only work 2-3 days a week. Average store budgeted hours for a $2 million dollar store is 160 hours to spread amongst employees. Only fulltime is assistant and one lsa(key holder).Average pay for a key holder is $9, assistant is $10 cashiers is minimum wage $7.25. Massive turnover, had 3 district managers in my 7 months with Dg. You make just enough to starve and keep the lights on to see self do it. It's a single persons job. I have lost 2 gf in the time been here due to never being home. You can say got to balance it better but you can't. Get there at 6am and leave when it closes 10pm cause a cashiers not coming in for a 3 hour shift. Costs more to get there than they will make. Your salaried so you belong to them. From what I learned so far that having been a store manager for Dg isn't that impressive it's about like saying you were the ""best cheerleader at homeschool"". That is an exact quote from a hr manager in which a company I applied for here recently.  It's not a job for everyone, so be wary but it could be your next career so either way good luck with your search"
bad,"My typical Day Is very busy , There is only two employees in the store so you have to be very good at multitasking."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Long tiring hours. I am no stranger to hard work. I actually prefer it because it makes the days go by faster but these guys dump a mountain of work on you with very little staff to execute. It is stressful to say the least. And when I say no staff I mean I would literally be by myself for long hours at a time in my store. I have never worked for a grocery/convenience store (especially one that was so big) that thought it acceptable to allow employees to be alone on a shift. It is irresponsible, dangerous, and just plain cheap! I think it may even be illegal!"
bad,"Very stressful was a typical day at work. If you think your coworkers are your friends, you are wrong, only a few will stand beside you. Management in the last 4 months shows no respect for their employees, I was one of them. Hardest part was expecting tasks completed with no resources in  which to complete them. Most enjoyable was meeting new people every day."
bad,"Typically I was a cashier most of the time, put up merchandise to sell, cleaned store, helped customers with any questions or complaints."
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for several months and did not like it what so ever. When the manager needed someone to go in I would gladly go in. I cleaned doors, sweep concrete, clean counters, take out trash, stalk cokes for the morning shift, stalk shelves, organize merchandise, greet customers, check out customers, move and also organize merchandise when moved. My co-workers were great motivated, fast- paced, friendly. The hardest part of my day would be having to have such a negative manager. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting new people everyday."
bad,"Too many grey areas in the SOP, not enough clarification from corporate on these and when there was it was always clouded. The management at store level is expected to basically do everything needed to keep the store running as efficiently as possible even with a cut in weekly store operational hours. There is, at times, little support from the district manager level due to many tasks/duties assigned from the upper levels of management. The company has seemed to care more about its profits than it does its own employees, especially at the store level which is where the company survives. If it were not for the store employees, the company would be in even more trouble than it is now.  Granted, there were good times there but they seemed to be few and far in between. The co-workers were very good to work with and were always willing to do what was asked of them."
bad,"I started working full time at dollar general store while in high school, enjoyed the work, but the manager only hired her church friends and hired me only to unload the trucks since it was all women that worked there, refused to give me weekends off, and promoted me for that reason so I could make bank deposits and count down the registers so she could go to her church functions."
bad,The co-workers where good but the district manager had real bad communication and people skills 
bad,.Great customers. Great Employees. Terrible company to work for.
bad,"For a short period I was a store manager at Dollar General and for the money working 6 days a week was truly not rewarding. No payroll flexibility, not enough people, and very little guidance."
bad,"Dollar General has got to be the worse company to be employed by! They do NOT offer senior citizen discounts, discounts to our military, nor to their employees and its not how well you do your job or how well you build a rapport with your customers, its all about politics within the store and who you know. To the corporate office you are just another number."
bad,The workers there are hard working and delicated. The days are long and difficult to navigate. The most enjoyable part of the job are people the you work with.
bad,The worse place i have ever worked!!! you are expected to do the work of 3 people akk within a 7 hour shift...management was awesome. The company wants perfection but are not willing to pay the man hours that it takes to get the place in order. employees don't last and its hard to form any real structure when you have to train people every three weeks.
bad,Dollar General Store only satisfies themselves. The managers are overworked with very minimal employee help to complete daily tasks. Their only benefit is getting paid weekly. I would not recommend this company to nobody. They don't care about their employees one bit!!!
bad,Poorly managed location was not set up for success. poorly managed. Did not enjoy employment there.
bad,"My immediate manager was great but above her it went downhill. You are required to work in a ver unorganized manner, with a staff that was to small, and not allowed enough hours for the amount of work required. Also the computer/ cash register system was very poor."
bad,"It's a good stepping stone job, would say it's okay for a short period, lots of work and multitasking, you learn alot. Can be room for advancement if you can stand to stay with the company"
bad,"Little pay for a whole lot of work. You can truly work 40+ hours one week and then only work 5 the next. While their doctrine says family oriented its far from it. Personal reasons for saying this. While it's a lot of work, if you get the right store it can be very rewarding."
bad,"This company has no work life balance. They expect managers to work in stores alone in dangerous areas. The pay would be ok, provided you could work just your hours and not those of an entire store."
bad,I feel that my time at dollar general was not great at all! The manager constantly harassed me and was very disrespectful. She played favorites and if you weren't one of hers she would talk about you behind your back and call you stupid. When our district manager came in he would not help us at all. Many of my co-workers at the time no longer work there because of the situation.
bad,"Depending on what district you are in, as a store manager do not expect to much help from your DM. DM does not care what happens, it’s your store, you handle it."
bad,It was a good opportunity for me to gain management experience. I also learned what it takes to be a leader and run an establishment to the public. Thumbs up.
bad,"Don’t work for Telephone location if she’s having a bad day she will make u have a bad day.It doesn’t matter how good u are, they will not respect you."
bad,I don't know if it's the company or the store i worked at but management was horrible.  Never worried about me or any other employees had on the job affair to the point the girl quit to help him keep his job.  Go to upper management and they laugh and tell the manager that you called them.
bad,They paid 7.25 and you cannot work over 20 hours a week and they cut hours and days you work and management was poor and about the product than employees safety issues
bad,Treated horribly to the point where I ended up leaving. The coworkers were extremely rude and the manager was a mess. The office was a complete mess there was mold in the store.
bad,"Meeker DG is not a great place to work,managment changes, not fair hours and so much stress and competition I only liked working there in the beginning because it was close to home."
bad,"Before I worked here I thought highly of this company,  but now it's a joke, don't work here they barely pay you enough to make ends meet.  If  I knew what I now know, I would have never applied  here."
bad,"Company is opening stores at break neck speed, putting those that need more grooming into positions without the proper people skills. Total disregard for home work balance"
bad,The employees there are rude and disrespectful to everyone. The employees that do their jobs are always the ones being put down and the ones that do drugs while on clock or say and do inappropriate things are the ones rewarded.
bad,Terrible place to work  the workload is hectic and the pay is stagnant. Management wants you to give your life but give nothing in return expect for a 20% discount on dg private label items
bad,If the district manager team would of worked together as a team alot of the stores would look better and the customers would be happier. And the csr need better training and also watch the employees better so they do their job better and make sure the mgt actually show up to work because they get paid salary.
bad,Customers will call and complain about the employee no matter if your nice or not. The other employees are nothing but drama back stabbers that will stand there and watch you bleed with the knife still in your back. The district manager is always changing. The rules are always changing for certain employees. So if your not a suck up you get treated like dirt. If that sounds like fun then this is the job for you.
bad,"I enjoyed my job and the people who worked there except the schedule was not enough The pay was okay I loved the customers . "
bad,Nice employees to work with. Poor managament. No incentive to rise up in the company. Love what I did just not happy how you are treated. Not a company I would recommend for a career.
bad,"Required 6 day work week as store manager. Not enough hours allocated to schedule for the amount of work required.   Not a good place to work. You'll need to put in about 80 hours a week just to have the store stay on track, only get paid for 45....."
bad,Dollar General did not have enough payroll to cover the breaks and meals. Low payroll. Lines at the registers. The store I worked in was very busy. Very hard to have good service and keep a clean store
bad,He put more more on your plate each month every year. The pay is horrible based on the market and that’s from store managers to floor associates. The hiring pool is terrible based on your pay rate. They never give me enough hours to complete the task in the demand that they want and they actually somehow another go in and take hours away for me during the busiest times of the year
bad,"It was my first job after graduating high school and thought it would be an easy slow job but oh man it wasn’t, it was I my you and a manger, so you had to do everything in a time limit which made it stressful"
bad,Always short staffed and no one wants to work. Been times I was the only one in store so freight barely could get done. The main thing is too many robberies not a safe place to work because they don’t have security throughout day and night. Unfit working conditions.
bad,"Extreme amounts of hours as a store manager. Low pay for employees make it impossible to keep a store staffed, the hard work and overly extreme expectations run the underpaid off quickly. High turn over rate in all positions. Management is impossible to communicate with, and they contradict themselves at turn. If you are a store manager looking for any type of developemwnt to advance to multi unit then dollar General is not for you. You will"
bad,I worked there when I was in school but when I graduated I left bc I could not make enough to live I was always living pay check to paycheck barely the manager was good but that’s about it.
bad,"Not only are employees underpaid, but the concrete floor hurts your entire legs even in orthopedic shoes after standing on it day in and day out. Customers will often treat staff as sub human and chew them out over a 25 cent coupon they found in the trash somewhere. (This is only slightly an exaggeration.) Keyholders are expected to have constant availability and have their life revolve around only dollar general and nothing else. Dont work here."
bad,My poor boss at DG was great but suffered due to a constant rotation of District Managers. Each one seemed to know less than the last one about procedure and guidelines. The upper management also cared little to none for average employees. If you weren't the GM or Assistant they assumed you were a pass through. This was actually said to me while I was an Assistant Manager and again when I was interim GM of this same store. The other employees and GM were great but upper management lacked training and tack
bad,"DM's don't care about their mgrs, they allow bullies & disrespect from other mgrs towards other employees/mgrs so they don't hve to hire & train again. they manipulate and threaten their employees to stay on promising they will do something about it and do nothing. i was a mgr for 3 yrs and stepped back down to asst. because of the disrespect people have towards mgrs. I've worked for DG for 16 yrs, and the company  (regional mgr i mwill say) dropped my hrs down from 40 to 32 because that is all asst mgrs get. BULL!!! when i was an asst. i alway got 40 hrs and i was an asst. for 12 yrs before becoming a mgr. they dropped me down because i make way ovr what an asst. makes because ive been with them so long. worst place to work"
bad,"I was never fast enough for my managers. "
bad,"Loved the location and the corporation which made being fired even worst. "
bad,"They pay is low! Definitely not paid according to experience.  Pay raises and evaluations are non existent! Workload is way too much for the staff or time allotted.  Management doesn't respect availability and will try to bully you into working outside of yours! This is a job not a career. If your trying to support your family on one income, this isn't a place for you!"
bad,They treat the employees horrible.  still thinking about filing harassment suit ..they work you like a dog when they need you but when they dont...the company doesn't care if you starve..
bad,"Dollar General expects managers to constantly do more with less. Never enough payroll to complete the work load, but they expect it to be completed anyway. As a manager, on salary, you are expected to always be on call for questions from employees."
bad,"The time I spent working for Dollar General, while relatively brief, was educational about the process of working for a franchise in the retail industry. The sales associate positions are not for everyone; moving freight out onto the sales floor requires a healthy body and the cashier duties can be frustrating if you're not good with keeping your calm in stressful situations. The culture of Dollar General can be a little stifling to deal with, as well; regulations are expected to be followed to the letter, not the spirit, of the regulation. The benefits for part-time employees are disappointing, as they do not offer a wide enough compliment of resources compared to full-time and salaried corporate positions; expect to go without full insurance, and settle for only the basic of dental and vision plans, as well as an underutilized and underperforming teledoc service."
bad,The job is really stressful. I would not recommend this job to anyone. A single would be suited for this job. Someone who doesn't have responsibilities.
bad,"As a dollar general employee, I can say one thing if it wasn't for my great boss I wouldnt be here. We are over worked and under paid, the payroll only offer so many hours and we aren't able to get anymore then 30 hours it seems and its always a battle to keep up with truck and overstock. This company doesn't think about there employees they only care about the money."
bad,I was constantly working overtime. A lot of workers would walk out mid shift. Scheduling was not organized. Paper bags were a big inconvenience for the customer buying  large and heavy products. The closing system in the Framingham ma location should be fixed.
bad,"In all honesty, they stuck me in this worst store in town. The managers Assistant Manager was her live in boyfriend. The store was constantly a mess and getting fined by the fire dept. She always made sure her boyfriend had the best hours and easiest jobs. Her ability to delegate, motivate and lead was non existent. I took the job in order to advance, which on paper I did (I passed my Assistant tests). But was never taught a thing by the Manager or allowed to work a morning shift, in order to learn and progress. Everything I learned was by trial and error and on my own. It's also the store with the highest theft and the cops were called weekly."
bad,"the company demanded more and more from its managers without any care for their home life."
bad,"This job will consume your life and make you old before your time. Upper Mgmt is a joke, payroll budget too small for amount of work expected. Managers required to work 6 days a week, pay rate for hourly employees prevents hiring decent people(minimum wage in most locations). Corporate motto is 'Serving Others"", but company culture is GREED."
bad,It gave me customer service skills. The Dollar General I worked at was a fast pace store very busy. The customers were nice if you showed them good service.
bad,"The expectations that are given by Dollar General are impossible with the labor they give the stores unless the Store Manager works 65+ 6-7 day work weeks (And with out the perfect crew still not very possible). Pay is ok, however not sufficient enough to keep a good experienced crew for long. Proper training is practically impossible with the workload."
bad,"I liked working at the Dollar General, I got to meet new people and seen people I knew form other jobs. I like working with money and counting, so I really liked that part of the job. The co-workers were all nice and helpful too."
bad,"If you become a manager remember: 1. No days off 2. Anything your staff cannot get done is on you 100% along with anything they mess up that you have to fix 3. Do not expect hours for your employees or to be able to give them the money they deserve for the job and don't expect the good ones to stay because of that 4. If you do find good ones, do what you can to keep them 5. If you enjoy working from 6am-6pm most nights and 6am-11pm at least once a week (pretty much live at the store and have no home life other than shower and sleep) then DG is perfect for you!"
bad,Very clicky and they wouldn’t count your drawer at end of shift stating they didn’t have too and would let you know the next day . Wow ... seriously that’s a big security breach and keeps people at bay as to whether they were over or short. Remember it’s your drawer and you should know that day at end of shift not later in the day or next day...no wonder they have a revolving door for help .... with that I quit right on the spot .... never again !
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend seeking long term employment with this company. You will have all responsibilities of the store with the exception of dropping money off at the bank and counting money/closing the store. You will be paid very poorly, and have a lot expected of you for a terrible pay rate. I would only consider this job if you need something very short term."
bad,"dollar general stinks, corporate only cares about keeping stores open, they don't care about employees, only store managers. store managers get away with about anything but theft, this includes leaving whenever they want, coming in whenever they want, with my store manager she wouldn't even come in some days! at one point another co-worker and myself added up all of our store manager's vacation days, it totaled over 3 weeks, when she was supposed to get only one, when we brought this up to corporate and mentioned we get treated like scum when we have to call out sick we were told it would be looked into, nothing happened and she took another week off! i mean this place is great if you can stand to work long enough to get to store manager and you want to poo on everyone else that works in your store!"
bad,"Dollar General seems to hire anybody who needs a job. For the work you do and the pay you receive, most people do not stay. It is a small store that has good prices for some brand name items! They just expect you to do too much for the pay you receive."
bad,As a very hard working employee I always came to work on time and did was I was asked. Management did not care about their employees and there fore morale was very low.
bad,"Dollar general is not a good place to work at because of the hours they give you, they pay is horrible especially having to stock the shelves and run they register is the line gets back up."
bad,"too much work without realistic understanding of each stores unique challenges. one size doesn't fit all. i know how to mange people and products, just let me do it."
bad,"People were promoted on how much they smiled and based on a one time store visit. When I worked at the store,I kept the aisles open for customers an had a major role in keeping the shelves organized and up to date."
bad,Would not recommended this company. Pay is minimal and expeded to work maximum hours in a SM position. They have zero reguard to work/home life fairness to managers. Poor staffing structure and training matrix.
bad,"Management Was Terrible, They Didn’t Help The Cashiers When They Had A Line All The Way To The Back Of The Store Due To It Being Last Minute Holiday Shopping, Sat Outside And Smoke Cigarettes For Almost an Hour, Always On The Phone Or Sitting In The Office Reading A Book"
bad,In my opinion Dollar General works their employees way to hard for little pay. No matter how hard you work its never enough and the store never gets has enough hours to do all the task they ask to be done. My experience at DG was awful with a manager that put more stress on me then i could handle. Most of the time not getting a break my whole shift. They did get a new manager but only after almost a year working under this poor management.
bad,a typical day at work was slow. i didn't learn anything.management was alright.it was a pretty alright work culture. the hardest part about the job was stocking and ringing people out at the same time.the job wasn't really that enjoyable
bad,Good job if you have no family and don't mind working salary and working 70 hours a week and getting paid for 48 of them on call 24 7 and having no dm to reach out to that does work in a timely order. Been with company for 8 year and I am very frustrated with higher up when you reach out for your help and it's not responded to
bad,"Let me preface this by saying that the management team I worked with was amazing. However, Human Resources does not care about it's customers or employees and does not adhere to their own policies. They placated a former employee who had obviously lashed out in retaliation from being fired for money problems (which is always a big deal for DG). As a result, I lost my job due to hearsay and no physical evidence of the claim. When I tried to dispute it, they said no without taking the time to look through the file or ask questions. They are greedy with store hours and pay. Employees get shafted on hours and pay because managers are not given enough hours for accurate store volume. I was not given a raise for my promotion because the manager did not have enough in her budget to give me a raise even though it's required. The company only cares to tell you about hidden rules and policies after you have broken them. Bottom line, if you work here, don't make anyone mad because Dollar General will find something to fire you for."
bad,"It was always under staffed so no matter how hard you worked, the work was never done, and the managers were not helpful.  A lot was expected of single employees, even brand new employees. Hardly a training period."
bad,"Extremely poor management , complains about employees to other employees and customers. Nothing is taken serious here until the store manager finally a ”dust bunny” in a corner. You will receive no appreciation and everything you do is wrong from greeting customers to cleaning toilets. Want to work at dollar General? I suggest a different location, maybe one where more that two people are kind to customers."
bad,"Dollar Store doesn't pay their workers very much at all and also they give zero benefits, because they don't necessarily care about their employees since there is such a high turn over rate.  But all in all it was okay."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the work done and getting the hours I wanted. I enjoyed the people and environment and learned something new every day.
bad,The Cherokee KS dollar general is super stressful with the majority of the employees acting as if they are still in junior high and it is filled with double standards and unfairness
bad,"Was hired in as asst. mgr.  Spent 95% of the time as a cashier. I wanted desperately to help improve store conditions, but couldn’t because I was chained to the register. Store had a stockroom completely full of freight to be stocked, but there was never anyone there to do it. Co-workers more likely to BS with the customers, or sit in the office on their phones. Most counter-productive environment I’ve ever been a part of."
bad,"Hello! Do you like being worked half to death for minimum wage? Are tired feeling secure and not having to worry about being fired? Well, have we got job for you!"
bad,The higher management was extremely poor. Not friendly people at all. To much play time and not enough taking work serious. Was run more like a daycare than i actual business.
bad,Very stressful bust my butt her never got told good job and the district manager only care about meeting her goals pay is not that great for sales associate so they leave and they have a high turn over rate
bad,"It was fun. Until coworkers and managers changed. Messy. Then clean. Totes after totes. Lovely customers. Higher lever managers and bosses, weren’t always nice.. acted like they were better."
bad,"I learned that if you wasn't buddies with the manager then you got terrible hours and even treated like dirt. The store will never look decent. They send too much freight and expect two people to put it all up. Shelves are always empty, because there is no time to stock. I got awesome hours, and paid pretty decent, but it is not worth being treated so poorly."
bad,the expectations for work verses pay is ridiculous management is not trained at all pay is terrible full time is less than 40 hours a week no way anyone could pay their bills on what they get paid there
bad,Just overwhelming work they come in and help once then just let you go .. When you have two weeks worth of trucks and not enough payroll to help put it away it's not a good thing
bad,The Pay is okay but not for all you do you could be over your department but then be ask to work on some one else department and then get fussed at because your department is not finish. Then if you are the cashier for the day you have no help no back up the manager scheduling is poor. never schedule enough people for expect for you to work a miracle.
bad,"Expectations are ridiculous with this company! Greet every customer, but scheduled by yourself to also run freight, clean, etc. No time for breaks as required by law. Promises made but never follow through. Unable to get things fixed in stores in any sort of time frame, upper management is a joke! "
bad,cleaning and organizing the store.unload truck and stock items. helping customers in a timely manner. have great customer service.make bank deposits nightly.
bad,There is not a typical day when dealing with the public anything can happen. I had a great manager but when dealing with HR if needed it takes a long time to speak with the right person. The hardest part of job is not being able to satisfy a customer.  When you do help a customer resolve a issue it is the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"The work load is easy everyday, but can be very stressful because the managers expect you to cash everyone out on your own. Even if the line is wrapped around the store the general manager won't help you. She's very rude. Also there's never more than one cashier working at a time so you run back and forth from stocking shelves and cashing out customers. It's hard to keep an eye on the register when you're aisles away from it. Overall the work they except you to do on your own is worth more than $8.15:hr. In my opinion we do more than the managers because all they do is stock the shelves and set end caps."
bad,under staffed for all the jobs expected in a typical day. Super strict on the hours that are allowed to work. schedule created by computer at corporate rather than by store manager
bad,First task is opening the store. any manager would get there 30 minutes before opening in order to setup registers and get the daily reports. there would be vendors waiting to bring in their items for the store. once you verify the cashier cash you put that cash drawer in the assigned register. then you open the store.
bad,"worked 80 plus hours a week. no family time, you are just a number, not real friendly. the company is cut throat. will not spend money for preventive maintenance or repairs."
bad,This is the only job where I saw that the me n my store manager did all the work there and the employees would not do nothing. I would continuously bring it to the attention of my store manager and nothing would be done. I had no back up to make the store job less stressful for management.
bad,Management was not that bad however expected a lot of out the employees when we was very busy and only one register working and two people on staff. Then treated others with disrespect just because of someone being pregnant .
bad,"As a manager there, you will have absolutely no support from corporate and the ONLY thing that matters is making money without spending any to upkeep their stores or give you enough schedule hours to complete tasks without working off the clock. It is stressful and you really do not matter to the company at all."
bad,Always have to clean up work area before beginning the day.  Too little pay for the job requirements.  Favoritism is played.  Never know from week to week how many hours you'll work.
bad,"Manager would give me a hard time would""t let me advance in my training process. She either would give you hours only when her favorite employees wanted days  off."
bad,I moved up fast in the company. I had my own store in just a few months. At first they make it so you feel like you're doing a good job and after a while they show their true colors. Customer service is not really important to them at all. It's all about getting the freight out and a junky store. They talk about customer service but the lines are long and no one cares.
bad,"They work you to death and don't care about you!  If they had set"
bad,"Too long of a day too much standing, employees not coming into work, lack of management, not enough hourly pay scheduling, advancement, extended holiday hours"
bad,I worked my way up to associate to salaries store manger. What a waste of time. They don't take the proper time to train people just throw them to the wolves. I would never work here again. It's not worth the stress they put on the store managers
bad,No respect for employees will toss who ever doesnt wotk how they want PER STORE out on their rear ends. Was there 2 years. Young management with little respect for anyone working there.
bad,"I really dont think they treat everybody the same"
bad,i didnt like the management at dollar general but other than that i like my job. i learn how to deal with people atitudes there. i know how to talk to people alot better
bad,"I don't want to take the time to review because there isn't much to say - the bottom line is sales and shrink and while the mission statement is ""Serving Others"" many times the sales and shrink numbers come first."
bad,"High turn rate from corporate to management. High safety risk districts. Revenue more important than quality employees. Poor management preparations for new store managers. Employed six months, went through 3 district managers before leaving."
bad,I liked this job. but the customers will get mad at you for something that you are not in charge of like price change and etc... you wont get a lot of hours that's why most workers branched off to find another job. you will get very aggravated and want to say some mean things but you have to be polite smile and keep working.
bad,They didn't treat there employees with respect i would always here management yelling at some one and some of them were friends of mine that work hard it was disrespectful
bad,On any given day at work you are assigned or expected to complete at least 15 or 20 different tasks before going home. My biggest issue with this job was that I couldn't work full time on a salary based income there and still raise my 1 year older daughter. The District Manager was not helpful towards me and was not supportive by any means.
bad,i would ride on my rc pallet jack and pick orders depending which department. The hardest part was it was very physical and long hours almost everyday. My day went super fast from the moving around constantly
bad,"What I learned here is no matter what the employee working around me is doing, to never give in. Always have a positive mind and be the bigger person at work. Customers will applaud you for the work that is done professional."
bad,Not a good place to manage as there is no support from the district manager and it is a shame to work so hard and not have the resources for help when you are in need of it.
bad,A typical night that they had me on was stressful I am 49 will be 50at the end of this year. I need a  not so stressed enviroment. I did learn alot about  working in a store as retail is . co workers were young and texting all and i mean all the time. They would not releave me on a 4 hour shift for restroom/ or  break. So no I will not recommend them as a employer/ but do continue to shop there.
bad,hated the store not the workers had to work with no air condition half the summer was told if i didnt work i was going to be terminated also i got dehydrated and went to the emergency room
bad,Good for a part time job for college or high school students. Not a job to survive off of. Unrealistic expectations of managers.
bad,"My day at work was filled with adventure, i always learned something new every day. I had fun working with customers. I learned how to deal with confrontation in different ways."
bad,"MY typical day was very nice when everyone showed up. I enjoyed the work as a team. I enjoyed management. I learned how to run a store by myself on many occasions, receive a truck, unload U-boats for the driver, check in vendors, and wait on customers all at the same time! I learned to work a lot out by experience and I walked away with a better outlook on business period."
bad,I worked for Dollar General for 7 years. At first i loved my job couldn't wait to get to work every day. Then they started to push more and more work on the manager and cut store hours to the point that i was working between 60-70 hours a week. but i was on salary for 40 hours and was not paid for over time. overall i loved my customers and enjoyed seeing many of them everyday. with working so many hours and usually having to work alone due to hours being cut. i became burnt out on the job.
bad,"Very busy,not having everything the customers are looking for"
bad,"long hours, weekends, holidays, lots of laboring work, bad pay, not enough employees, poor managment"
bad,"My supervisor started stealing from the cash register and blamed me for it. It was proven that she was helping her boyfriend take money and work without filling out an application. She was later, fired."
bad,Great place to work assistant managers exceptional .Managers and general managers they need better people. The best part of the job was the regular customers and the assistant managers
bad,"unrealistic expectations"
bad,Very disorganized company. Managment always had cold feet. Turnovers like crazy. Employees lack in performance due to min wage pay. Theft is on a daily basis by employees and customers. Stores are usually placed in ghetto areas so the clientelle are very rude and obnocsious. Constant threats by both managment and cutomers. Overall very sucky job...
bad,"First off let me just say that I have never felt the need to write a review of an employer before but I am hoping that this review will reach someone and redirect them into another path. For 6 months I was lied to and told that I could not be promoted from ASM to SM because my manager needed me to badly. My DM told me that I was the backbone of the store and that the store would collapse if I was to leave......OK??? So, I get held back because you hired someone who is incompetent?!?!? The store that I worked in was a crisis store which meant it had issues with things such as high shrink. The store was a disaster but with a lot of devotion from me and several different leads, the store was able to pull through it. I had a manager who thought her only job was paperwork. Sadly enough she is still there. Anyway, I took my chain of command and addressed some very unethical issues that were emerging from the store due to my manager. Guess what.....not only did my DM blow me off, so did my regional manager. The pay is pathetic for the amount of work expected of your. $10/hr for the work I did was ridiculous! Just a lot of suits sitting back getting their pockets padded. DG does NOT take care of their employees and the open door policy is a joke! Save yourself the aggravation and search elsewhere! DG is ranked one of the worst places to work in the US...now I see why!!"
bad,"•	As the store manager; I managed to improve the overall cleanliness conditions of my store immediately. I encouraged my staff to keep shelves stocked and clean as well as floors, check outs, bathrooms, stock room and recover store daily."
bad,"I worked at this store for about two and a half years. When I finally decided I wanted to leave, the manager knew about 2-3 weeks in advance that I no longer wished to work there. I did not, however, give a two-weeks notice. The management acted as if I was making the biggest mistake by quitting. I had been there longer than anyone besides the store manager and another cashier. I wasn't being treated fairly with the management, and when I told them I no longer wanted to work there, they quit associating with me. Not to mention, the people that do work there still, do not greet the customers when they come in and are 90% of the time rude."
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked. I have been in retail my whole life and I would not recommend this place to anybody. They work you to death and the pay sucks.
bad,work your rear off for nothing
bad,Ran the cash register that I basically had to learn by myself. Worked daytime hours. The manager back in 2004 was very rude she always watched black and hispanic people and never sent help when the store had a lot of customers.
bad,It was a nice that i loved to work I meet new people very day .I did do alot of things in the store I that I never was told to do But was told that i did do a nice job on it .
bad,These stores are poorly operated always left a mess by prior manager. Your expected to clean it up...everyone involved knows nothing accept who the individual that takes the fall is..no it was not me thank god but this is truly sad.too many companies no help yet keep building!
bad,Manager isnt very nice. Fires people for no reason. The manager will put in the wrong amount of hours youve worked. The store has roaches amd the manager does nothing about it. The only good thing about working there is 2 of the other workers are really nice
bad,"The store gets robbed on a regular basis. And they take security as a joke. Hour availability is not what it should be!!!!.........,................"
bad,There is a lot of heavy lifting and when not picked fast enough you’ll get wrote up for it. There has been a lot of workers hired and quit soon after. Very hard work it’s too much
bad,"Work expectations way exceed salary and compensation. When I was hired on, was given the impression of how much they cared about their employees. As time went on, I learn every day that is not the case."
bad,The company does not value their employees. They do not give raises or promote fairly.  They have management who steal hours and adjust their employee's hours before submitting their time.
bad,"Horrible management, no motivation  constantly stressed, currently in school and I get yelled at for having to go to school. Probably the worst job I’ve ever had."
bad,The pay is so bad. I make more on SSI then I did with DG. Its not managements fault its the company. They pay you almost nothing. Its starvation wages. You cant pay rent and pay to eat if you work here alone. each check I would get 100 - 200. That's nothing.
bad,Managers are expected to work very long hours for little pay. Sometimes working as much as 80 hrs a week for salary pay. Always working short staffed so you have no choice but to put in all the hours. You are literally running from the moment you get to work till you leave. I worked many 12 to 16 hr days and even lost 20 hrs of vacation because my DM told me that I couldn’t go on vacation with my store being short handed (even though there never was a time that we weren’t) so I lost it. The manager and the assistant manager are basically run ragged till they burn out and quit. Then they start all over again with a fresh new hire.
bad,"short staffed, freight not being worked, compacted back room out onto the floor, bathroom door did not lock, no customer bathroom, constant theft, one register opened, back and forth on info from management to district managers."
bad,"I do not hate my job, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Unless you just need to work there through schooling or something. I lose sleep over the stress from that place."
bad,(First let me tell you you can’t edit The bottom of the paragraph So it’s all combined together weirdly)Basically if you don’t want to have a life go ahead and work there I was the store manager you’re required to work 48 hours a week but if someone calls in oh well you have to work more and most generally you already work more than your 48. It’s just tough boss was good in the beginning still was in the end but things got rough I asked for help it wasn’t ever given. I will miss my customers more than anythingMany times I felt the need the only choice was to walk out but that was the corner I was backed into  the pay was good and the benefits were good and I made good friends
bad,"I go into work and do what I am asked but here lately I feel as nothing I do is very appreciated so I'm seeking other opportunities. I have learned many things working at Dollar General such as working well with others, time management, how to manage a store to be very productive and also how to watch a store be run down with poor management. The hardest part of the job is never being able to work as a team anymore because people are too busy trying to always make themselves look better instead of coming together and doing things as one store. The most enjoyable part of the job is now going home or going to lunch."
bad,"Customers are great and dedicated to Dollar general, the company wants a certain amount of employees but only wants to give them 10 to 15 hours as far as the gm. They schedule you 6 days they say 5 and a half but the half  turns into a A full then  forbid someone calls out on. Your day off because your required to go in.   So in short as a gm they don't care about you they care about labor hours."
bad,Dollar General was ok to work at just the demand for production was so high that it was hard to achieve. The management was looking at numbers off papers and not actual people doing the job
bad,It's not bad . Just you get so little pay for all the work they want done and management  didn't really care how you felt . Or if you had a problem ..
bad,"The dollar General doesn’t treat their employees well, they have a huge work with limited staff and hours, no over time. They want the truck to be unloaded while the store is open during business hours with two people usually unloading 1500 pieces. It’s hard work for the amount of work you do and not even get paid higher then minimum wage. They want sales associate to ring up customer while work on Toto’s and changing prices. It’s basically impossible to ever complete anything if you work at a dollar general in a high volume area."
bad,"The work load was easy, sometimes customers could be rude. The only downfall of the workload is you are responsible for stocking while watching the register. The thing hardest for me was being alone in the morning for about 5 hours and it got overwhelming when there were angry customers waiting and the delivery guys waiting to be checked in. The hours weren't terrible, did get to be tiring being there for 8+ hours a day. I did learn a few things that will help at future jobs however I was assistant store manager and didn't learn any manager type things and was basically at the same level as the full time sales associate. The store manager talked very poorly of her employees including the assistant managers. There was way too much negative gossip for a bunch of grown women. It made going to work miserable when your superior would talk badly of you and your work ethic to other employees."
bad,"Never have a personal life!!"
bad,In June of last year I was hired on as a cashier. Within three months I was promoted a key holder. I was doing good all the way up until January. I had some very bad stuff happened in January to me and my kids. Then the February I was robbed a Gunpoint .  After everything happened to me and my kids. They start looking down on me and writing me up for stupid stuff and talking bad about me and giving me attitude. But I was one of the employees I tried their hardest to get everything done. I just now put my two week notice in and I can’t wait to leave. It is not worth the stress at all. I go to work every day stress.  They do not care about your personal life. I’ve me I’m a single mother and I’m homeless. And they would not compromise with me. I will never work for this place again.  They keep hiring new employees but then they leave. And I expect you to run the store by yourself on a busy day. They make you do the job of four people. And if you don’t get all your work done you get wrote up.
bad,Store managers are overworked. High turnover because all other employees are paid minimum wage with no benefits. Only employees who stay are usually lazy and there because they don’t have transportation to other places ( they walk it get rides & call out a lot) . Workload is unrealistic. The stores get monthly visits rated on a scale of 1-10 with 5 being the best!!!!! Corporate knows 10 is unattainable but does nothing to get more payroll hours or competitive pay for good employees.  Any store without a store manager for more than a week turns into a disaster.
bad,I started dollar general as a second job. I worked morning days and nights. I did stocking and cashiering. I enjoyed the people I worked with for the most part. I didn't see a future in dollar general for me and did not like that they did not offer holiday sick or vacation time.
bad,"Job pays pretty good but not enough to be satisfied with working 6 days a week, very little family time and dictatorship of when and when not to use PTO"
bad,"Worked for DG for almost two years and was suspended for following DM's instruction. I ended up resigning because noone would call me after the suspension, not even HR."
bad,"Never work for Dollar General they only care about making money and not about their employees. And yes to a previous comment I read about a place in Texas about getting fired for riding in an ambulance is possible. I had full blown seizures at work and my manager was to busy outside smoking  to come to my aid . If it had not if been for the customers 911 would not even have been called my manager just came in and started checking customers out with no concern for  me then was made to take medical leave and brought back with s release to return to work from my doctor only to be fired . DG turn over rate is unbelievable and once you experience working with them you soon find out why !!! From Post, Tx."
bad,"Low pay for high responsibility. Customers can be un-balanced and get you fired because they are having a psychotic break. Company takes any customers' word that you should be fired. No matter how hard you work, If you don't give a customer the price they want they can get you fired. So basically  customers set their own prices or threaten you with a call to corporate."
bad,"This job allows you to see people from many walks of life, and requires that you speak with them, this can create a slightly saddening work environment which requires sympathy and kind behavior regardless of the way you are treated. Your feelings will not be taken into account."
bad,"Would not recommend this place unless all you want is to be tired and angry off all the time. The money is good but they work you to death, money isn't everything."
bad,"I enjoyed the work at Dollar General. There was a lot of stocking and customer interaction. Unfortunately, their expectations are next to impossible to complete.They keep demanding more work is done but they do not want to compensate their employees for the work that they do and they will not staff the store according to needs."
bad,"the district manager took awhile to reply back to team members,some of managers didn't do they jobs.some team members were not on the same page.lack of security for employees.my location got robbed twice in afew months spand"
bad,Dollar General was not the best job i choice to work at. It just wasn't for me. i wish i would of pick a better job. i wanted a job with better career growth opportunities.
bad,Don’t consider working there anymore. Too many working hours. Not enough pay for the work. Too much mandatory OT. None voluntary overtime. Almost the whole time I’ve worked there was 12 hours. Not a family oriented company like they preach. Management doesn’t communicate well with hourly employees. Management constantly threaten to work weekends
bad,"I was so excited to get to work down the road from where I lived as that meant less time on the road and less gas. Upper management was horrible! They expect too much from employees, meaning they expect the impossible. Not enough staff to complete the tasks on each shift. When things weren't done to their liking, people were written up or let go, regardless of the expectations that were passed down the chain. I would never recommend anyone work for Dollar General, let alone shop from them. I can't support a business that can't support their employees."
bad,really don't have to many nice things to say about DG they have a ridiculous policy on their raises which does not give employee's an incentive to work hard.
bad,Expectations are to high for what the employees are to do. Very stressful and to much drama! Job is enjoyable if you like to work with the public and doing non-stop work.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job would honestly be most of my customers and the bond you make with them. They are all so different in their own way and that makes the bond worth every minute spent with that customer. Knowing your customers can also make you understand them and give the help they need whether it be to shop for them or what they are needing. My customers was my personal favorite.
bad,"degrading, humiliating,   "
bad,"I had a wonderful manager and assistant manager. The problem was not with them, it was with the hours , I was lucky if I got 27 hours a week, and they could raise the amount per hour also. I also think they should drug test on occasion. I do think they could do something about the way u train someone who has never be around a regestire. Also better benefits for familys."
bad,I loved this job! You meet new people all the time. I loved my customers! Management is not that great. The hardest part of this job is having to be alone for a few hours but I loved my employees because we always worked as a team!
bad,I did not like working at the Dollar General at my location whatsoever. The manager was not very nice and the pay sucked. If you are working at dollar general as a sales Associate to pay your bills then I’m sorry. The customers I had to deal with on a daily basis were not good either. I would not recommend working for this company to my worst enemy.
bad,Job offer little hours however management expect work load to be completed. This company is impossible with how they run their operations. I feared for my life working there.
bad,I FIRST started working at dollar general  the end of march 2016 i liked it. i liked the people I worked with I really liked my boss and then as the year went on I started to notice my boss took other people's side it's full of drama and She was trying her hardest to get me fired or get me to quit for what reason I'm not quit sure. Im a good employee I showed up did my job covered for other people. I'm very unhappy with the way in was treated in the following months leading up to me quitting.
bad,Working for Dollar general is very stressful. They do not let you balance home and work life. Not good for me since I was a single mother of a 9 yr old son.
bad,"I worked for 16 years for them after I had major health issues I couldn't keep up my %, they requited you to have 95% But  I could only get 89 to 90% they do not care about there employees health or welfare all they care about is getting out there product"
bad,"Employees are over worked and understaffed. Employees are expected to do work that typically requires 3 or 4 people alone and in a short amount of time. Management doesn't do much. All managers work in the morning and leave a keyholder with one cashier at night to assist customers, stock and clean which is pretty much impossible given the store is pretty busy."
bad,Company isn't concerned with work/life balance and ignorant to challenges employees in the field face. No sense of urgency to fix maintenance issues in the stores.
bad,I really loved the job and the things i was doing. My husband started working there a couple weeks after me and the manager fired me because she needed a manager and he had managers experience.
bad,"If you like write ups after busting your backside and doing what your boss told you to do its great.   Recovery only after 5pm first time told juat two days ago. But the write up sticks because I been there long enough to know.    Yep you heard it.  We were promised almost 20 extra hours to pull christmas and put up valentines.  Not only did we not get the hours. They are cutting our hours now.  Managers are left alone for 2 - 4 hours a day.  Its not safe and if something were to happen we most likely get blame.  "
bad,management puts too much on the shift managers to complete on extremely busy nights. some cashiers get paid more than the shift managers. when you can get everthing done its a slow day. but on busy days they want you to do everything and run as cashier
bad,poor managed . could care less about their employees just get the product worked. managers make constant remark s that are what outside guidelines and nothing happens to them but the employee gets in trouble.
bad,"upper level management doesnt respect the vast majority of their employees, setting unrealistic expectations for highly understaffed stores. complete disregard for orders to travel to various stores. in store management is otherwise great."
bad,"The pay was low, working at the cashier you had a lot of duties to day with just one person. At the end of the day you had to mop the entire store by yourself without any help"
bad,I hate the place. I will never  work there again and I will not tell or ask someone I know or hate work there. Do that answer your question. The hours are fine.
bad,"place was a mess to work at. "
bad,"The employees here are all overworked and underpaid.  Their main concern is with meeting payroll, and at the same time putting any extra work on their salaried managers."
bad,A job that keeps you moving at all times. It taught me patience & the ability to handle many tasks at once. Managers have to be able to achieve MANY tasks with minimal staff and payroll.
bad,"Dollar General is the worst company to work for they literally tell you in your training video that the believe you are going to steal from them they want you to get each costumer to spend at least 10 dollars or your ""basket"" could get you fired"
bad,"Awful management"
bad,"Was an assistant manager position, however I ended up doing pretty much everything due to loose and lazy store management. I was in charge of scheduling, inventory, cash reconciliation, product setup and placement ... basically I was doing the work of the store manager, just not getting paid for it."
bad,"The location I was employed at was messy, had no structure, and was very stressful. The associate tasked with training me most of the time did everything but that."
bad,"Receive truck, ring on registers, planograms, seasonal sets, markdowns, ordering, cash accountability, conference calls, Answering to all District manager calls and meetings. Interviewing for my store and other locations. Was relocated to three locations to hire and fire old staff."
bad,"Hours vary, what hours are given don't go over 20 hours a week for cashiers, and are as litltle as 6-8 hours a week. The payroll department is a pain to deal with if they mess up your bank account numbers"
bad,Training was not reasonable for positions that individuals were being hired for . Hourly employees were often times asked to work off the clock to get projects done.
bad,The management team was very hard to work with because they would change minds a lot. The co-workers were very nice though and very helpful were the management lacked. The hardest part of the job was to communicate with the management.
bad,"a typical day consist of hoping people show up to work. Customers are customers most are great though. I learned that if you don""t play ball you get canned. Most mgmt. don't know what they are doing and pay is horrible. The hardest part of the job is babysitting the associates and working until your dizzy from lack of sleep from working 83 hrs a week or more."
bad,Dollar general was a horrible company to work for. The higher ups didn't care for their employees or customers. I hated that.
bad,"My first day working I was taught how to run register for about 15 minutes then I was left to run register by myself. I had to run back and forth through the store stocking shelves and ringing up customers on the register. The third day I was transferred to another location (not that far but still) where I pretty much was alone in the store having to ring up customers and also go around and tidy up the store. When I went back to my main store another employee had to mop the store since I did it the day before, but she was texting and talking on her phone so much she made me mop the entire store even though I just went around with an entire cart of shop backs. They also had me doing full-time hours when I was written down as part-time."
bad,"stocking the shelves, making sure the floor or net and clean, and making sure everything is full and pack. and putting up back stock and making sure the back is net."
bad,"long days "
bad,It was some good day and bad day. I have learned form the best and will not forget the people in the company.
bad,I started out as a key holder. I was promoted to assistant manager after not even a year and the manager left because the dm drove them away. After the manager left i was working every day sometimes 16 hours because I did not have the security level in the computer to hire employees and the dm put it off. Anytime you have returns or voids you are accused of being a thief. We were very short staffed and tight on hours without a manager and upper management could not understand why we fell behind.I had only been working with dg for about 5 months and was running the store since we were lacking a manager. Once the manager started i closed every shift working until 1030 pm not getting home until 11pm. I had no personal life because of all the closing shifts and became very unhappy. Payroll was also very low so my paychecks made it hard to pay bills and make a living with the hours i was given.
bad,A typical day a work consisted of making sure our customers left happy. It's a very fast paced and physical job. It could be very rewarding however their was no consideration on a company level for employees to have time off to enjoy life or family.
bad,"I got this job back my senior year in high school, and at the time I enjoyed it. The work was simple enough to learn, yet complicated enough so not EVERYONE could learn it. The co-workers and customers were generally friendly and the work was relatively enjoyable. "
bad,I got a job here to help pay some bills soon after i started the night shift mngr begin to flirt and woukd cuss infront of customers and the littlest smallest thing would make him made they r very unprofessional n i quit a few days later because the pay wasnt worth the drive or the stress
bad,"Dollar General is the worst place i have every worked for they treat the managers like the dirt and the stores like dirt, the dont pay you what they owe you and think thats its ok to walk all over you and you can be doing great and have the store running great and be the best store they have and they will just yell at you and not care."
bad,I got to meet a lot of great people that are regulars. Truck day is Tuesday and its difficult trying to stock the shelves and stay out the customers way to shop but as long as you are willing to get them what they need they are fine with it.
bad,tha production level that was asked was not well thought out by management staff dollar general has a high turnover rate due to that production precentage
bad,"This company has lost value of family, and customer service. They might send an email on customer focus. But the real world inside a Dollar General store is almost gone. With no hours to run the store properly and always being asked to cut them in the middle of the week, putting out truck and setting planograms. Which should be done way before seasonal but they like to stretch it out so it can just pile up on you, and oops don't call your DM he's backed up to and don't know what to do, just get it done. Need maintenance for floors or air well.... Wait till next quarter not in the budget this quarter. This is absolute the WORST company to work for now. At one time they were the best. When they held to their values and not just the dollar. Talk to exerting managers out there before applying."
bad,"Management would have 40-50 hours, but I would have maybe 20. They would schedule me to close at 9:30-10pm and then come in at 4am to run the truck. I enjoyed stocking and being a cashier working with the customers. I was very friendly and a hard worker. They also told me that breaks were priviledges and if anyone was late they lost their priviledge to take a break that day."
bad,"8 rolltainers full of freight,2 employee's in the store, youve got to run a register assist customer's then try to put up merchandise, not enough time in day to complete the job. Management wants a profit but not willing to not burn out its management at the store."
bad,Dollat general is a fast paced job. You have to be ready to work hard and get a lot done. My experience there I was over worked for what I was getting paid (which was the cashiers pay.) I did more than what my job requires most of the time and I put up with harrassment the whole time I was there.
bad,"Has good management, always clean good customer service. Gave good hours , the customer was very rude at times but nonething  i was not able to handle"
bad,"I really enjoyed working with this company and really wanted to run my own store. After 2 years and getting pasted over Many times, I pushed even harder and put myself infront of the DM. The DM for that area wants no time for anyone but himself unless he knows you. When I put it on the line of being a SM in the store in my area some things was said that was very upsetting. I couldnt believe how he seen me. But it helpped me see that the company was the place for me if the DM couldnt see the 200% I have. My family and job has always been a big thing for me. I know my worth and want to learn anything new but his insite of me was way off not to mention the thinhs he said was based off of another co-worker."
bad,"Bad costumer to employee ratio, hectic scene, and not enough hours. 15 hours a week on minimum wage, is ridiculous. My assistant manager I work with slacks off a lot so I end up doing the majority of everything. Also was barely taught anything and almost nothing about using a register or where things are at."
bad,"Underappreciated and not able to pay associates a competitive wage so you get stuck with employees no other company wants...they usually only last long enough to get a few pay checks. $60k after bonuses sounds good, but if you work almost 70 hours/week it's not. You could work 2 full time jobs and make more money and have less stress"
bad,"I worked My butt off at Dollar General.They make you cashier,stock,clean and do 1,000 at once and don’t pay you enough for it.Store director and some manager have favoritism.Just felt no matter how hard you work it wasn’t enough.I loved the customers and helping people."
bad,"Poor management and dishonesty issues. I spoke to my GM about the issues and she didn't do anything to address the problems with staff or DM. "
bad,"Must work no less then 50 hours a week, sometimes 16 hour days. Physically demanding. Multiple tasks to be performed at the same time, no work / home life balance."
bad,"I started out as a cashier, and i was easily able to move up the ladder because of my dedication and effectiveness compared to the lax nature of most applicants and employees."
bad,"Their expectations are very high! Long hours. So many people call in so you have to work doubles even tho over time is not approved. Store manager takes advantage of employees and works them to death all while she gets credit for everything. I’ve experienced and good manager and bad manager with DG. If you have a great manager who is willing to teach you and help you gyou don’t then it’s not worth it. Don’t apply! Leave, quit, walk out! They won’t miss you! row with the company then GREAT! If"
bad,Hours are horrible. You can only start part time. Its great at first then gets incredibly stressful. Managers work 60+ hrs a week at a salary rate that's not really worth it.
bad,"I’m a store manager with Dollar General and I can honestly say out of my 10 years of management experience, this is the worse company I’ve ever worked for. There is absolutely no work/life balance. Working 50 plus hours a week with one day off will burn you out quickly. The expectations of their managers are unrealistic. Managers do it all; run the register, stock, and operate a store. The work load is heavy with resets, lots of freight, tasks sent by corporate but the labor budget is the bare minimum. The pay is not competitive for employees therefor the morale is low and the turnover rate is extremely high. The lack of security the company provides shows they do not care for their employees. And let’s not mention the old computer systems and technology they use to operate. It’s daily frustrations and stress, you are set up to fail and they want you to basically kill yourself to succeed."
bad,Alright but very casual and not at all professional.  The customers can be friendly or doped out crack heads and management/corporate doesn't care about you.  In fact there have already been a few employees quit who were physically allergic to the place one of them was actually in the hospital so many times their doctor made them quit this place. Something about the building. All if not most of the employees have noted rashes and infections that flare up after prolonged hours here at the 720 Rt. 9 Bayville DG
bad,"Dollar General expects its managers to put in however many hours a week to get the job done. The problem is that you are in the store alone or with one other person the majority of the time. If someone calls out, the manager is expected to cover that shift if no one else can. I worked 65 to 80 hours a week due to budget cuts and the required tasks that needed to be completed."
bad,"You are better off working anywhere but here. The pay is atrocious and the work is not justified by the pay. I only stayed because the crew I worked with was great but since they are leaving, I have decided to leave as well."
bad,Not enough hours to properly do the job. Worked 70 to 80 hours a week.  Seldom got more than 2 days off a month. Inventory is excessive and not well timed seasonally.
bad,"I have seen it all when working here from being locked out of the building due to the SM(Store Manager quitting) and the countless assistant managers, other key holders and sales associates. From the time I worked there (2016) and returned in (2018-2019 was a mistake) nearly over 70 people in the time frame (3 store managers within 5 years since I have seen that DG) leaving to due to the workload that they want us to get done, the paid and the customer base or doing NOTHING to PEOPLE WHO SHOPLIFT. The district doesn't care about the stores only when they want another DG built instead of taking the time to care of the countless employees who have to suffer from customers, faulty computer systems and overworked hours. The only thing about the job was the customer interactions depends if they were the talkative type depending on what mood they were in. But for the people who have no life (not being mean) and want to work 10 plus hours days with no honor for it and If you want to have a fast career and getting promoted wait 2 days there might be an opening for you soon."
bad,"If you are looking for a part time job while in college it’s fine . If you looking for a career and want to spend every moment of your life there . It’s right up your ally . If you want any life out side of that forget it. Constant employe turn over caused by call outs and no call no show . The fact you can’t fire anyone till they have commented the same act 3 times .  The employees know the manager is basically trapped in the loop of fire them and do the work your self or hope they do something. you can’t just simply let them go for bad performance ,and it leaves you in a prison of  hopelessness. Till you eventually have had enough and apply else where. No payroll means either your going to be there all day . The alternative is the be constantly over budget . Don’t get me wrong I personal can do the truck skyselves check in vendors and do the schedule run register and keep it clean by my self . Does this mean I’m willing to for so little money . Not any more. Know your worth . Anyone who tells you different about this company either dint work there long enough or lives to be at work 24-7"
bad,the store was always behind and the management was absolutely awful it was a good job at first but after awhile of seeing how bad it really was it was obvious I needed to get out of there.
bad,"what I did like about the job is, you see all kinds of people. talk with them as your cashing the customer out and as well helping them with anything they need. I lobe organizing the material. I did like one of the manager she was helpful and nice.. what I disliked about the place.. the mane manager who was there was mean and unfriendly. did not like we only had two people working at a time so, when a lot of people came in at once it was very over well. we had one robbery and the man took the money who had a gun. there no protection there be safe as well.."
bad,Very nice and easy workplace I never had a problem about this job I met a brunch of people and saw many people I knew but never kelp me from doing my job
bad,"As a field leader who is empathetic and supports empowerment for my team, Dollar General has disappointing and unprofessional cons. Unethical practices with personnel management,  inconsistencies with policy accountability or policies not uniformly enforced and training inconsistencies affecting development of future leaders. The company selects external candidates for most internal promote roles."
bad,It’s not a great place to work when management don’t want to do ther job! I work in the store from sun up to sun down many of days with just one cashier and myself! Call store manager she didn’t care! It’s not fair to be treated like your life is not important.
bad,This company is okay to work for as a first job. You get paid weekly but don't receive any discounts as an employee. During the time I worked for Dollar General we had three different store managers.
bad,"The Dollar General in Lumberton Tx is not the best company to work for.  Almost all the management  that works there relies on others to do their jobs while they sit in the office getting paid to do nothing. also there is no benefits, no insurance. if you don't smoke you don't get a break. If you move up to a manger position all you get is a 50 cents raise there is no moving up or getting a raise after that."
bad,I like the job but I do not make enough to support myself only working two or three times a day. It is a easy job stocking and counting money but it can take time and customers can be very rude at times for no reason.
bad,Think before applying. The pay is very low and the work load is very high. It’s a good temporary option while looking for something better. As a manager I was expected to be there all the time and it didn’t matter if I had a day off. Being it a salaried position it always seemed the company got more out of it than you do.
bad,There was always too much to do and no time to do it. Managers are worked too hard for way too little money. Way too much was expected for the money paid. NEVER would I work there again. Theft was rampant because there were never enough employees to cover the amount of work that needed to be done. This also explains why the stores are a mess.
bad,"It was okay. I feel my manager was slightly racist. She would make references to ""Porch Monkeys"" and when black people come in she would reference them as ""those people"". Or follow them over the store until they left. So I found another job. Also I was WAAAY over qualified and the ONLY person who was getting under paid."
bad,you are a number not a person at this company.  managers work week are 48+ hrs a week.  if you enjoy working and no home life this is for you. very low hrs to distribute to other employees so you as the manager are required to fill those spots on top of your own.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company for anyone looking for a career in retail management,this company has an extremely high turn over rate,and the stores are not clean and very much over crowded with merchandise. And the district is very poorly staffed"
bad,"Typical day at work included doing cashier work, cleaning, stocking,etc basically everything for very low pay. You get over worked for basically no pay to provide a lifestyle for yourself."
bad,"Worst store in the district. Very unorganized, store was always untidy, & dirty. I always found myself tidying up no one else cared how it looked... Bathroom disgusting. Shift leaders rude, don't do their jobs with assisting you when needed. Manager a mess. I'll never work for that one again the best one to work at is on 4th st or on Lakeview."
bad,"Started working at the Hope Ar Dollar General the end of December of 2015. I really liked the people I worked with, but there wasn't a Manager and the store was a disaster. I went through several managers while working there for the eight months and all I got along with, but I guess they were not best for the store. I love all the regular customers and will greatly miss them, but I will not miss this job. I did my job. I was still in High School when I started there and as soon as a graduated, I got put as a key holder. I closed pretty much every night, but never got officially put in the system as a key holder, so I never got paid for my time as a key holder. Which is completely wrong. We recently got a new manager (surprise) and we got along and he even praised me for the work I did. Mind you, the store is still a disaster and I'm still closing every night and not getting paid for it. I called into work for the fist time yesterday, and he told me that if I don't come then he will let me go. So I left. Nothing is right in this company or maybe it's just the Hope one, but things are not done right. I lost my job over something stupid and I will probably never get paid for all the months I was a key holder. I advise you not to work here if you can help it. Not because of the co workers, because they are all friendly, but because of the managers and the people above him that don't care about the shape of the store or their workers."
bad,"I was the store manager and spent at least 40 hours out of the 60 hours I worked a lone doing the register, stocking, P.O.G , cleaning as well as serving the customers.  worst job I have ever had"
bad,"Although I have been told this company was at one time great, it is failing a lot of good employees. It was sad to leave, due to liking my staff and the initial job."
bad,I worked one day a week stocking.There were time restraints for stocking to one 4 hour day.
bad,"Over worked,  underpaid, no benefits, "
bad,Be prepared to do the work of 5 people and get paid very low wage. Cashier makes barely over minimum wage for 10-15 hours a week.  Not worth the STRESS that comes with the job.  Not a good job if you are supporting a family.
bad,Unfortunately this was another job we are has them manager was overworked underpaid and stress and that was like that in his performance as well as the employees he was training there was never a distinct let’s schedule there was never any compromising with employees as far as working days or nights the store would just be closed and not to Mention the customers behaviors in the stealing was to the point where your life is at risk where the unsafd
bad,First week I went with 45 hours then next week was 25 and finally the next 2 weeks was only 5 hours per week. I had asked for more and they told me they can try to get me more. How is anyone supposed to survive with 5 hours a week.
bad,Pay sucks but very good people to work with. Don't give much time for task. And ask you to do way to much stuff that does not go with your time very well.
bad,"A typical day  is coming to work and opening the store. Going through nightly receipts, storing them properly,  cleaning up begind the night employee's, before I can begin my  initial work. Taking care of customs waiting for the cashier to start her shift,so I can begin  stocking freight, recovering, setting planograms planogramanything else needed"
bad,I thought DG was my forever but unfortunately I was a number to them. I had a mishap and all of a sudden I got the blame. They always change daily so you always feel like your not getting work done. High expectations for little salary manager. We had to do it all. Even with a strong team
bad,The store is always cluttered you barely can walk down the isles. They want to work you like you don’t have a life but pay you pennies. You literally only make enough to call it pocket change.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, its the saftey that came into play with recent robberies in our area .  I hope that in the future dollar general as a company can put in more measures to keep employees safe"
bad,$9 an hr for Manager on Duty is under paid & over worked boss is un practical it is a dirty store with blood on shelves people sling all over playing games & purposely trashing the store not enough cameras to actually solve the problem & the boss just doesn't care
bad,The entire experience from interview to working was a waste of time. I remain a loyal shopper of DG over family dollar (I use to work for) but there is a few stores that could use training DG on professionalism. I hate walking into store hearing radio blasting loud music
bad,Having to work 5 1/2 days per week wears on your body. No time to do anything outside of work. Biggest complaint really. I wouldn't be looking for alternate employment if this wasn't the case
bad,Go somewhere else. DG doesn't take care of the hourly associates in pay. Key holders or lead associates doesn't make the money they deserve! I was a manager and the only one in the store that made enough to get by .. The hours are long and at times only one person in the store
bad,Working at dollar general as a store manager you have no work/life balance.  I work upwards of 55 -70 hours a week for the same pay all the time.  Plus other retail stores pay assistants what i get paid as a store manager.  It doesnt take you long to figure out that they dont care about employees.
bad,"They ask for hard work and expect 110% effort, but pay incentive and being written up for every little thing made it near impossible to work. Management was nice, but the rest was utter nonsense."
bad,The company needs better incentives for employees and locations that are safer. Also allowing more hours for more employees to lessen the stress of getting all tasks completed. This will also allow more help with customers and their wait time.
bad,"It's impossible to accurately communicate how awful this job was."
bad,"You work as a slave! Not enough hours for payroll to keep your employees happy they cannot live off of under $100 a week so they end up leaving! People call off and the dms don’t care if you’re there 6am- 10pm everyday as long as the store is running! They don’t help you find coverage! Go on vacations and you have phone calls everyday! I have 4 kids and wasn’t ever able to see them due to having to be there so many hours a day to keep up with the store workflow and what ever they would add on to you thru the week on top of it! Would only have help at the register for about 4 hours each day and the rest of the time alone and can’t get things done! When my pap was passing I had to leave for a family emergency and couldn’t even get ahold of my dm to help me find someone to cover me to leave until I TOLD her I was just leaving! They do not care about you, they only care about not recieving their bonus! Too worried about customer service score when they should be worried about their employees because soon no one will want to work for them!"
bad,The company will abuse the management position because of the salary and my current Dm has forced me to oversee multiple stores but not give extra payroll
bad,"It was a great job to start, but it's definitely not a job that helps pay for anything, especially when you're a college student paying off tuition and you have no scholarship money or financial aid available. Good enough for high schoolers to start in. Management was great, but the company policies and expectations were ridiculous, especially the district manager. Six people in a large store and they kept piling on more policies and work when we were already short-staffed, but tried to make the best of it. Pay wasn't worth the arm-length list of stuff they had you do and customers/coupons were a common self-entitled pain in the butt."
bad,"It's a job, I'll say that. Not something you want to stay in for very long. Our corporate was awful to us, didn't care about any individual employees. Pay is garbage. Hours are flexible, and the coworkers I had were lovely. But we all knew how uncaring the company was."
bad,That store us a joke the management is horrible  it was close to home but the workers were catty and  lazy laying on top of the counter stealing  I enjoyed My customers that was it
bad,Its Close to home and workers get paid weekly. I like that its a small store and that everyone knows everyone. The work is easily learned and its part time.
bad,"You work 6 days a week and at least 10 hour days and still want more from you and only get one set salary always being called in on your one day off due to lack of employees as dollar general only pays the part timers  minimum wage and expect them to do a whole lot of work . You always have to over work ,and still always more that needs to be done.The most enjoyable part in the connivence of the location and having many customers that are like family cause they shop every day with you."
bad,"I would not work here again. They are always short staffed, the pay is low and overtime is not allowed. It's always busy and cannot reach customer satisfaction when there is not enough workers"
bad,"You do not get the hours your promised, the people you work for are not friendly, they have their picks. And you do not get paid enough to deal with the issues that they give to you to handle."
bad,I have nothing bad to say because im not that person but i will say it very low in wage and i think $1 more would make it just suitable. The managers were nice overall but theres not alot of room for growth.
bad,Dollar General only cares about the money. There employees are under trained and their turnover rate is the highest of any corporation.  This is a cut throat company.
bad,great processes if everything is working 100% which it never does.  No idea how to fix problems on a lasting basis and no patience or ability to be flexible with goals.
bad,"if your looking to be a lead or a manager save yourself the time and stress, managers are over worked and underpaid, I was working for 13 an hour and doing 50-70 hours a week even with the no overtime policy since my SM was never hiring and then was fired himself, without asking me I was looked on to run the store for 6 weeks as they found a new SM"
bad,"I really enjoyed the work environment and the friends I've made working there. It's very fast-paced and stressful at times. I don't think I'd recommend the job to anyone, but it's a great starting out job. Easy to move up in the company as well."
bad,"I love retail,  this job was fast paced and fun. Great customer service and out going attitude makes working in the community and with people a lot more enjoyable. My duties were manageable. I will say that management and assistants and other staff was the main problem for me. In problematic areas that have high loss prevention and criminal activity there seems to be daily dangerous situations that no employee should have to put up with. The pay is lower than fast food to start. Hours range from 4.5- 36 a week but never in my time has it gone over 26. Most weeks were under 15 hours a week. Key holders, a level up from cashier make only pennies more than NY state minimum wage. High turn over employees that there is never a strong team to keep up with the mass amounts of in and out products.  Just not worth it.."
bad,Dollar General is a great place to work a typical day is just assisting the customers with their shopping needs the hardest part about the job would be stocking all the shelves but what I learned is the duties of a Key holder.
bad,management hardly ever showed up except when the dm was gonna show then took credit for all our work. then only would schedule 1 person to open unload truck stock all shelves while waiting on customers and if you didn't have the whole truck unloaded and on shelves in 2 hours you were written up.
bad,"Horrible Management!!!!! "
bad,"The only decent thing I could say about Dollar General is that the experience gained from working there is quite handy. Aside from that it is not a place to go for employment if you are not prepared for poverty low income.    So going down the list here I shall offer my responses to suggested topics.  A typical day at Dollar General, day or night shift, is generally stressful.  You are expected to do a variety of tasks while maintaining customer service. This means a cashier has to both stock and organize while also dealing with people in line. This is not an efficient way to run things. I believe the majority of the stores are actually understaffed in that on average only two people run the whole store. This allows for very little to accomplish and thus is also the hardest part of the job.  Your typical atmosphere while, is cheery, for the most part. More often than not however there is also a lingering sense of disinterest. All I can offer on that point is to visit your local Dollar General and form your own opinion on the matter. Management in my opinion was actually top notch. They do the best they can with what they are allowed, so they can hardly receive all the fault for dilemmas that are otherwise out of their hands.   I'll wrap this up on a good note however. The experience gained from such a simple job is invaluable. The social interaction, the knowledge of running a register, learning how to identify and correct errors with manager present or otherwise.  The greatest thing I could say about Dollar General is it's a great place to boost experience especially if one"
bad,No workadvancement no proper training needs work and need to have a more stable work schedule. Enjoyed working with the customers and the location of the store
bad,"A typical day would be running a cash register greeting customers help when they need to find something stocking shelves when able. Pulling merchandise out on the side walk. I loved my manager she has a way with people. it is very busy.Corporate does not give   enough hours to adequately staff the stores.Cant get more than 20-23 hrs a week. No insurance unless you are full time. No paid holidays. no incentives, no discounts."
bad,Not really what you think this job would be. Very fast paced constant change not enough hours to work with.. good job for someone who doesn’t wanna have a social life
bad,"Management within the store was good, but when you get above that is when it gets bad.  The come in and tell you how to do something and then you get in trouble for doing just that."
bad,"The pay for employees is quite frankly not okay. Minimum wage to do the jobs of a manager. The only jobs employees of the store didn't do were my paperwork. Otherwise, they were treated like slaves."
bad,Dollar General has excellent benefits. The job culture and morale was extremely low. there was no work/ life balance for families with children and you did not get paid for working past 45 hours a week. the hours in a day would range from 9 hours to 18 hours work days with no overtime pay.
bad,"They expect more out of the workers than they are willing to pay, and only 4 hour shifts at a time. And if one shift doesn't pull their own weight and get stuff done, then it relies on the next shift"
bad,very horrible place to work the management is very rude to employees not a very likeable environment I will never go back to this company or ever work for them
bad,Worst job ive ever had. The managers are rude and selfish and inconsiderate. They genuinely dont care about their employees. The pay is awful. The work environment is awful. They will work you to death and pay you very little.
bad,Worked and didn't get paid for 120 hrs had to call labor board. Manager was amazing corporation a joke no care for employees work and look good no appreciation
bad,"One person trained me. He told me to do something that management said not to do. (Twice)"
bad,"Pay you nothing, make you work 70+ hours a week, don't give you hours for your employees to help you, don't let you pay your employees more than minimum wage, work you like a slave to where everyone always quits on you no matter what you do"
bad,Work well with scheduled. Expect too much on such little help they are willing to give. Long shifts and low help on truck days
bad,"Very poor management. No real job work/life balance. Never know how you're working from week to week. Low pay, to much work to do for that little pay."
bad,I like the work... However I told them I cant work Sundays and I worked every sunday. Also have a co-worker who hates me for no reason at all.... I get sick one night and call in sick and my co-workers don't speak to me all day... And at the end of their shift one employees  yells at me for missing a day. And accuse me of lying... I hate working there because of this one person she is mean to only certain employees...
bad,"a typical work day has a lot to make sure the store is stocked and the customers can find what they are looking for"
bad,"If you like to feel unappreciated, and like to be treated like you are not important...then, this is the job for you. The worst company to work for!!!!"
bad,Over all I use to love working here. My boss was mean and didn't like working with others school time. While working there my boss wanted me to come in and work and miss school!
bad,I enjopyed my time at Dollar General. The management was wonderful and everyone was willing to help until I got the hang of things.
bad,"I loved working for dollar general, because the store was small and in a small town, it was like the same people everyday and it is like you become attached to them.  If I had the opportunity to go back, I would."
bad,"This company is ok, they don't provide benifits nor paid vacations to their part-time employees. constant work with no rewards. "
bad,"I was treated horribly and even harassed by male manager, reported it to corporate and was harassed further for my disenchantment."
bad,This CAN be a great company depending on your department. Some are good - others are not. Promotions are possible as long as you play the political games. You must befriend people to get promoted. Not very friendly for minorities though.
bad,"A typical day at work included a verbally abusive assistant manager. I was told to not complain or bring up any suggestions by my store manager because she preferred to not deal with ""drama."" The stress I was enduring at work led me to quit my job at Dollar General less than three months after beginning there. I sorely needed the job to pay for my schooling but decided coming home in tears and the threats were enough. "
bad,"They start you out at 30 hrs, and promise 30 krs , then ater a few weeks cut you to 9 hrs and I went thru 4 managers in a 3 mth time."
bad,"I worked for this Company since April of 2012, and I left in August of 2012. The one where I worked was a joke. The manager never did anything she was always outside smoking or outside on the phone. She never stayed the hours that she was scheduled to. There were a number of times when I was suppose to work with her but she left early because she was tired. Even thought the manager hired three new people after me. I was the only one getting bad hours. I talked to her and she said that I was the lowest on on the totem pole. But yet the three she hired after me, ALWAYS got more hours then me. I don't know if it is this way at all the Dollar Generals but at the one where I worked Cashiers never counted out their drawers at the end of their shifts. The manager on duty did. The manager only got along with the Cashiers that kissed her but or are somehow related to her. Like I said this place is a joke. It is the worst place to work."
bad,"I was the store manager, I worked open to close 7 days a week for 8 months because the DM would not increase payroll enough to allow enough hours to schedule people."
bad,Dollar general is a good company to work for when you have a good manager and crew to work with . The health insurance though is way to high for the pay you receive and also becoming an assistant manager I was told alot of things but they never held up to their agreement
bad,"Not a place i wanted to continue my career."
bad,Good job just bad job skilled people. I think if they focused on getting workers to work together they could survive ! But until then they will not and it’s a shame.
bad,Horrible upper management no room for growth financially high turn over rate very strict company but dosent help you develop advanced career skills overall easy job
bad,"Worked there for years but barley got any sort of raise.  Management was really great.   However, they expect you to do the same thing the managers do but for less pay.  Over all, not the best place to work if you only have 1 job."
bad,"Look, I worked here for over four years.. They work really hard to keep making changes to better their employees but it just wont pay off until they change their minds on payroll budget allocation per stores. The payroll givin just simply isn’t enough to get the list of 1000 plus things accomplished every week.. it is an IMPOSSIBLE task and your work as the store’s leader isn’t ever appreciated. It usually went something like “ oh wow looks great! Here’s a list of 52 billion other things that i need you to do now, you have a week! Good luck!” They (district managers, regional directors & so on) are pushed with SO many different instructions and things to get accomplished in an UNREASONABLE amount of time and it seemed to always get PUSHED onto the store managers. There were only a handful of weeks where I put in 45 hours only. Most often i worked 60 hours a week, and there were plenty of weeks where i was putting in close to 80. I was a store manager for 2 and half years. I only had 2 full weeks of paid vacation and no sick days. I loved my job there as an ASM & LSA.. sales associate wasn’t enough to cover the bills and being a store manger just ruins your life unless you want to live and breathe dollar general."
bad,"Always at work due to people calling in, how to stalk properly and deal with money, poor management very disrespectful, good work culture besides getting yelled at"
bad,Dollar General needs to offer more payroll in ruff neginhbor hoods because we are busy watching shoplifters or busy cashing and frieght isnt getting done
bad,Always understaffed and horrible management no one to check dates on food. Not enough break time for managers. No one to cover shifts if necessary. Overall a bad experience
bad,Good first job but they were horrible with hours. The money isn't really good and atleast the dollar general I worked at was not clean and very small which made things clustered! I personally don't recommend.
bad,they work is easy and very fun. the customer are friendly and always nice and energetic. the staff is ok but not friendly all the time. I can manage work and home well
bad,The store managers at Dollar General have numerous reponsibilites and a lack of resources to complete in a timely manner and this makes it a stressful work environment and ruins the balance in their lives. The store managers are continuously trying to perform unreasonable tasks without help or enough allocated hours to complete.
bad,"days are sometimes long "
bad,When I was working there is was very unorganized and under poor management but they have recently remodeled and restaffed the entire store. So the store is probably in a way better state.
bad,Dollar general is a great place to work . Dollar general pay every week and some of the work are nice due depending on the area of employment and the management
bad,Over all this job is good for your 1st time working . There is room to grow in the company . The only bad thing your hours jumps up and down . You will never have a set off day.
bad,Clean store just not enough hours .. some friendly some not get a lot of business just not enough workers to keep a steady pace
bad,"Assisting employees and customers"
bad,The company is nothing about it's employees. I was spoiled working on a team before I transferred to Churchville
bad,"I worked in the Grayslake, IL location and after the new store manager came in things went from good to worse. She was overstaffed by hiring more than the maximum of employees needed for that store when corporate only allows eight employees per store. Also she hired her friends as spies which is bad for business. The last thing she did was mistreat the customers and employees by the way she talked to them."
bad,"I obtained this job through a previous manager. I was there for under six months when I was offered a management position. I was responsible for crew, stock, delivery, vendors, plan-o-grams shelf setting and knowledge of upcs and skus. I had moved out of the area and could not afford to travel back and forth. Start pay is 7.40 an hour and only 8.00 when you become a manager."
bad,The smaller stores are the best ones.  People were eating stuff and not paying for it along wtih so many rules had been broken.  I had seen that cashiers were being given keys that were not even suppose to have keys. People had safe combos that were not suppose to have safe combos.  When one the managers were told the only reply I got was ok and to my knowledge nothing was ever done about it.  They were hiring people in that had less experience than me but making more than I did.  If you want to work for Dollar general my advice is to stay with the smaller stores because the Market stores will run you over whereas the smaller stores actually go by the books and not do wahtever they want to
bad,"I was an Asst. Mgr. at Dollar General located on River Rd. in Columbus, GA. I worked with lazy people in management: who didn't work as a team and love to shift blame. The cashiers and stockers were very professional people. I quit because I feel that management should should be able to work as a team. If not, how can we lead by example."
bad,"Working for this company is very overwhelming and time consuming, there is no benefits in being a store manager, you are over worked and under appreciated, you have no home, work balance there is no time for yourself, you children, or your family. The DM's do not help, the job itself is very tiring and you never have enough hours t"
bad,"Dollar General are being built every day, and the employees are not making no more money. The starting salary for some cashier in some areas is $7.25. You get a raise once a year of 25 cents, no matter how good of a worker you are."
bad,They don’t care about the employees and they let a lot of people go because of really petty reasons along with removing pay after forcing people to step down
bad,you go in you do your job you go home no one really bothers you much as long as your a hard worker and get your job done your golden just don’t be sick and call off
bad,The manager took over a month to fix my payment and still hasn’t got it fixed and never scheduled me because he couldn’t pay me. He had to give me cash because direct deposit wouldn’t work
bad,"The people suck. They don't know what they are doing, and they are lazy. Store always dirty and not stocked bc people can't do their jobs. Management has NO idea how to run that store."
bad,"My supervisor was horrible. He constantly had an off putting attitude towards me. During the interview, he was very friendly but once I started working there it was a completely different story. Often I would be swamped with work, such as stocking shelves, helping customers and cleaning the store at the same time. Most of the time, it was just one cashier working. The store was fairly busy and severely understaffed. My supervisor would be in the back office, or taking personal calls while I was struggling to keep up with the influx of customers."
bad,Working here makes feel feel pretty worthless...I dont feel like I'm helping anyone and the pay is absolutely terrible. There are little hours to be scheduled. I barely bring home a paycheck.
bad,I started off making no $ a week couldn’t live so I took some step up to make more $ a key holder and after that Became a lot of  drama and concussion
bad,I enjoyed the manual labor I love stocking and my customers we were very busy often so as the manager on duty I had to solve spur of the moment situations often
bad,"The work there was just fine, i always made it to work on time an did everything i was supposed to do. Its just my co workers were always into it with each other. That made everyone else jobs harder. Even the general manager was doing her fair share of dirt."
bad,Not enough pay or hours poor management very rude customers and employees never show up to work on time. Managers wantedbto be tour friend and not ur boss and treat other employees different ways cuz of personal friendships
bad,"Hours get cut drastically during holiday season, rude customers get by with yelling at employees and theyre reviews punish the ones they yelled at and managment pats you on the back when your store is doing well saying good job keep earning me that extra money (regonal manager said that)"
bad,Dollar general is the worst company to work for.They have about 2-4 people working at a time and expect the world of their staff.Insanely high turn around time and honestly just not worth the trouble.The only good thing i can say about this company is that they pay weekly but depending on hours it sometimes isn’t worth it after taxes etc.Lazy management is common.find better
bad,It’s a very complicated environment. Dollar General isn’t the best place to work. They expect too much from you.  I do not recommend Dollar General to anyone.
bad,Worst place ive ever worked. Management was terrible pay was low for everything you had to do and hours were hard to get and whenvyou do work you had to the the stuff the shift before you couldnt finish plus yours.
bad,"Working for dollar general gave me experience in opening and closing the store, bank deposits, putting up the new adds weekly. Manager was not a very fair person. That being said it was the only reason why I quit working for them. I loved my job!"
bad,"Manager at store not flexible with schedules, nor reliable about getting the schedule to the employees with any advance (typically make schedules on Saturday and handed them out for only 1 week at a time.) I NEVER knew if I was supposed to work on saturday because the schedule was never made with any advance notice."
bad,"They don't treat the employees like humans, if you get something to drink and eat while on the job you have to purchase the product before you even take a sip or bite or they will fire you on the spot."
bad,"I took on different positions throughout my employment period, and I regretted all of them. The only thing that held me down were the bright and kinder spirited customers. Not even my paycheck made up for the amount of stress you go through. From infestations to uncomfortable managers, to strange perverted vendors. The job is too much for even the strongest of minds to handle. This is a last resort kind of job. Don't do it willingly."
bad,able to preformed their jobs yelling at employees in front of customers and wonders why they have a 75 + percent turnover rate at this store lose five people hire five people and in small towns or anywhere that is not proper management
bad,Working for dollar general was not one of the worst jobs but they need improvement regarding management wise. I had to deal with a very unprofessional manager and when I told the direct store manager he told he she’s the manager and it doesn’t matter.
bad,"Working for Dollar General I have learned a lot of things that I know has improved me for another work place. "
bad,"I do not recomend working at DG. Unless your just needing temporary employment or like a part time job. DG wants to run stores as top notch retail, but they do not offer competitive pay or hours to personnel. No bonuses for anyone under District Managers. Wanting tasks completed in a time frame that is barely achievable."
bad,Management behave like children. Numerous smoke breaks and as long as you were nice to the manager you could get away with anything. Hard work and dedication meant nothing. I will never shop at a dollar general again.
bad,Typical work day. Required dedication and self-motivation. Flexibility and leadership would be beneficial to any candidate looking to become a part of this corporation.
bad,"Everyone screams and curses at you."
bad,On a good day there were no  thieves for one  I learn about customer service team work work with others and work very hard Some managers  or pleasant to work with and then there was not a pleasant managers to work with  some people fall instructions   The hardest part of the job was communicating with managers Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and being at service to them
bad,Would never work there again they are very unprofessional play favoritism and steal your hours they don't ever give positive feedback and would walk all over you if you let them
bad,They treat you horribly and had to work under people that don’t know there own job. Reliable on the key holder for everything even to do a void or refund. There was only two people on and when they key holder went to lunch you were on your own. So if you had a void or price change you struck until that person was done with lunch. What a mess and company doesn’t care about the workers there. They need some lesson on how to work a company and maybe then they could keep emu there.couldn’t leave that place fast enough.
bad,"1.They over work you for less pay"
bad,"Not fair pay"
bad,"I have fibroid tumors and was told by the store manager, because I'm a manager I would have to be dead to call out... My customers were becoming concerned because I was always happy and now I look so sad... My customers told me to resign and take my life back... So I did... I sent a email to everyone in corporate explaining why I resigned... Stay far away from the slave trader...  The devil is busy... You must be busier... I'm glad I resigned... It opened up the door for me to get back in my medical field...Blessed... Stay blessed."
bad,Not a good place to work too much favoritism they do not train you proper they do not let you finish your classes managers be sending the employees to the bank when it's the manager's responsibility managers do not come in when they are schedule they take advantage of their positions Regional has a lot of favoritism to with some of the managers and if they don't like your performance they leave you bad with HR and when you do try to get a job it's hard for you to even get one
bad,I have a lot to complain about working here. Overall it’s a terrible job and it’s very tiring and the same thing every single day. I only got the job because I’ve known the manager my whole life.
bad,"Dollar General is a good company for school kids that need a little extra cash, no body would actually be able to live on the salary they provide. The workloads for employees making the bare minimum are crazy!"
bad,The store in Karns city pa has terrible management that’s why they can’t keep anyone!!! I loved my job and the store in Rimersburg pa is where I did my training and the manager there is awesome and so are the employee.
bad,Horrible place to work! Not enough staff to cover any shifts. I was hired in as assistant store manager and got little to no training what so ever. There are no consequences for bad behavior..call offs constantly.  Poor management and a poor district manager that favors certain people.
bad,"They work you to death, don't pay enough, and of course, you have a high risk of the store being robbed. The store worked at was robbed right before my shift. I was overlooked for advancement, although I did everything for the manager. Went to the bank, even on my days off, trained other employees, my husband stopped shoplifters. They fired me because a teenage girl who wanted to fit in and be best friends with the manager told lies about me and they believed her. But she thought she could talk  like she was boss and got fired herself. I guess it depends on the store and the manager, because I shop at other stores and they seem happy."
bad,"Made my mental health plummet straight into the mantle of the earth."
bad,It sucks. One manager working. Highly understaffed. The manager will literally leave you with a long line of customers then get mad because it's taking so long to check all of them out. They expect you to be able to do everything there at once as if you're two people. The management is horrible. They will cut your hours badly trying to bring in someone new when they could literally put you both on schedule to work.
bad,I was with this dollar general for 2.5 years. The customers were great but my manager constantly hired over me and talked poorly about me. The customers seemed to have the opposite opinion but my manager always took credit for the store reviews and ratings saying she did all the work. She ended up promoting me because she had no other options but then got me fired as soon as she found a female to replace me. She even paid the girl more than me starting out and she had been out of work 5 years. They claimed her resume overqualified her for the job so that why she was paid 4$/hour more than me but I think that my resume would be hard to beat for the position I was in. I was making 13.50$ at target and was a team leader before I was 18 and continued to work and manage retail stores my entire life to that point.
bad,I was an assistant manager and was worked to exhaustion.  My manager came in at 6:30 and left at 11.  Leaving me to work 10.5 hours and I had to take lunch but couldn't leave the store to eat.  I was a diabetic so this didn't work for me.  Working 9 days in a row and District Manager didn't care.
bad,Used and abused. Not sure how they can staff there stores. Higher expectations then are possible with the hours received. Even with higher pay I wouldn't go back.
bad,"busy"
bad,I was robbed at gun point and I was at the store alone. They would never give me the coverage where I wouldn't be at the store alone. They do not care about their employees. It's sad when you have a reliable employee that cares and you don't care about her.
bad,No Answer was not a good job.did not get enough hours after I was told this was a full time position. Had to get back pay because we were cheated out our money
bad,$8/HR for 5-6 hours per day is not worth your time nor energy and management expects top of the line work with little pay.  No adult can live off of that let alone care for their family.
bad,"I would never recommend working there  overworked for little pay horrible management who love  gossip,fights and argues with her Asst Manager will throw you under the bus any moment. Makes you work close then open the next morning early .  Puts impossible tasks to get done each day when you have customers to take care of along with the one and only cashier .Cannot keep staff as I see hiring signs all the time and the turn over is very high. Stay away!!!"
bad,"Stay awayLots of robberies, no protection or no panic buttons whatsoever . Safety comes first and when you hear your child crying for you not to go to work because she’s afraid you’re going to get robbed it breaks your heart so say Far far away as you can. Plus they want you to work off the clock which is very very illegal"
bad,Barely train anyone no communication no organization don't seem to care about their employees lack of direction from district just a terrible job experience all the way around
bad,"To much to do, not enough hours in the day and not enough people to do it. They don't hire enough people to do the job right. There is to much stock, it's placed all over the store in carts. Because no one can put up stock, It honestly hard to shop at the store."
bad,they let me work for 3 days then gave me no hours for 2 weeks then took me off the schedule without telling me i was fired at all. this place is terrible.
bad,Had issues with Store Manager placing personal issues above store  while on duty also spending more than her share of time doing nothing but talking n texting on her personal phone
bad,"I would not recommend this brick and mortar retail chain to anyone. You try for job advancement and they look you over as if you don't exist. If you need a job, don't go here."
bad,As a store manager you are worked to the bone if you want your store to succeed. I would not recommend them to another person. Unless they just wanted a part time job after school or something
bad,Wasnt too bad. I would go there for the morning shift. I would open the store and start the day by counting the safe and counting down the registers. Afterwards the second person come so that out of place items would be moved correctly. It isnt that busy in the morning.
bad,"I was a PT key holder and made $8/hr. My duties included stocking, recovering, cashiering, cleaning, etc. It wasn't a wholly terrible job, but I felt like I wasn't getting paid for the amount of work I was required to do. Management was excellent and everyone got along with each other, but sometimes I was given a lot of work and a very small time frame to do it in."
bad,"absolutely hated working here both times, was treated like a machine and not a person. was constanty yelled at for being slow whne busy even though I was on someone elses time. not paid for overtime, told to work on my days off or I was fired. pay is not worth it at all!"
bad,"The work was extremely physical and zero support from upper management for recruiting. Hot, broken equipment, poor working conditions, very labor intensive."
bad,"It was fine. You stock shelves and unload trucks that come in. ring people out and help them find things. On your feet a lot, so its nice you get to stay active."
bad,Not a safe place to work. Safety should be top priority if you cared about the employees there and not just your own well being. Robbed numerous times and still no security will be added. Horrible
bad,People were nice but the store was always behind and nothing was done.  Also seem lack of care for the job and some associates weren't getting proper training
bad,This place just robs you of your very soul. You work so much for peanuts. You're better going to a different chain all together. The place is never staffed.
bad,i will never ever work here againnnnn they are horrible .. under paid and horrible management .. i do not recommend working here .. customers are the only thing that made me wanna stay
bad,"6days i learned nurse work on cashier"
bad,Copeland was a great place to work everybody that reads your family without just moved out of state that's why I lost my job the food was great it was a great environment to be in and I never had a problem with another co-worker if I did I just reported to the manager and then everything was telling can you just a great place to be
bad,Absolutely poor management. Manager decided to use fowl language with me on the floor in front of customers and co-workers. Have not been in that store since.
bad,"Not enough structure, little room to improve or move up. Unfair hours; you (supposedly) move up hours depending on how much work you get done during your shifts. Managers have very little care for the store."
bad,I worked here for over two years. It was ok for the most part. I really didn't get along with the manager too well is why I don't have my job now. My coworkers were great people.
bad,I hate I wasted time filling out an application for this place. The former store manager was lazy and the current one doesn't seem any better. The store is always in a mess and unstocked.
bad,"Poor Pay, poor treatment of employees. There were usually 2 people or less working in the store. Even though I worked in one of the highest grossing stores in my county it was nasty and they dont care about their employees.."
bad,"If you are not a manager you will not get full time hours. If you do not want to be a manager, you will not get full time hours. Cashiers do not get full time hours"
bad,they are gonna work you long hrs. if you are a manager in low income area..... good luck. pay doesnt meet the workmload by far so they give salary with bonus. not bad bugt not great at all
bad,while working at dollar general I did not get paid enough nor did I receive enough hours to have a steady paycheck as a full time assistant manager...
bad,"Typical day at work required stocking, running the cash register, printing out plans of prices to be put out on the floor. checking counts for orders that were shipped in, and taking care of customers. I learned management skills by taking quizzes from lesson videos to receive certificates stating a passing grade for placement. Dollar General is a great place to learn how to manage a store. The hardest part about the job was the overall drama in the workplace. The most enjoyable part about the job was the customers and getting to know them."
bad,Corporate officials expect stores to maintain productivity while only having a skeleton crew staff. Always lack of associates per shift. Not enough payroll scheduling hours provided to properly staff storr
bad,"Depending on which store you work at, it could be a great and wonderful job. some of the dollar generals have management who actually care about employees while other the management will only give you 10 or less hours a week"
bad,Store manager got sick and released from job. Other employers were either fired or quite. Upper management had no back up plan. Left store up in the air. And never had good communication with her. She could never get anyone to replace employees lost. And dropped everything in my laps.
bad,i like the job it was the  best job i had dat had good  pay good hour ac help wen u need some one wen u cant dosome think u ask for help i had good time work for tim
bad,"Helpful in health management and fun to spend time with kids.It has help me economise thin for future use.Many interaction to people was helpful on the other way round,in that they can entertain you mostly."
bad,lack of letting you do your job but yet act like its your fault when things are not done lack of employees makes for harder days on getting things stocked on shelves for customers to buy lack of pay but work you to death
bad,"The customers were rude, the manager made me feel like i wasn't even allowed to use the bathroom when i needed. They never schedualed me for more than 13 hours a week."
bad,corporate is unaware of the employees needs and wants. the company is only worried about the bottom line no matter the cost to employees or customers.
bad,I will say that it was definitely hard working at Dollar General. Not because of the customer's but because of the management and they were completely understaffed. I will also say that the store I worked at should have been shut down because of the dirt and filth in the store. They had old product on the shelf's and the shelf's were completely filled with dust and dried product. The back room was filled beyond capacity and made its way to the sales floor. It was so bad customers couldn't even shop freely. No matter how much you put up their was always product coming in and not enough employees to get everything cleared. It was so unstructured and not a place I would recommend anyone to go and work at.
bad,"I started with this company as a pt employee, through people quitting I was advanced to ft position. This si the only way you can be advanced. Once you reach ft status you are eligible for insurance but be prepared for your hours to be cut so then all your doing is paying for the insurance on pt hours. Horrible place to work"
bad,I left due to the fact a MANAGER felt the needed to put herself into my life with my family matters and make it a joke. It was rude and unprofessional.
bad,I am currently looking to sue this company for discrimination. They don't care about the staff only the store manager's and the District manager's....
bad,I do not recommend Dollar general to anyone. If you are not the type to have your nose up your bosses butt. You will not getting treated fairly at all. It has been three weeks and I am still waiting on my transfer.
bad,"Stocking shelves, operating a register, performing minimal cleaning duties, and greeting customers were everyday tasks. The management was outstanding and the employees were fun to work with."
bad,"The environment was okay"
bad,the employers didnt show me how to work eveything like i felt they should and this company only worked me for two days and they owe me for one and when i try to get they me get me my mony i was told that the wait tiem was to long on the phone to hr
bad,I didnt like the managers judging me n stuff. I has bad influence working some of the them. they where lazy no doing there job. They would talk behind people back.
bad,"No set hours, ever. You had to call in the night before after 8 pm to find out if you worked the next day. Which is fine for someone that has nothing else to do, but if you've got kids or another job, this isn't the place for you."
bad,Acquired a store that had a lot of shop lifting . They would not give any hours to have employees working . I had to work from opening to close a lot. The whole time I was there I had 2 days off.
bad,"Dollar General is not a good place to work, at lease not the DC. The place is a bad spot to work, you get worked like a dog and the pay isnt good and they use more then anything"
bad,My experience wasnt very good with them. Understaffed forcing other staff members to extend their work hours. Lazy staff and Managers. The stores arent usually cleaned very well.
bad,"Your not valued for your work. Disrespected, unappreciated and just an all out bad environment. The company doesn't care about It's employees and the management is worse. No raises or benefits either. Plus they will cut all your hours to give them to the new employees so they can save 50 cent an hour.  The company expects you to do work that they don't want to pay you for. I was In a management position and there were several times that I had to work off the clock.  And by the way, no employee discount either. Don't waste your time."
bad,"don't work here ever if you can help it. "
bad,"The manager was very rude, threw his hand up at me in front of customers AND my own mother because I told him I needed a specific day off to take my daughter to the doctor AND I told him a month before the appointment. He doesn't treat anyone right. He's rude to Customer. too much drama !"
bad,Dollar General is my least favorite job I've ever had and I wouldn't reccomend this job to anyone unless that person had some strange desire to get treated poorly and work twice as hard as everyone around you but not move up the food chain because you're young.
bad,Dollar General is the most unorganized place i have ever worked for. I  would not recemmend anyone working or shopping there. The store is always in a mess.
bad,My manger tried to start a romantic relationship with me . He offered me 10000 to have his child. I don't recommend this job to anyone . It's useless .
bad,This job was the worst job that I ever had. The manager had no idea what she was doing. Whenever there would be a problem with a customer she would always call the police.
bad,Dollar General used to be a great place to work when i first started. Now the company gives you a staff of 6-10 and no hours to give these employees. as a salaried manager it is your job to make sure all assigned projects are done in the time given.
bad,"There management and lack of communication is extremely poor, they do not pay enough for what you are expected to do and they have too high of expectations when it comes to the work they want you to get done in a certain time frame. It is a very poor company to work for and I would not recommend it to anyone"
bad,Great pay if you are a store manager. Long stressful days.district managers don't stand behind you. Never can keep help expect to much out of cashiers for little pay.
bad,The manager is terrible. She has no idea how to run a store that well and she is very rude and hateful. I don't suggest for anyone to apply to the Dollar General in Reidsville unless you like being worked to death.
bad,"They expect way too much from you. The pay sounds nice but once you figure your numbers( days there,work expected) you made less than min wage in my book. Plus there was no gratitude or satisfaction for what you did do."
bad,One of the most stressful places that I have ever worked in my entire life!  I would never recommend to a friend or relative to apply for a job with this company.
bad,Never work here. People are horrible. Boss people are lazy and rude. Pay is nothing and will work you down to nothing. Constant degrading of emplyoees
bad,"dollar general is a terrible company to work for. long hours, low pay, and they dont allow enough hours to complete the workloads. all about squeezing people dry"
bad,I worked for only two months I was hired because they needed workers and someone with customer service was a plus. I was told everything I knew about customer service is wrong and not to use them and all that matter was stocking shelves and cashing the customer out as quick as possible.
bad,The manager was unfair and discrimitory. Only scheduled to work on weekends and nights. Had an opportunity to work with other managers who did not treat employees and the home manager did.
bad,Would not seek employment with company again.  There is a culture of distrust from corporate and there is no support from upper management.  The pay is lousy as well.
bad,"This place has horrid management."
bad,"When working for dollar general we never had enough help and when you actually got off at your time to go home your replacement was always late or didn't come in at all,  I don't know if all locations were like this or if was just the one I worked at.  I think if we had reliable workers it would have been a lot better to work for."
bad,I'm not sure how dollar general treats it employees these days but I know for sure that when I worked there our daily task felt more akin to slave labor. It wasn't an ideal workplace although I did grow exponentially due to that exposure.
bad,Most jobs I work there is no such thing as too much work. Dollar general however was way to much work. There were so many boxes and loads that we barely got anything other than that done and my manager was so aggressive towards us employees.
bad,"Place is non-work/life balanced. Employees do not work like they are expected to. Customers are great, but only positive thing. Within 3 months, store was robbed, an employee was arrested due to theft."
bad,07.25 an hour while you do everything other than the till. work 25 hours a week and only get 120. No wonder they are always hiring. If they up the pay they could keep people
bad,"Very tedious surveys do not tickle my fancy. Very time consuming and silly to have mandatory surveys for jobs. If I wanted to rate them, I would have done so prior to leaving my job."
bad,It was the worse place I have ever worked I wound not recommend this job to anyone you are over worked and not paid enough.  There is no organization to the job and most people could care less if they was there or not.
bad,This is without a doubt the worst place I have ever worked. Horrible customer service. Management treats employees like their worthless. Nothing but drama all the time. Place needs to close down or clean house!
bad,Worst place to work they do not respect their workers. Very hard labor for the amount of pay you receive. I don't recommend it to anyone. I worked here and left with back problems.
bad,Other employees were NOT reliable. Went 2 and a half weeks without a day off because of other employees calling off or just not showing up. LOTS OF DRAMA.
bad,I had a very uncomfortable experience with an assistant manager where he violated the harassment rules! I was too scared to come out about the experience but my respect for the employees lowered.
bad,"Low pay, tedious, no advancement to high paying position. Don't have a chance to learn important skills to carry over to a successful company. Do get to learn basics of retail and bussiness."
bad,"The manager was never helpful. They never gave anyone good hours, maybe 12 a week if you were lucky. in other words they don't care about there employees."
bad,"When I first started working for Dollar General I loved the company and even considered continuing my career with them after I graduated, but in the 5yrs I worked for them I noticed changes in the company that changed my perspective on them as a company I would continue working for."
bad,"Too demanding for what they pay you. My schedule was given to me almost with no notice, 1-3 days before I had to work. No flexibility. Micro management is a big problem. Too much is expected. My second job was not a concern to them. Even part time workers couldn't have a second job considering the schedule was put out a day or two before you had to work that schedule. Was asked to come off break & ring customers out & break later which is illegal but they don't care. No hours, luckily I was full time & only needed 30 hours which they had to give me. Wouldn't recommend anyone working there unless you just got out of jail & need to get on your feet"
bad,"Very fast paced environment"
bad,This place has no regard for employees. Completely understaffed and had favorites who were allowed to do whatever they wanted. Hired almost nobody with reliable transportation leaving those with it to do the worst hours. Managers are so concerned with themselves and each other they treat employees awfully. I was once made to work while sick and got called to check where I was 5 minutes before my shift ever even started. I would not recommend this place to anyway. One cashier only all the time and they expect you to run truck and organize everything while also never having a customer in line for more than 2 seconds. When they jump on register it's always after you've been consistently for an hour checking out customers. I often didn't even get my lunch break or was short changed because a manger wanted to leave early.
bad,"I love fast pace, multiple tasks and wonderful people. This company gives employees an over abundance of tasks to do and not enough time to do it in."
bad,While working at Dollar General i had a good experience over all. In regards to the management at the time had the worst people skills. I would have expecte better from a Store manager with experience
bad,"It is a okay place to work, if you like flexible hours and ect. I don't like flexible hour because I have kids. By time I made it home from work my kids was in the bed sleep."
bad,The company itself is not organized with their employees. The work was not hard. If I opened I had to count down the register and straighted up around the registers. If I closed I had to close out the register and clean the whole store while the manager or third key did paperwork. Then we would lock up.
bad,"I liked it, i suppose i hated the far commute i couldnt afford the drive so i had to quit working there i liked it for the most part it was a good place to work"
bad,"If you enjoy living life, spending time with your family or enjoying your alone time, then this is not the place for you! Run in the opposite direction and don't look back!!"
bad,"For minimum wage you are expected to  stock and tidy up the entire grocery section, stock cigarettes, stock sodas in the cooler, remove items from the sidewalk and bring them back into the store, sweep, mop, clean up any spills in the grocery section, stock all items near the register. You are supposed to accomplish these things while having to stop and help the customers at the register. You do this all by yourself while the ""keyholder"" works in the back of the store."
bad,"I worked here while i was pregnant. The employer forced me to unload boxes, reach high shelves and i was not allowed to sit for more than five minutes. I went home with extremely swollen feet, and actually pulled a uterine muscle. My doctor had to write him a note to not work me more than 6 hour shifts, or i had to be put on bed rest. He then cut off all my hours and basically bullied me into quitting."
bad,People do not want to be there to work.  Most of the employees are very negative about their jobs.  High stressful environment.  No benefits and not enough hours given to the store to schedule enough people to run it.
bad,Dollar General is more concerned with building new stores and not keeping up the old ones. Cashiers take a lot of slack from customers because of their policies.
bad,Dollar General was a good company to work for. The management was good. A typical day was running the cash register and stocking the shelves. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customer got the right change back.
bad,A typical day at work would be me assisting customers on the cash register while maintaining a clean environment for customers to shop. I learned that each customer was different. The management was a bit lazy but did not effect my job ethics. The most enjoyable part if the job  was talking to regular customerss
bad,"Honestly, Dollar General is the worst company I have ever worked for. Pay was awful ! Store manager was horrible, hours were horrible.. and they messed up all of my checks it was like pulling teeth for them the get my pay checks correct ! On some paydays I never got my check.. I encourage people to NEVER appy !"
bad,"I don't agree with a lot of things I have encountered at this place. My district manager, has his favorites and if you're not on that list he will find a way to push you out. My manager is childish and likes to constantly keep drama going around. It's a very poisonous work place.. mentally anyways."
bad,"manager was horrible, that's why i left. i needed to go to appointments for my child and they weren't flexible at all. i had to leave"
bad,this company is horrible. you would think that working for them for 5 years you would feel like part of a team BUT YOU DONT. the management is so childish and unprofessional. they treat their employees like we are just garbage and the pay is low for as much as they expect you to do.
bad,Was a job that did not allow me to learn activities in a timely manner. It was a bad work experience. The crew was rude and customers were to.
bad,"i did get pleanty of hours but customers, work conditions/ expectations were terrible. management was highly stressed and rude."
bad,"nobody does there job there ,the bosses are never in, no good training,11 hours maximum,very rude customer service advise to look away"
bad,If you are looking for a job keep looking it is just now worth your time. There is no training.  They tell you that your hours will be between 30 and 20 hours a week but it will be less.  I worked for them for 3 weeks and my hours were cut each week.  I worked as a cashier with no help.  Customers lining up and getting angry at me for having to wait in line.  When I quit the threatened me with being put on a  non hire list for 3000 companies if I didn't give them a 2 weeks notice.   My state is a right to work state which means that they can fire me for no reason and I can quit without notice.  You would think as much money as they make if they would have more help and better customer service.  After all the customers are the bread and butter of retail.
bad,"Will never go back to this place. It is very unprofessional, just plain bad all the way around. Rude, dirty, bugs all over the store, SM is lazy and won't clean."
bad,loved the job and people but the pay was not enough to get by as a single mother that has no help. also never got enough hours through the week
bad,"she  had something against my manager but not against me. my manager made some mistakes and  the whole crew was let go one by one right after chritmas but i was a keyholder and i used to open and close the store the majority if the week,"
bad,"As many times as I've applied online, you think they could atleast send me an email telling me they aren't hiring in Hastings, NE! I'm more than qualified to work there! Guess that's what you get when you let a computer pick your employees! No such thing as the perfect employee!! Wonder who the idiots were who came up with that concept??"
bad,"not fair very streefull,long hours loved my co workers. i did learn alot while with them but they do not care about there people pay low for what they wanted"
bad,"It might have just been the store i worked at and the manager i worked with, but working for them was a nightmare. not to mention the store was in such a horrible location."
bad,"worst company to work,  very high shrink, upper management with out a clue on how to control.  will not listen to feedback..no suport"
bad,"A typical day would be to clean, stock, and provide for customers. The co-workers were friendly and well-skilled. The hardest part of the job was being able to deal with customers whom reacted out of anger. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I helped a customer(s) to find what it was that they were looking for."
bad,"The rate is impossible, and they do not care about employees. While I was there I saw literally hundreds of people come and go. Avoid at all costs"
bad,great experience here any other questions don't mind answering any .And help wit me learning more skills and advancing the ones I have. very good work environment
bad,"management was very poor and they were always playing favorites among higher management.very unprofessional about meetings, store presentation, and overall professionalism."
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be doing POG's, recovering, and doing deposits at the end of the day."
bad,"You have to run the cash register as well as stock. You are unable to perform either task very well, due to the lack of help.  I honestly do not know how they remain open."
bad,"Counting registers, assisting customers, running register if needed, stocking, cleaning, deposit, closing store and other duties as needed."
bad,"Cons: you end up alone"
bad,"All managers are liars, from interview point on. ""Corp"" district manager are just as bad."
bad,Started out great and then just went down hill. They will fire you for something they haven't trained you on.
bad,I learn how to deal with various type of people and how to mul-titask on a daily basis.
bad,"Dollar general was a complete waste of my time, It may have improved since i left over a year and 3 months ago. When i worked for Dg, It had the worst managerial issues ive ever seen, No one could get there facts together and work right it was a disaster. I would not recommend anyone working here!!"
bad,"If you have another choice take it, She fired me because I had to take off to go to a funeral"
bad,"The working enviroment was terrible at this store, its the only reason I'm still not employed there. Also because seeking a job in the field i went to school in."
bad,The manager was very hard on her co workers. It was a very difficult place to work for.
bad,The place is discusting and has a horrible odor! No one is friendly and the workers are all young rude teens.
bad,kept scheduling me on days that I had to go to school so was forced to leave
bad,I did not enjoy my time here and was poorly treated.  Not bad for everyone but was not the right place for me.
bad,They do not care about their employees at all!! Unfair company to work for.
bad,Assisted with guest transactions.  Drove sales by educating guests on current sales and offers.
bad,"I spent more time as a cashier than I had to do the task assigned."
bad,"The store was located in a scary part of town. Overall, it was a generally nice environment."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General for me was first and foremost clocking in.  Then I proceed to count my drawer for my register to make sure I'm starting off with $100 each day. From there on out I am greeting people when they walk through the door, assisting people with questions and concerns and checking them out. The day went by slow if customers weren't coming in and shopping as much.  My co-workers and I got along well, we would talk and make each other laugh to pass on time.  The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude customers.  If something rings up the wrong price they want to curse you out, they want to speak to your manager, and if they feel you are getting a little upset they then want the number to corporate. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers as well.  I enjoyed having a small chats with them as I checked them out. Whether it was encouraging them to do something or sharing my experiences with them about certain things or just smiling and enjoying the positvity from different people."
bad,"Helping customers find the item they are looking for, checking out their items, setting planograms when you are not checking out a customer, completing the assigned task before your shift ends."
bad,"A TYPICAL DAY AT PIOLT WAS EASY GOING, I Have had the most great manager experince. the hadrest thing is couldn't work like i wanted to. its boost my management experince."
bad,It's not a bad job to have but the company expects your life to completely revolve around and stop for this job. 
bad,This is the worst company to work for. They do not care about their employee's. You can't have another job while employed with them or go to school. You also can't have kids because if you do and they get sick or even if you get sick you will be fired on the spot. This company has a lot of issues. The pay is not appropriate for the job and if you are employed full-time you still only get part-time hours. 
bad,it is not the greatest place to work the people there are very rude
bad,"employees are not treated with respect, they dont provide a steady schedule and are not a good place to work. you may not get paid in a timely manner as i had to wait 5 months to be paid for a shift i worked and 2 months on a seperate shift, of wich both required several communications with the corperate office to get results."
bad,"This job was my least favorite. I liked the co-workers but they all had their ways. I learned how to talk to people and actually be friendly. I've also learned how to get along with others even when they got on your bad side. The co-workers were really fun to be around. The hardest part was unloading the cart before you left for the day. At times, it was more than one. I enjoyed being around my peers and relating to them"
bad,"Working as a cashier was a frustrating task. The cashiers were only required to do a certain amount of voids, yet there was no control over the amount of voids that was being given. The cashier would get written up if the amount of voids were greater than the amount of voids required."
bad,"Run as fast as you can. The pay was bad, no training,and DM is no help. Work with no lunches, working 12 hour shifts, store managers from other stores spying on different stores"
bad,was trying to go to school and and they wouldnt work with my schedual
bad,It was ok but other employees were rude got to see family and friends shop at the store help customers
bad,really didnt do anything most the time people stood around.
bad,"Dollar General was a pretty okay place to work, but there was a lack of good management."
bad,"It was productive, and okay to work there. Manager needed to be there more often."
bad,Overall good company to work for. Home office was helpful. Good at answering questions. The pay is not the best but better than most. Regional Manager not a people person always negative never a good thing to say about anyone. Would always find something wrong. I did enjoy my job the customers are great. Always dreadful when regional manager was coming around for everyone.
bad,This place does not stand behind its employees even though I had good times working as an assistant manager and working with the people in the initial store it was too much to have to deal with the corporate office that had no clue about the peoples needs in the small rural area we live in. They didnt care about it all.
bad,"When your working at Dollar General just be very careful! Get your money in time, do not do any work outside of you clocking out. Get your check on time! If it’s your first week always make sure your in the system"
bad,"It was ok working for Dollar General. The pay was ok, but didn't feel like I was getting paid enough for doing what I was doing. Management had their moments on doing things right and wrong."
bad,Dollar General seemed like a decent workplace up until I noticed lack of employees.One employee would run the register and do multiple other tasks at once while the other employee just stocked shelves/recovered merchandise.Schedule was very inconsistent and very inconvenient considering I have a child and was asked what my working preferences were when I was hired.
bad,I loved managing my team and most of my district managers. But Dollar General puts too much on Store Managers and doesn't provide the payroll or tools for them to succeed. Some weeks I worked 60 to 80 hours just to complete tasks that were mandatory. During inventory I worked almost 20 hours in one day and returned the next morning and did it over again.
bad,This place of employment could be good for others but it was not for me. They would rather get rid of you than to work with you on your issues. The company as a whole is focused on money and nothing else.
bad,Working at Dollar General was terrible pay for the hours and work I put in. The only good thing was my coworkers. They were great and a good reason to keep me there.
bad,"I really enjoyed working for this company ,and I got fired I was doing really well becoming a lead sales associate so quickly I was looking forward to staying with the company I thought it was going well but my boss was something else and the GM was down with it"
bad,"overall a good company that has lot its way with work life balance, min of 6 days per week. but they do a lot of things right."
bad,I like work in a warehouse and its very manager and I have fun work in a warehouse but I also want to work as assistant and I love working as a team player. The hardest part of the job is to learned everything but I am a quick learner so its really not that hard the most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work to see new think and experience new thing what we need to meet for the daily quotas.
bad,people keep braking in to lockers and stilling peoples things
bad,They don't really care about your family or home life at all. They just want you to work and that's it with very little pay and weird hours. No time for any of the online courses you have to take
bad,"I do not mean to be rude, but the job was difficult with rude customers and majority of my coworkers did not like their job either. The job was very stressful overall and not recommended by its customers either."
bad,"They pay extremely well for managers but your employees make minimum wage and only get 20 to 25 hours a week. The hours for labor provided to the store is not nearly enough. A lot of the time people are alone for several hours.  If someone calls out or quits you only have a few people to choose from to cover their shift. 9 times out of 10 its you who has to cover the shift or end up alone all day. On salaried pay. If you fall behind work wise because of said call out you are screwed. There are no extra hours provided if you get behind. The truck is expected to be done in two days by two people. One of the people working the truck is back up register so have fun with that.  Also it seems you get all of your vendors on truck days too. So that makes it harder to complete the truck. Was told by my district manager when i told him that i had outs because people kept calling out or quitting i was told i was putting myself into the ""victim bucket"" When i left i was working almost 80 hours a week. That company does not care about their people at all."
bad,They don't have a lot of payroll per store and most of the work falls on store manager so you have to work a lot of hours to get things done don't have a lot of payroll to train others
bad,Too much physical labor for only $7.75 per hour. They need to start their employees off at $8.00 per hour or $8.50 an hour to make it worthwhile. Overworked and underpaid.
bad,Dollar General is a great place to work it's just some of the areas that we have to work in deal with a lot of shrinkage a lot of theft from none customers these non-customers threatened and sometimes get physical with the employees as well as management there's no physical security there you can tell these individuals not to return to the store but the company provides no way of keeping them out which keeps you subject to the constant torment why you trying to do your job
bad,"The manager would always be rude to customers and treat works unfairly. She would say I need more training bet never provided it, just gave me 6 hours a week."
bad,I believe that a lot of the managers see favorites and treat people differently. They are only ok with people when they work hard but one thing messes up they aren't any good anymore. I loved my job because I love retail work but just don't see it fair.
bad,"Must be an absolute workhorse to get the job done with minimal payroll. To keep the bosses off your tail, you gotta have your priorities in line with the company’s latest focus, which changes from week-to-week. Every single thing in the store falls on the manager’s shoulders. 10,000+ items in one building, absolutely impossible to manage perfectly. 🤷‍♂️"
bad,I worked in repack and I hated. It’s too physical and the production is unrealistic. And it’s hot. Too much walking too much pressure.  The training sucked. Just hated the whole thing.  Don’t go there
bad,"restocking the store was fast, lifting heavy boxes all day. helping people who could not find what they needed. great people to work with. store was close to home."
bad,"Spent most of my time within the warehouse. I worked seven days out of a week, any where from 12-19 hour shifts. There were short 15 minute breaks every three hours and not a very friendly environment to work in."
bad,"would not recommend this company, they let things go on when advice of wrong doing.I worked extremely hard everyday. My job was very serious and I was awarded well within short time worked. I started as a cashier then moved to part time key holder/lead. Then went to full time Lead, then to Assistant Manager."
bad,I disliked the dollar General I was employed at I must admit that the manger did give me as many hours as i liked an i did enjoy meeting the many different customers but I didn't enoy some of the people I worked with
bad,The dollar general I worked for was awful. My manager was very rude and spent more time smoking then working. I wasn't properly trained on a lot of things.
bad,"Greeting costumer"
bad,"Stocked"
bad,A managers typical day would be to open the store and allow the vendors to unload the trucks and products.  There are daily reports that have to be ran and multiple bank runs and register change outs.  On occassion you may have few problems to resolve but overall this job is very simple.
bad,Under no circumstances would I ever recommend anyone working for Dollar General! The upper level manager for the Henniker location is an undermining pig who gets off on making his own employees feel like “dirt”(this isn’t even close to the word I wanted to use!) for doing their job. RUN!! Don’t even bother filling out the application!
bad,"My time at Dollar General was overall a poor, unforgiving, and messy experience. From contending with mean and often times hateful management to a constantly mismanaged store and low pay, my experience was horrible. Do not work for this company."
bad,They don’t want to pay enough. You work so much harder than the assistant manager and they still won’t give you a raise or even acknowledge your efforts. They also do not let you have time to spend with your family. I’m a single parent and I do not get to spend time with my child I’m expected to work more than the boss does.
bad,Just not a very good job they put a lot on to one person and expect you to finish all of the work they assigned! They never scedual more then two people at once and most times it’s only one person for 4-5 hours at a time
bad,Unfortunately District Managers do absolutely nothing to help their General Managers and are never available. Internal theft is a big obstacle in this company starting from upper management. If you are a threat in any way to unmasking their ordeal then you are terminated unfairly. Loss prevention is also part of this unfairness.
bad,"I enjoy seeing customers smile but at what cost I am constantly told I don’t do my shift tasks but when asking a shift manager all tasks are said to be done just fine. It has come to find that if previous associates tasks aren’t done to par rather than assigning blame or written up it is put on myself to pick up this slack in the form of telling my work is not done to par by the manager, instead confronting others of their poor work"
bad,i dont recommend anyone to work there worst experince of my life managment was the worst the way they treated there employees and didnt pay them what the deserved
bad,They will let you go for calling out even if you call out in time to get someone to cover you shift they are not good ppl to work for the managers gossip Barbour the sale associates and they write you up for their mistakes my experience working for them was horrible I can’t believe I spend 11 months there
bad,"Poor management, and reading skills, very messy, and not proper maintain and shelf's of merchandise was always rerranged  bad. Garbage piled up in stock room , and not proper training on cashier check out."
bad,The manager of the place i worked at did not treat the staff as equals and had favorites. I do not recommend working there ever. If you do choose to work here I would advise that you work hard no matter the circumstance.
bad,"Manager would hire children that she knew as keyholders that had NO experience with opening or closing a store. "
bad,"I worked at DG for 4 years & loved the 1st 3, when I was promoted to store manager & moved to the worst store in the district not so much. It’s high expectations & low resources. While working 60+ hours a week for the same sorry paycheck. If that’s what you’re missing in your life then this is the job for you."
bad,Not a good place to work if you have family. Job takes you away from being with family. Not flexible on giving you days off when you put in notice at expected time
bad,"Vacation hours were stolen from me and when it was brought up to manager she said, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of you."" Her version of taking care of her employees was trying to throw them under the bus every chance she got. It was always to save her own behind too. Things she never had us do, like recover every night, were shirked as her employees didn't listen to her supervisors (DM, RM, CEO, Etc)."
bad,"I enjoyed working with my Mabelvale store but the Pecos store was a disaster. The manager was racist and uncooperative for a family life. She hired employees who would not listen to ""white"" women and never corrected their behavior."
bad,I was pregnant and i had doctor notes to he able to eat and drink and not to lift. They would not take them so i quite the next day i went into preterm labor.
bad,The experience was overall good but not great. It could have been better. Management is extremely helpful and friendly and always good service but working there next to being a customer are two totally different cases
bad,"Hard job very stressful no time off for family just hard work. Managers are very unprofessional they don't treat everyone fair.need more than two working a shift for all they demand of their employees"
bad,dont give you hours.when you need a managers help the oe manager would tell me to figure it the f out she wasnt helping in front of costumers.So i couldnt do my job so ispped working for them because why work for a place if you cant get the help when you need it and no one wants to work.I work to work not just stand around and be paid for it.
bad,Horrible place to work. No benefits for discounts. Pay is very poor for the amount of work you do. Management does not care and will not back you up on anything.
bad,Take this job if its the only thing available and you are out of options. It was always chaotic and unorganized. Pay wasn’t that great nor are the hours. You literally have to fight to get 40hr unless in management.
bad,They overlook unprofessional behavior by store managers. No accountability for poor performance by store managers. Low wages for hourly employees.  Poor training.
bad,Laid off and blocked without being told about anything. They don’t give you any warnings or anything... Poor management as well and slow workers. Don’t work here.
bad,"Started nice, but then very quickly became stressful. Manager refused to hire someone even when we were 2 people short, so I ended up working for about 3 months straight. Ended when some customers started spreading rumors and the manager decided to call me screaming and yelling. So I quit on the spot"
bad,"The pay is horrible, the management sucks and hours suck. Company doesn't really care for employees. Can be stressful of working in a highly populated area die to theft."
bad,"Pay is horrible, they always cut hours, slow-quick advancement, lots of turn overs, always have to prove yourself to the next person, stressful, dangerous at times, unless you get with a good staff you wont be willing to tough things out. Since 70% of DG staff apparently steals nationwide you are also watched as a potential thief. They write you up for small mistakes or even get fired on the first mistake. Usually over cash shortages."
bad,"at times I enjoyed my job I tried to go back to it but was blackballed had a great interview in Memphis bit either the Market Manager or his Boss gave me a bad review I was out 9-10 months had a store inventory while I was out on Medical it came up 120000.short now my first inventory was under 40,000 but I was there the whole year as for the blow out Nothing was ever done with my employees that was giving everything away just don't understand how they can hold that Inventory against me while I wasn't there but 3 months top"
bad,"This job was too much responsibility for the amount of pay offered.  As an assistant store manager,  I barely broke 10$ an hour. "
bad,"One week you get good hours, the next week your hours get cut, no room for advancement even though they tell you there is. "
bad,job was stressful. pay not good for this job. customers were not friendly. Management didn't know how to make proper schedule for work days. couldn't keep employees due to pay
bad,I was sexually harassed and when I said something to the customer who did it I was told not to speak to her customers that way and nothing was done about having a man try to shove his hand down the back of my pants
bad,"was not allowed to take time off for doc appts. Store Manager was not very put together ,the store was a mess when i got their ,i started to clean store up and she didn't like it . met some of the best customers their and still speak and talk to them"
bad,Its alright. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has a family. About the only good thing about dollar general is the people you met. Some of the customers are amazing
bad,"The store manager was very petty and negative. She made everyone miserable to the point they quit. She fired me because "" she didn't like me"". Then made it so I could never work there again. She did that to everyone she fired or who quit."
bad,This was a very unorganized place. The store manager was more worried about being a friend to the team and I was more focused on getting the store where it needed to be.
bad,It is ok although the pay is very low and your superiors talk to you like you are nothing very disrespectful and there is no work life balance I do not suggest it to antone
bad,"I enjoyed working for this for the year I was able to work.  But they don't give u enough hours a week if you are a cashier u don't get many hours . U can become a key holder , assistant manager etc"
bad,DG does not care if you are a manager and work 90 hours a week when you only get paid for 40. The DM's don't care about their employees they only care if something is going to affect their bonus!
bad,"A company that does not have a care in the world for their employees. Pay is awful, management is awful, & they probably have one of the highest turn over rates than any company. If you work here, you will more than likely feel defeated every day, even on your days off, because you will work yourself as hard as you can and not hear a single word about it because YOU DO NOT MATTER. This company sees every employee as being REPLACABLE. You will not 100% enjoy your days off because you will sit around dreading the next day you have to go back to that place. Dollar General loves to keep pathetic, useless managers who do NOTHING and lose their hard working dependable employees who get tired of dealing with the bull! Do not work for this company if you want to be happy and have a life. If you do work for this company, make sure you’re single and have no children. I see my husband maybe 5 hours a week if I am lucky! They do not care about you. Or me."
bad,I dont get paid enough there to even afford a home for me an my family. I am a hard worker and I do my absolute best . But my family comes first and I need a job to where I can support my family properly and I cant do it there.
bad,"Dollar General is a very stressful workplace. You don’t get any benefits worth having, No discounts and the management is very unprofessional. I worked there for over a year and never once got a chance to get a better position."
bad,"I hope that if you do get a job at a Dollar General that is a boring experience, with Dollar General thats the most you can hope for. The worst that can happen is you get a Slave Driver boss that will put you on near every night shift and every weekend. God help you if you need 2 days out of the week for classes...at night."
bad,The management is very sloppy and messy. They didnt want to pay employees above minimum wage. They required you work passed your amount off hours. They put alot pin your plate and don't provide the hours to perform there high expectations. Something different everyday. Overall company needs to get a tighter grip on the people they have in management
bad,"I'm not saying that Dollar General is generally a bad job. Just don't work at the one in Saint Matthews, SC 29135. It is not a great work environment. The team is slack, and service really sucks."
bad,Working here I started off doing rather easy work and I tried to push to learn more and more to in hopes get a full time position I was promised and never got
bad,"Our store is a high traffic store, which means we always have customers. All the times I've been working it was just me working the cash register. The most employees I've seen at that store has been 3, which includes the manager; so yeah we're severely understaffed and yet I can hardly get any hours so i don't know what's up with this store..."
bad,"The company expects A LOT from you while offering little to nothing in return. Corporate managers were the rudest, nastiest people I’ve ever met in my life. Hours were nonexistent. Many shifts of working in the store by yourself, which meant ringing customers while also trying to get shelves stocked (never happened). The store was always way too busy, the cashier was never able to leave the register for more than a minute or two tops. District manager and loss prevention always in store harrassing us. Store itself was dirty and trashy. Impossible to stick shelves. All the stock piled up in back or on carts throughout the store, with bare shelves. Way too much clutter without the time or manpower to do anything about it. Customers were awful, made a mess of the place and stole a lot."
bad,"They expect much more than you're capable of doing while working the cash register. Management is not involved with their employees. Like my manager told me, employees are easy come easy go. Some days were ok and enjoyable. My best days was getting to work with the assistant manager. She was awesome."
bad,no security. rude customers poor corporate system. Sometimes it feels like they don't like care about you or your family. The wages are not good enough for you to live on.
bad,"You do have a lot to do on your shift.Some don't  do as much as they should. I have seen a lot lots of changes from First owner to the next. District manager used to come in the store  call you by name Shake Your Hand. Now they just come in and don't speak to you. They are no better than anybody else. We have a store meeting one time. District manager says everybody could be replaced even him. He has been replaced repeatedly repeatedly over my time being at Dollar General. Benefits,paid vacation it's been taken away. It's a job.Its will help you get by that's it. Don't expect a lot of pay!!!"
bad,"I was hired on off the bat as an assistant manager with 5 years retail experience. They would not budge from their pay of 10.10. I did not see a raise in the year I was there. Even after doing a stint of 4 months acting as manager and assistant manager with a short staffed store. No help from the RM or GM and had no access to hire new associates. I spent 70 hours a week there keeping the store afloat only for them to hire outside for the manager position. Their choice of manager was in poor taste and they did not do a darn thing. The company and hows its run left a bad taste in my mouth for sure. No food benefits and low pay, especially for a company that make approximately 1.5 million dollars per store."
bad,unfortunately the manager had no management experience and this was a new store opening. Only working  two months and talking to the District manager about the situation nothing was done to fix the issue and both assistant managers left. Stressful environment to work in. Working freight is fast paced. Helping customers is rewarding. Hardest part of the job is putting out freight and trying to keep on eye on the registers. I would not recommend the job to friends
bad,"Chaotic, dramatic filled store. Horrible place to work if you don't take stress well. Customers complain, other employees are lazy but overworked and warehouse sends way over the volume that the store needs. The expectations are unreasonable."
bad,It's a job and I will go back. It's not my first option but it is a nice place depending upon who your district manager is.They need to keep more help. And they need better security in these stores and around them
bad,"My first day I was assigned to run the cash register with minimal training. If I had a problem I was to yell for one of the managers. This is not professional."
bad,I feel like i was fired on extremely ridiculous terms. They need to get a dm that has actually worked for the dollar general company BEFORE they try to manage an entire district.
bad,"High rate of turnover, be prepared to work front and back of store, lack of leadership.  Great first time job or if you are going to school.  If you find a store with a great manager and a good team then it is not a bad place to work."
bad,"My store has 3 or more people on day shift and 2 on at night and the location of the store is busy at night. They needed more than two people at all times.The cashier often had to juggle 3 tasks and run the register. The MOD/ Lead Cashier was often lazy and pushed the work on the other co-worker. They can't keep part-time workers because of the behavior of the MODs and the manager that only hires because of desperation. The dynamic in the store, as a new person, is segregated and I'd been there for over 6 months and still felt like an outsider. There is no trust in the company. The part-time workers were the only ones that received bag checks at the end of the shift. The MOD will go through my bag without my permission throughout the shift and constantly check on me in the break room on my breaks for no apparent reason."
bad,"To work in a place like Dollar General, you have to have good customer service skills, a fast paced work ethic, and be a really hard worker. If you’re a key holder or a manger you have to be free any time there is a call in because it is your responsibility to fill in that persons time. You also have to work well with others and be friendly and helpful."
bad,One of the worst places I've had to work changeover with management and assistant management happened almost every two months hours were never the same always cut starting pay 725 an hour 25 cent raise after a year no room to advance or make any type of good money store no room for advancement the pay was awful the people were not so nice everyone stressed out store was always unbalanced lots of inner struggle with coworkers
bad,"I believe store managers should clock in and prove times they have actually worked. "
bad,Was a horrible experience and i don't intend to experience that ever again. Manager was very messy talk about people. That was a very unorganized store the manager and assisted manager was always starting mess.
bad,Too much work and responsibilty is given to you. Their expectations are unrealistic. Manager didn't do much and gave all their work to its associates.
bad,They cut hrs or move you store without telling you they promise advancement then give it to whoever they want even if they have only been there 3 days
bad,"I liked the people I worked with  other than my manager.  She would make other employees work  7 to 16 days in a row. She would never work nights so everybody else always had to work.  if an employee would call off. She would call other people to come in (which is okay to do) and work for them. But if she couldn’t find anyone else to work, she wouldn’t work. She didn’t rotate people on weekends, so I would pretty much have to work every weekend unless I requested it off. Which she would not approve!"
bad,People were friendly but the management was bi est they would give there friends and family hours where everyone else worked seven hours a week. They had no benifits
bad,"I gave 2 stars because it could have potential, it just requires higher powers changing key instruments they lean heavily on and not being greedy with salaries...."
bad,"Really sad place in my scenario. I had a couple good friends that made it livable for a while. While I was working there I learned how terrible people can be, but I did meet a few nice people."
bad,I feel like there was never enough hours so I left because It didn't support me or my family it would be better for a kid just getting out of school though
bad,"a typical day are work would be getting a phone call from my manager telling me he either would show up late or not at all or to tell me that i would be working by myself for a majority of the day "
bad,"I was hired not knowing when I was going to work. Hired 2 months before first day of work, only to be needed 5 days total. It took a month to get paid. Managers gave me runaround instead of transfer and explanation. Spent more than I made. There is a huge disconnect with corporate and regional managers, especially with new stores."
bad,"This location i would by far say one of the worst place i could have worked . There was no control over employees , Checks had to be fixed numerous of times."
bad,"Dollar general does not pay nearly enough for the amount of responsibility you have. They want your job to become your life & when you can't work a certain day or shift, it's almost like you're automatically shunned."
bad,She does not know ow to be a manager and the assistant manager is just as bad they are trying to hire an 18 year old kid to di my job so its time for me to leave
bad,if you are a store manager plan on work around 60+hours a week with only one day off. Very very stressful.they don't give enough payroll to get all the tasks done. Therefore sm has to fill in all the hours needed. No sick days are available. If you have the flu you still have to come in or use your vacation hours.no work/ life balance dollar General will be your first home and your home will be 2nd. If you have nothing to do and don't mind being at work all the time this is the job for you
bad,"Expected to work under any and all conditions and will be wrote up over anything if you aren't one of the favorites. Manager and assistant manager rarely pull closing shifts when most hard work is expected to be done. Morning shifts have no less than 3 people working and evening shift only always has 2 people working. One to work register, which can not be left due to busy hours, and the other to work floor and clean up whole store by themselves. No matter how many times its been suggested that more people work evening not only because of all extra work but for security reasons, they will not do it"
bad,"Working at dollar general is not really a career job in my opinion. It fits well with a part-time job to start out with if you are just getting out of school and/or it is your first job, but i would recommend trying somewhere else first."
bad,"It's an unthankful job, very cut throat. They don't care about the customers, just their ratings. Are willing to hurt others to get ahead. Not willing to look at the big picture. Training people to do their job is very lacking."
bad,This company does not invest in their employees. I love our customers and the work but I didn't like the lack of training we received nor did I like the pay. This is a salary position and you were required to work up to 60 hours a week. I had hourly employees bringing home more than I did per week.
bad,was one of the worst jobs ive ever had. i worked maybe 4 hours a week and that is with me begging for more hours. i made 7.25 an hour and that was just enough to put in my gas tank to continue to go to work. coworkers disliked my presence due to my skin color. and i felt over all takin advantage of while i was with the company.
bad,"As a key holder you are part of management but on the bottom of the totem pole. There are so much you are expected to do and if the shift before you does not get there job done then it falls back on you and you get in trouble or your job is threatened for it,"
bad,"The time manager was kinda bad. She would change your work times on a daily bases (which they cannot in WV), I do not think she does time now but you are still told to do more then minimum work"
bad,"The customers were horrible. Not only that but the systems need to be updated, they did not fuction most of the time which then caused the customers to get agitated. cigarettes need to be located closer to the counter so you don;t have to leave the register it is very unsafe."
bad,The management was terrible. The boss was highly disrespectful. You work way above what you should have been compensated. They constantly got robbed and solved the problem with 1 week of security.
bad,They aren't organize and they ask you to do more work than what you are getting paid for. They don't value their employees and they hire people who have no idea what the f their doing.
bad,It was not organized. poor management. favoritism no hours. no communication no opportunity to achieve their and it's no fun working with unhappy people .no breaks at times
bad,I was a key holder that got paid 8$ an hr with a max of 8.50 an hr management was no flexible I tried to call in with a legitime family emergency and was told if I didn't come in it would be a voluntary termination.
bad,"Was treated quite terribly here."
bad,"Dollar General is a terrible place to work due to poor management and a lack of accommodations for the employees."
bad,"Stressful, left me all alone for hours and expected me to get the shelves stocked and take care of the customers.  I liked waiting on customers.  I would have liked working more hours and not to be left alone there. At the store on Old Mitchell Road store"
bad,Hours are constantly being changed with very short notice. I feel as if management expects employees to drop anything to cover for people the call in regularly. Hours are given according to job title. So a employee may have a bad work ethic but the title they hold will give them more hours than a employee that has a good work ethic. This puts a good worker in a position where they get the short end of the stick regardless of how much they come through for the store. It is unfair.
bad,It just your average run of the mill retail space nothing spectacular or alluring the environment is very stagnant and growth isn't likely its definately not for someone trying to build a life.
bad,"I would not recommend working here unless you are a kid and just need extra cash. The management is very poor, and the DM is even worse. They are cut throat to their own employees."
bad,The people who work are over worked.  The personnel is mostly young people their first job and they don't care.  Management only cared that the shift was covered and they didn't have to work. Management allowed us workers to be verbally abused by customers everyday.  I was called in every week either early or on day off because employees called in and was never repermanded.
bad,The store is a mess and management is pitiful. I really dislike working here. The store is not managed well. Always want you to work onyour off days. Stocking is a joke because nobody wants to work.
bad,Lack of employees puts a lot of pressure on the ones still working there. Incompetent managers and up can make the workload more stressful than it should be.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is horrible, never do their jobs correctly. Very unfair treatment between supervisors and employees. Favoritism is how this company works."
bad,You do not get enough hours. You do not get paid enough for the job that you do. Not able to advance in pay or job. Always cutting hours. Computer system not up to date at the store I worked out..
bad,poor company that gets worse the higher up you go. low pay no benefits & very high turnover. toxic culture in the workplace save a few other employees.
bad,This job was hard and long with the lazy management. The working hours were crazy and badly planned. The story front was always trashed with ashes and ends.
bad,"A typical day consisted of running around like a chicken with out a head. Time limits on everything, and sales being high didn't matter if you job wasn't done you got wrote up.  Managment had no postives for any employees, always hateful. At one point told me I couldn't have a day off for a doctor's appointment, told me to reschedule it."
bad,I enjoyed the customers and helping them find the items they were looking for and the pride in when they said how nice the store looked and  how friendly the workers are. The down fall was the managment and how the hours were set to working.
bad,"Poor management from dm down. Hardly gave hours,but when they call you on a day off to come in took one of your other days. Never provide support, never enough on a shift expect you to stay longer with out asking.  Hrs changed daily can't make plans. Played favorites. Couldn't get supplies the store needed. The one I worked at had a register down for 6 months,no one tried to fix it. Employees getting assaulted wouldn't get security. Kept everyone PT"
bad,"Does not care about employee needs or life outside of DG."
bad,I feel that myself as an employee was not cared about u feel that u was just a number and they could not hold on to my job when I was in pain and needed surgery.The upper management talked about the employees like they were garbage.
bad,"Spent days cleaning stuff, stocking shelves, and working a busy register all at once with no help from my 1st day on the job until my last day. This job definitely was one of the worst, because there was no team work, no proper communication, no structure. ect"
bad,The whole district was understaffed because of a lack in benefits or competitive wage. Therefore every employee worked 6 or 7 days a week and long hours. Management made the it worse by having unrealistic expectations and negative feedback towards its employees.
bad,"It started off fine enough, but I never received a pay raise. I didn't like the style of management, and my hours were inconsistent. I would never work there again."
bad,"Not good money, not much for career advancement. not the best training. hours sucked. customers are awful. it was a pretty boring job and un-motivating as well."
bad,"This company has unrealistic expectations , they require you to get things done with limited man hours to complete your task. For lack of better words it is always chaos, from employees calling off, to shift managers resigning a day before you go on vacation."
bad,I would never again work at a Dollar General. There are a variety of reasons why i wouldn't work there but the top three reasons are 1)To many hours in the work week 2)Poor working environment 3)Poor upper management.
bad,Now this is a little biased and out of date but the manager that was in charge when I worked there didn't like me and tried to blame large amounts of missing money on me on days I didn't work. The customers are not pleasant and management needs to learn how to balance workers.
bad,At dollar general employees come and go to quickly. Things never get done right or on time. As a manager I was always running around doing things behind everyone because there was no re-enforcement from either store manager.
bad,"Management in this place is about as bad as Life Care, I learned that you need to work together to get things done and the employees around you do not do anything to help you, hardest part of the job doing every one else's job, most enjoyable part of the day is leaving."
bad,This company makes promises that are not kept. Work environment is poor and very stressful. In my current location there is no real security to protect the staff from harm and or theft.
bad,"The company is a great place to work for but the Dollar General I worked at was poorly managed. When I worked there, I had a family emergency and needed to leave early and the manager said he wasnt going to cover my shift because he didnt want to work that day. They gave me less than 10 hours a week. The security was so bad and we really needed it in that neighborhood. Ive known people that work at different Dollar Generals and loved it. It all depends on the management."
bad,A typical day you don't have time for a break or lunch if you wanted to get all your task done on a closing shift. I would be at the store for a hour plus with no help. Management did not allow me to help with any decisions on who to hire nor did she want to hear my opinion.
bad,"not horrible company unless you are in ""forgotten store'"
bad,"The best part of working at Dollar General is dealing with the public on a daily basis. A typical day at Dollar General consists of cashiering, stocking freight, maintaining a pleasant environment for customers and a clean store by sweeping, washing and dusting. Other duties consist of counting in and counting out drawers, counting change fund, doing returns, voids and preparing the nightly store deposit while banking for the store."
bad,As a manager you will put in a lot of hours with little pay. Employee turn around is high; changes required to the store on a weekly basis.  Not enough employees and many times left by self in the store (unsafe).
bad,"The final store manager I had, was the reason for me leaving. Poor communication skills, did not know how to make a schedule and she played favorites."
bad,Working at Dollar General I was in a car accident and could not work. I went to my store manager and she was not the best stated that I would need to contact the district manager. I contacted him with the situation and he was rude from the beginning of the conversation.
bad,"Stay away ,  part time minimum wage yet want you on call 7 days a week,"
bad,A typical day at dollar general is being disrespected and taken advantage of. I've learned how to deal with people rudeness and disrespect. The most enjoyable thing about this job is clocking out.
bad,"Corporate retail is a tough business.  There is little room for advancement, there is no individual recognition, and there is always an element of distrust. Because allotted working hours are so limited a small,  cohesive, hardworking team is essential to a successful store."
bad,"Dollar General is a stressful Job, they expect so much with so little time and very minimum  people, upper management as well as other  sm are not team players."
bad,"As long as I've working for this company I've been treated very poorly , although I give my all it goes unnoticed. I do all I can to get the job done , but the DM treats me very horrible ."
bad,They have me working all nights when the family is home.  I have told them I need to work days so I can be home with the family at night but they keep putting me on nights.
bad,I enjoyed working with the customers and my co-workers. The management above the store manager made it very difficult to enjoy the job not giving enough hours to schedule employees which resulted in myself and store manager working 6-7 days a week.
bad,"I enjoyed my job as far as Asst. Manager but the Manager was not professional and did not follow corporate rules, I do. The hardest part was when I knew I was correct by the book and the Manager would not let me do my job correctly."
bad,"This is a good job for people that like to be busy.  Between, cleaning, stocking, and customers, there is always something to do. You will learn planograms if you have not already. However, district managers are paid to largely tear down managers and employees, They will come in to a clean, neat, often complimented on store, and say it is dirty, unorganized, etc. Nothing the manager did was right, nothing associates was doing was right. Corporate set unrealistic goals, such as being able to put away so many totes in an hour while waiting on customers at the same time. Hours are long, usually 10 hour shifts."
bad,"The job is not very difficult. The best part of the job was interactions with customers. A typical day would start by clocking in, verifying cash drawer amount, signing in to the cash register and ringing up customers. In between customers you would need to be able to stock shelves, address customer concerns, organize stock on shelves and remove any broken or returned items to the proper place in the storage room. At the end of the day it was required to sweep and mop store floors, clean bathrooms and wait on shift manager to complete end of day totals and paperwork."
bad,"dont pay the employees enough money!! for what they have to do and to put up with...this jobs needs to be paid more than 7.25 an hour...who can make a living on this, when you have a family"
bad,"very slow and boring"
bad,"I've worked a few warehouses before so when I got laid off I thought I come over here and things would be the same, they arent."
bad,"My view of Dollar General is horrible, i did not enjoy it as much as i enjoyed my other past jobs, they were very inconsistent, unorganized, pay was unfair, the hours were unfair and so were the managers i wouldnt go back"
bad,Management took longer breaks then any one in the store if I took 5 min I was lucky called in once do to being hospitalized over night and lost my team lead position do to that which caused me to decide to quit and look for a better place to work
bad,i believe it was just my location but I felt like I was being forced to find another job. they were constantly finding reasons not to give me hours and i was only getting 4 a week
bad,Awful company to be employed by. Part time employees receive no benefits. Wages are terrible even for full time employees. Very unsafe work environment. The stores are robbed occasionally. Schedules aren't very flexible
bad,I enjoyed my years with DG until this past year which almost ruined my love of retail. I tried to reach out to HR to resolve the issues with no response and was left completely on my own with unprofessional employees that were related to other managers
bad,"High turnover, employee mistrust, over worked and under paid for multiple tasks. Inept and high turnover in management, unsafe working conditions, terrible problems with the heating and AC and multiple breakdowns resulting in customer and employee discomfort. Hours were family hostile if in a key holder or management position. Obtaining time off for vacations, family crisis limited and rare. I put in ten years of dedicated time and never reached making 10 dollars an hour."
bad,You have to balance and multitask between multiple tasks. Very fast paced. Have to know how to prioritize.  Have to work on days off sometimes.
bad,"Lack of training new managers, not enough budgeted hours for the work load. No support help from upper management to get solutions for arising problems. Security is not provided for stores robbed multiple times."
bad,I think for the amount of work that they want from you and the amount of hands on training that this company overall is lacking in management.
bad,"For me, Dollar General was a terrible company to work for. The district manager was rude, he didn't listen to anything that we told him we needed. Our store manager was abusive and made all of the crew seem like we were incompetent. For the rate of pay to work ratio I would say we were being underpaid by at least four dollars. The way we were worked was almost slave-like and then certain managers would expect you to work off the clock without pay."
bad,The job wasn't bad at all but all of the employees were. It was a terrible environment where people would constantly bad mouth each other behind each others back and I didn't like that.
bad,didn't work me that much at all like two days a week and 4 hours a day I wouldn't recommend for anyone to work there it was horrible waste my gas to go to work and only get 4 hours a day maybe two or three days a week if that if I was lucky
bad,Very rude management not very good hours. Poor life work relationship. Poor pay and not very nice to the costumers. Poor explanation of how to do job.
bad,"basic duties as a retail worker, cashiering and sales floor assisting customers find items stocking shelves handling money"
bad,I was hired as a stocker but was placed on a register days after being hired. Unfriendly customers and employees made the job alot harder than it should've been. management was terrible.
bad,the company is very organized but there is no work life balance. stores are short on payroll which requires store salaried managers to be in store more than 60 hours a week
bad,I worked at dollar general for 8 months. I busted my butt off and covered everyone elses shifts. I finished my assigned rolltainers and uboats and would get in trouble for others. I was not management or a team leader or a key holder. I was a regular CSR. They put too much responsibilities on us and we do not recieve anywhere near the pay that we should.
bad,This was the first and only job I ever had that I absolutely loved and didn't mind working all the extra hours that I did work. The management was not trustworthy and being this was my first retail job I learned that I have more morals than the people in this line of work. A very hard lesson learned but it was learned. As far as life balance there wasn't any and the job did take advantage of any opportunity to let you fill any hours (knowing your a single mom struggling) because people just didn't show up.  I learned that you cant judge a person by there cover.
bad,"not a great place to work, the amount of work that one is excepted to do is a lot compared to the salary they give, never any raises no matter what or how much you do."
bad,"I learned lots of problem solving skills when dealing with customers"
bad,"Poor Employment "
bad,"When I was given the opportunity to work for dollar general I explained that I was a single mother with kids and I gave  her the hours I could work, she said fine. the first two weeks was okay, but then they started scheduling me when i would have to drop my kids off to school and when i would have to pick them up. I was the only sales associate and there were three managers there. I didn't like working their because I started to see them do illegal activities on the job and the coworkers always gossiping about each other. There was no teamwork. I enjoyed serving the customers and helping them find what they need."
bad,"they expect you to do all the same tasks as management,  they will fire someone for the smallest thing.  You are expected to come in on your days off if called or you are told that your job is not secure."
bad,"Typically all the managers get the hours the rest of the team members are only hired on for part time work  which is any where from 14-18 hours a week which is not a pay to live by unless your a teenager just making a little play money ."
bad,Everything I learned here I taught myself through previous employment. You get your schedule the day before the new week. Its just not for business-minded people.
bad,"I disliked working as a Sales Associate for Dollar General. I believe that it was mostly the area the store was located in. We were constantly being broken in to and people (including some employees) would steal on several occasions. Management was somewhat decent. I believe I had 4 managers in a 5 month time frame. The store had potential, but not enough employees applied themselves."
bad,The company has varied hours i work and the manager is never there.
bad,I really like my customers but I feel I was not properly trained to be third key holder
bad,"Typical day includes Store Manager and one cashier.  Store manager is responsible for all work on the sales floor, while cashier is responsible for checking customers.  Too little hourly pay roll hours.  Store Managers are salary and are required 45 hours a week min.  However, that is a LOW estimate.  Store Managers will spend 60+ in order to complete all sales floor merchandising, resets, covering calls off etc."
bad,"I learned while working at DG, that even in the work place sometimes it only takes one person to change it all. When i came to DG there was no manager, only 4 employees, horrible training, and favoritism. No full time was available, after promotion to manager i still made less than the other lower rank employees."
bad,"I was the college girl hired to work nights and weekends to give the other managers a break to go home to their families and get things done. While I didn't complain about this, I had made it very clear from the beginning that I would need certain days off for student obligations, including the Christmas break, and Spring break. But when the time came for me to leave, even with advanced warning and a clearly marked calendar, management was unhappy with me taking so much time off for Christmas to the point where I seriously questioned if I would have a job or not when I came back. Fortunately, I did, but when the same situation arose for Spring Break, (advance notice, clearly marked calendar) management gave me so much fuss and a distinct ""Your job needs to come first,"" conversation, that I politely gave my two weeks notice and never looked back."
bad,"an awful place to work."
bad,The job wasn't really horrible just the management. The co-workers were awesome to work with.
bad,They only care about the store and company. The well-being of the people running the store they do not care !
bad,"I didn't really like the treatment I received from Dollar General, It was very unorganized."
bad,Dollar General can be a friendly work environment. You must be able and willing to work weekends as well as week days. You must be available to work day and evening shifts. You must be good at multitasking and able to life up to 50 lbs. Prior experience with cash registers and retail are a plus.
bad,Just helping each customer to satisfy his or her needs. How to be apart of a team. Not very helpful. Very helpful fun and outgoing. Maintaning a 40 hour work week. Nothing really overall a terrible company to work for.
bad,"Well the job consist of balancing cash drawer, making sure that i give back the correct change and issue the customers there receipt. I also clean and did stock when needed or necessary."
bad,"This particular store could not become organized.  However, it did make a lovely place to shop.  There was more managers than they knew what to do with and not enough hourly employees.  It was discombobulated."
bad,"A day at work resulted anywhere between 8 to 12 hours of work, throwing cases to hit rate. I learned teamwork was very important and there was no time for laziness at the work place. Staying on your toes and active with benefit everyone in the work place."
bad,i stock the shelf it wasn't nothing hard about the job. i mean the job was easy it's just the pay..
bad,"Cashier, putting out totes, and answering customer questions."
bad,"I've been working for this company for the past 2 years.  The open door policy IS NOT OPEN!  If you want to keep your job, it'd be best to keep all thoughts and opinions to yourself.  I have only received 1 raise(.25) for the 2 years I've been here..  The store(s) are always in disarray and there are never enough hours, I'm listed as full-time, but only receive 20-30 hrs. a wk, I was told that I can NOT get 40 hrs., they're reserved for management ONLY! We don't allow customers to use the restroom because of the state they leave it, and theft is an ongoing problem. The manager chases down shoplifters (in his car) and also has no respect for employees much less customers.  Every Dollar General I've visited or worked at, it seems the management ""thinks"" they own the place. The pay is NOT great for an adult, but for a student it's ok.. I am an easygoing person, but this job has REALLY stressed me out! But what can I do, I need a job..."
bad,"At first, my experience with this company was very positive. Near full-time hours, flexible scheduling, and stability. After a few weeks, I went from working 30+ hours a week to 8-12 hours a week in an effort to minimize costs. Over the first 3 months, I went through 5 managers and was sent to different stores in the area in order to receive hours. This company has some potential, however my experience there was less than pleasant and I was unable to make a living wage losing over 3/4 of my hours."
bad,"make food"
bad,"Upper management was oblivious to store conditions. Needed to be aware of store managers lack of professionalism towards customers, employees and vendors on numerous occasions. Was released due to managers inability to count funds correctly."
bad,Had no management what so ever people could do what they wanted
bad,Dollar General is a fun place also hard place to work. I learned so much about running the cash register and stocking. Management was awful. They was always in a bad mood and quick to have a attitude when you needed help. The hardest par of the job was getting along with the manager. The enjoyable part was getting to meet people.
bad,"I started at one store and was done really dirty, I transferd to another store and now it is starting all over again I would never tell anyone to go work for this company........"
bad,Manager couldn't keep up so....
bad,Management was unprofessional. My co-workers were loud and they didn't want to listen. The hardest part of my job was everyone had a messed up attitude and very unprofessional. Very unhappy there.
bad,"Everyday you would walk in and follow the schedule which was the same thing week by week. Working here taught me my register skills and helped me on my customer greeting skills. The management is different at every store. Corporate, treats all employees like they are theives no matter what you do. My co-workers had experience way longer than me and were pretty stuck up when I was the ""new girl"". The hardest part of the day was trying to get started. Trying to count my draw to start on the register was so crowded and un-organized. The part I enjoyed the most was meeting all the unique and different customers and getting to know the ""regulars""."
bad,They do not pay enough money for the work that you do. Then they don't hire enough people to cover other people's shifts.
bad,Management works you to the bone.
bad,Not a very good paying job. Will not give you enough hours to make a good paying job.
bad,"Worst job ever had in a lifetime, expected to work 6 days at least 10 hours a day. And that is if you are lucky"
bad,"This is my second time working for the company, and as the first time I love my co workers, managment included. The district however is a different story. Goals are set only to benefit the district, and if those un real goals are not met then your in trouble. I feel a company shouldnt be allowed to do these things, not to mention I was a fool to think I would be given the things promised and discussed during my re hire."
bad,"Staff Laziness!! Underpaid management!!  Store is always a complete disaster. Hours are few or you are completely overworked. Never enough registers open, meaning long lines and disgruntled customers.  District manager points out the obvious areas of concern but no help in correction."
bad,"This is a company that hires and fires daily. Constant heavy lifting, micromanaging, and drama. You will be expected to stock, watch for theft, clean, all while doing cash register. You will be fired and replaced if you're unable to handle it all. Expect to be called in on every one of your days off because of people quitting."
bad,when I was working at Dollar General the manager and the supervisor was stealing for the job for months before someone caught them. Then after the got fired they didn't hired anymore for almost 6 months and the whole job just went down hill.
bad,As a Store manager for them you do everything from Maintenance of the building to stocking the shelves and everything in between. I run every aspect of the business.
bad,"Started off well,but the upper management then replaced the manager in my first week. Hours were good but pay was low. If you show a want to work store would take advantage of that and work you into ground. Company policy of extreme customer service is a problem since most customers will take advantage of it."
bad,i did not love my experience there. there was not much sustaining work or promotions to stay and my co-workers were not willing to budge or act accordingly to many things.
bad,"Constant call ins...many times you are by yourself. Trying to run a million dollar store on 147 hours of payroll per week."
bad,"Pros: getting to work with people and see the ""regulars"""
bad,"The managers are not properly trained . They are very rude to their employees, their expectations are beyond reality. They put in very little effort to help when there is a problem , and they have very little respect for their employees"
bad,"scheduling was always done the week of instead of a week ahead, like other locations, favoritism when making schedules, "
bad,Minimal pay for alot of work. Not alot of training and more responsibility than what paid for. Repetitive work like facing shelves daily. There are never more than 3 employees in the building at a time usually only 2.
bad,I don’t believe upper Management is respectful. Empty offers and promises. I worked extremely hard and worked day and night with 1 or 0 other employees at a time and was expected to shine a t&@d. 16 hour days and early conference calls before shift. Only one on register and trying to recover and stock at the same time. Store Managers have a high turnover rate because there wasn’t the support they needed
bad,The workers are under paid and over worked. Never enough hours or right pay rate to hire help in the stores. The product is ok for the most part. High volume stores need more people to help checkout and put out stock
bad,It wasn’t horrible working there but most of the time they schedule one person for the whole store and an entire shift which means no bathroom breaks and can’t really get anything done because you have to take care of customers or leave your register.  Then get yelled because nothing was done as far as stocking and cleaning.
bad,Management makes false promises to employees desperate for any job they can find and slowly revoke said promises. There is such little incentive to advance in an actual career that they sooner bring in managers from other branches than properly train staff up through the ranks.
bad,Dollar General would be a nice place to work or so I thought. Management was unfair and to be quite honest the hours just made the job worse.  The manager that I had to work with never did anything so that made my job even harder! If I needed help she would get an attitude.  I was given the worst possible hours still did it but finally had enough and  I quit after my first month I couldn't take it anymore. I had to work every Sunday. I made friends with a few co workers. I never even got paid. I never knew what I was supposed to do no one would ever tell me and jobs from day to day were never the same.
bad,"I worked for DG for almost a year. At first it was simple work, stocked products waited on customers ran register. Usually were a person short of a full staff. Was supposed to get a pay raise never did became LSA finally got a dollar raise and basically became like an assistant manager. Was supposed to only close a few nights a week manager and assistant manager were friends outside of work so ended up closing almost every night then doing a turn around and opening the store on Sunday mornings."
bad,"To put it simply, working at Dollar General is the equivalent of working two+ jobs at once, while also being paid minimum wage, receiving very few hours, and having no advancement opportunities. The only benefits available to Dollar General workers are infrequent coupons on the official app.  Even then, it's usually something small like a free candy bar or energy drink. The majority of my job involved constantly running between the cash register and the sales floor. There isn't even a bell or something similar for customers to notifiy you that they need service, so I constantly had to look around corners to see if someone was standing at the register before quickly making my way to the front of the store to assist them. I worked there for over a year and didn't get a single hour of PTO or any vacation days. "
bad,"I love working for dollar general I just don’t like the fact that they have you working off the clock, working while on break, taking your time from you without your knowledge"
bad,"My first manger was fired for stealing and working us off the lock. The second manager was great at first till she started firing people because they were the only black person on the crew, then started firing everyone to hire her family and friends. I took a 3 month maturity leave and when I had returned she told me there were no open positions but the next day had a sign up for open interviews"
bad,"Casue they will want you to phyically be in three places working as fast as possible at the same time. Runa register, stock/block and clean all at once."
bad,"I was promised 20 hours a week at the tome of hire and tokd management since the time of my application that i could not work Sundays due to no bus service that day but was continually put on the schedule for that day, w\When reporting on actions not acceptable by company policy i was told to mind my own business, I cant speak for all Dollar generals but the location i worked was continually poor,"
bad,It was a good job. Online the average pay for a sales associate was 8$ but they only paid me $7.25 an hour. I was only supposed to get up to 36 hours a week but since I was the only sales associate I was red flagged every week for having over 40 hours. I worked really hard and thought I made an advancement to become manager. I knew I could but they brought someone else in before I could prove myself.
bad,Didn't get the hour's that i wanted they keeped  changing the schedule every day or every other day. They are nice they to work with but sometimes they don't like putting stuff away in the right spots.
bad,"I never had even a chance to move up in this company. This was by far the worst job related experience in my life. I was fired over the phone by a distrit manager at 8am. For purchasing policies then after applying for unemployment benefits I was denied because of Dollar Generals accusations against me. "
bad,"I was promised in 3-4 months I would be promoted to key holder position I explained before I started I did not want to be just an associate forever. Also because I didn't grow up from there they treated me like an outcast, I had one friend there the rest looked for petty things to cause work strife rather than build us up as a team. No one likes the manager whose worked for her, she is way too demanding and doesn't explain things well...you are left to guess at what she wanted or meant because if you ask you get reprimanded."
bad,Overall a scam of a company full of greedy people who don't care how their employees or customers are treated and don't care about quality or cleanliness
bad,Dollar General that company is a good place to work however the store that I worked at had poor management she forced us to work off the clock she belittled her employees as well as spreading your personal information
bad,The job is okay. But they don't always want to give you raises. They ask you to work off the clock. Which is not right. A lot of people that work they don't want to help.
bad,"To much back stabing, work you with so much to do and not enough people. And some times there by yourself for like 4 hours. Then want to know why you didn't get things done."
bad,"You have to love what you do, in order to stay. Over worked, management lacks commitment. No advances unless the store manager becomes exhausted and leave or discoveries a new opportunity elsewhere."
bad,"Irregular hours, lied to during interview about hours and days I’d be scheduled for. Low pay for job duties. Hostile working environment and employees allowed to disregard management"
bad,"My time with DG can best be summed up as unrealistic expectations. Always understaffed, never time to stock and straighten up the store. I started as a cashier and ended up an assistant manager."
bad,"Did not care to be in 27 million places at once, if someone were to come in with a gun yes we have cameras but it is very easy to steal from this place even with 2 employees, sometimes 3 working. The pay wasn't not affordable for living rate people had to live with there parents or a partner to be working here. This is for sure a starting out job but you are crazy if they is somewhere to make a career out of."
bad,"Training was abysmal. Store manager did not attempt to teach policies, methods, practices, etc. would not recommend Dollar General to anyone. Very hostile work environment and management attitudes."
bad,"It was okay could've been a better work environment, the management needs to be better, the store needs to look a lot cleaner.  And the theft need to go down a whole lot."
bad,Stay away from this company. I wasted 3 years of my life there and going to school at the same time. The store was only open 14 hours a day and I would be scheduled to work 10-12 hour shifts. I would consistently be called in on my days off to the point where I couldn't plan anything on my days off because I knew I would have to work. My boss left me alone one day all day long to go get matching tattoos. I was always being called to go work in other stores. Also really crummy pay. After three years I wasn't even making 8/hr. No benefits at all. And the stores themselves are just horrible stores.
bad,Was really stressful. Manager was unprofessional. Expected other employees to take blame for her actions. Was expected to be off the clock while counting safe and register money. If corporate would listen to employee complaints it would be a better place to work.
bad,Everyone is out for themselves . They teach the wrong thing to do and don't care who they hurt. It is very important to be a good person but I've yet to meet one here.
bad,The structure of the store was unorganized and people in different positions were doing managerial jobs for less pay. Store manager did not know how to properly communicate with staff.
bad,"I get there and do stock until five o'clock depending on what time I get there. After stock we take a normal break as usual then come back to do recovery, which makes the shelves look neat, and a list of specified things to keep the store looking good. Then we have to finish the list of duties assigned by our Store Manager, and she has pushed everyone away because she is so hard on all of the employees. Telling us we never do our jobs and what we do is never good enough. After everything else is done we mop the store and count the deposit and then we clock out and go home. Overall, its not a hard job I am just looking for something better at the moment. I will not work in a place where I do not feel comfortable talking to my boss about an issue I have at work or anything related."
bad,Dollar General Warehouse in Scottsville was the worst work experience ever. The management team is absolutely terrible. They allow certain individuals to do whatever they want. But then expect the others to make up the slack. They don’t have a set schedule. You never know what days and what hours you’ll be working. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. It’s too stressful.
bad,"basically just a job, if your okay with not having a set schedule or hours. With this job you need a lot of self control to deal with customers and the workers."
bad,Overworked ya I was lucky if at times I get my lunch break at a normal time! Never got any 15mins breaks worked hard to get no reconciliation for the hard work you did!
bad,"This place sucked, well at least this specific location. Managers are rude and inconcederate. Always switching up on weather or not they like you. Two faced."
bad,Do not like Dollar General because they just were bad. Had no respect for employees and messed up schedules. Never told anyone when they were working and always put schedule up late so you wouldn't know.
bad,The job itself is not bad.  Most customers and fellow coworkers are great.  Management is not the best.  Could have better management training creating better leaders instead of just managers.
bad,"Typical day at wrk.hot being treated like a slave.n they dnt treat u nice.they r all abt money npt their employes or customers its all abt money"
bad,I wouldn't say it's just managment. It's also the company. They demand too much for not enough pay. People come and go fast. You would think being a hardworking loyal employee they would make you want to stay and feel secure in your job. That's not the case with this company. Your replaceable no matter what.
bad,Managers there are very unprofessional and rude to employees as well as their customers. Lead cadhiers and other employees are the ones who go the extra mile for their customers.
bad,"When applying for this job, a manager told me to run and I should have listened to her. It is complete chaos all the time. No one can tell when an employee is coming or going, no other staff to help you during a rush, all machinery was outdated, the rules were never explained, and our manager expected upmost perfection at all times."
bad,poor management. Lack of help. High turn around rate. At times you could be the only person working in a huge store for at least 2 hours. A lot of lost inventory in store.
bad,Store manager didn't care about employees. Not enough employees to get job completed daily. Store manager would leave for hours and report that he was at work all day. Store manager didn't treat employees fairly.
bad,"Work by yourself alone in the store too many hours. During this time your productivity is extremely limited. Allocated hours does not help control shrink when there is only one employee, which is a manager playing cashier for up yo 25 plus hours per week in a perenial corporayely challenged store."
bad,The manager is not a manager. She talks about her employees to each other. She doesn't work or help the other workers with the store. She take smoke breaks all the time
bad,"Way too much happened during my time with this company, and maybe I just got a bad hand in regards to my timing with the position, but I will say that I put so much effort and literal blood, sweat, and tears into the job just to have it constantly threatened every time I wasn't able to complete the impossible list of tasks I was given. I wouldn't recommend this job if it was the only thing to save my life."
bad,"Upper level management is terrible, they don’t support the employees, only the bottom end and how much of that ends up in their pocket. Constant customers stealing and threatening you, always osha violations, cleaning up after other people’s mess or children. Horrible pay for management, way too much work and stress."
bad,"As a cashier, I wasn't paid the minimum amount for the position. Should've been .25 - .50 more. I have over 10 years exp as a cashier but the manager said she's not allowed to pay over $7.50. My paychecks then start becoming lighter after my probation period, than they should be, by like$20-$25. Then, it increases but the manager refuses to help me at all; saying that ""you can go in the portal and change it yourself"". No, the keyholder isn't supposed to do that either so how can the cashier?? That was for my last paycheck that was $75 short! So, I worked 10 hours for free and I received absolutely no help whatsoever. "
bad,"Manager is rude and cuts hours. People no call no showed and still were able to keep there job "
bad,"You work so hard you feel like you were hit by a semi truck at the end of every day; your boss, district manager and human resources never listen to a word anyone says; customers literally scream and cuss you out because of company policies; your highest chance for advancement is possibly store manager(if you don't kill yourself first); you receive a raise of 25 cents once every 18 months even though you have the highest seniority and sacrifice your life and sanity for the company; your boss will scream at you in front of customers and publicly humiliate you; the only good thing is that you might one day see your boss get fired for some petty policies."
bad,I was fired bc I was late because my tire blew out on the highway. They don't care about you at all. They only care if you make it on time you are nothing but a number on a sheet to them
bad,"I am a LSA/Key Holder. When I interviews I was told that I would be a SA & not a LSA. I was also told the postulation would be full time. Once I actually got the job I quickly learned that I went from Full Time SA to Part Time LSA. LSA is basically performing the functions of the AM when they’re out.  On average myself & four other employees get about 20hours or less a week. The Manager & AM are the only ones who gets enough hours to live off of. The customers are wonderful but Dollar General is unrealistic when it comes to what they expect. First, the online training they expect you to finish after only giving you 4 or 5 hours over the course of a few days to complete. I went into the job doing exactly what the training videos stated as Dolar General policies. Once I realized I was the only one doing the right thing I got fed up. I would be the only one working while other employees would hide, disappear, and just do whatever. As a new employee I figured the managers knew how their employees operated so I didn’t bother to inform them how lax they were. Second, They want you to recover the store, stock the store, watch for people stealing, and cashier in between all that. Basically you’re running back and forth all day doing a millions things getting pulled in a million directions by customers and God Forbid you don’t get to a rolletainer or tote because you’re so busy with other duties. Too much work, Too much stress for such small hours and pay. They need to follow Walmart’s example and hire Stockers, Cashiers, and Asset Protection. Once I was hired on I realized why the turnover"
bad,It can be a good pleasant place to work depending on the DM and or  Store manager . It’s good pay but no matter what you do it’s never  good enough there’s always something else that you should’ve done
bad,The company over worked the gm and gave no hours for work to get done. There were times the gm would be alone in an open store fot hours because of hours given.
bad,Couldn't depend on management. Kept having to be hospitalized for breathing problems. Asked management to clean out mouse traps so I could continue to work for them and they refused. Took my issue to corporate and they too refused. No job is worth my health.
bad,Fast paced fun job but too many hours in a week. Higher management has clicks and if you are not in one  you are nothing at all to this company. Loved the customers hated the location.
bad,Management is absolutely terrible. Expects to much from a single person but yet doesn’t do anything their self. Is not able to keep enough employees to functionally run a store if someone calls out or doesn’t show. Lack of respect to the workers. Literally just sits in the office on their phones.
bad,The job itself is pretty easy. The turn-over rate is to high and you would see new faces every couple of weeks. There is to much to do in an unreasonable amount of time.
bad,"Where do I begin? Entirely too open-ended when it comes to specific work hours. Changed week by week and all employees were considered on call. Understaffed as a general rule, high expectations on how much a single person can accomplish within their work shift, little to no training, non-existent benefits, a very tricky employee discount (you CAN get one but only if you know to sign up as an employee on their website for digital coupons. My manager did not tell me. I had to find out from another employee months into my time working there. No respect for personal time. Basically you have to make up a reason why you absolutely cannot come in on days off or you will be guilt-tripped into it."
bad,"The job itself isn't that bad. The atmosphere is very welcoming, if the right people are working. Managment prefers to hire from the outside than promoting from within the company."
bad,Unless u absolutely need a job and dying for an income don't even consider working for dollar General..u have to work 7 days a week and sometimes overnight to barely keep up and as a store manager u find urself working by urself till 1 or 2 pm and ur payroll constantly getting cut and then held accountable for being behind on daily tasks and freight .. it is very stressful and physically demanding . Higher management could care less a out ur safety or well being all they care about is that the store is open and they r making the bonus .. stay away unless desperate
bad,The Dollar General has unrealistic expectations of their employees. They understaff and overwork a skeleton crew of employees. Their main concern is money. They do not recognize that their employees have personal lives. The only reason I stayed was because I valued my customers.
bad,Stressful work environment depending on who is in charge. To you are required to think on your feet. Multitasking is a must. You are not just a cashier. You are everything. Doing jobs you don't get paid to do is frequent. Low staffing and hours. I don't know how the company expects a store to be successful with little hours and so much to do.
bad,Dollar General was not a fun job experience for me. They did not want to work off my school schedule and because I was young they treated me like I was a kid even though I was 18.
bad,"management is very poor and people are not treated well, I wouldn't recommend someone working for this company.  Its a good first job for someone with no job experience, its very fast paced."
bad,"The manager I worked for was very petty, and held grudges. I had a death my family and he called me while i was on my way back from out of town and asked was I coming into work that evening. A typical day is you never know what to expect, your basically walking on egg shells until you feel the mood. The hardest part of the job is dealing with uncertainty. The best part is customers coming in and the interaction was great."
bad,If an employee puts their loyalty into a company than the employer should put their loyalty into their employees. Poor management and leadership. Drama. And good ole boy system with who you know vs who works the hardest
bad,"Applied for full time, but was hired as part time without being told and now I am having to almost beg to get more than 10 hrs per week. I am a mom and have been having trouble finding another job currently. I recently moved to the area after getting off of active military orders."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to seek employment at Dollar General as the pay sucks, hours are all over the place (can change at a moments' notice) affecting employee pay i.e. reduction.  Stores are only allowed only a certain number of hours each week for scheduling for work to be completed by the employees.  Examples planagrams being set, stock being put up after the truck has come and gone along with waiting on customers at the same time.  These are some of the examples."
bad,"I as an assistant had my store manager leave the company with no replacement manager ready for hire. In addition to that a few more  aemployees quit leaving me and 4 employees and no other manager. After mainting normal practices such as, recieving truck, stocking freight, keeping every shift staffed. After doing so a woman who was employed by doller tree was hired and i was told i was not expierenced enough but did a great job with the store."
bad,The mangers were usually very rude to works and customers. I learned how to count down a drawer and run a register. Management was very unorganized and didn't give much effort.
bad,"As a store manager prepare to just be a glorified stocker.  Most of your days will consist of throwing freight, stocking shelves, and running the register.  It is a hard life and very difficult to balance life with work in this retail company."
bad,"The manger at this store, was/ is horrible to customers and employees. "
bad,"I loved my co-workers, the hours were horrible. If it wasn't busy they would send us home early knowing we just took a lunch and still make us go home early. Also there was never room for growth."
bad,Dollar general is fast paced i did enjoy that.i like staying busy. Makes the day go by so much faster.I did learn how to work faster short crews  made it difficult to get customers through line without making them irritated.I would stay hardest part of the job was getting customers  through the check out in a hurry with little help
bad,"I would not make this place a career. It should be only a temporary job. There are no opportunities for advancement, and expect no holidays off or weekends. It is a very depressing place to work.."
bad,"Sometimes you are the only one there and you have to get a certain amount of stock out and run the register and take care of customer ,the hours change after the schedule has been made for the week changes made to it sometimes 2 or 3 times the same week never get enough hours to get a good check"
bad,"Dollar General does not care for their employees. There are a lot of responsibilities and tasks that they put on you but only pay you the bare minimum. Management is very messy,  full of drama, have favorite picks when it comes down to the schedule and tasks. "
bad,"I worked for DG 24 years. When I started Cal Turner cared about his employees. We weren’t open any holidays and we didn’t open till noon on Sundays so employees could go to church. We were also given sick leave and stock options in the company. If your store was a million dollar store and had good shrink numbers you could receive up to a ten thousand dollar bonus. When Cal Turner died and the company was sold it changed each year taking away more and more from there employees.  "
bad,As a stocker for dollar General a typical day was just me going through inventory stocking food items and ect helping any customer that needed help while checking dates on food products
bad,"Dollar General was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. There was no balance between work and home, there were constant schedule changes last minute, and I was often belittled for things beyond my control."
bad,"I worked there for a short amount of time, started out there at minimum wage. I told them I was willing to work hard in order to get paid well. I was quickly promoted twice, and after two promotions I still made less than nine dollars an hour. My manager was difficult to get along with, but I did like her. I did confront her on my pay, and I was basically told ''It is what it is.''"
bad,"Cashiers do everything in the store in between checking out customers and sometimes getting busy leaves you not able to get other things done. Cleaning, stocking, paperwork, and counting money."
bad,It depends who is running the store because the manger I had was never their the employees ran the store. And at times had to do his job and still not get recognized for your work
bad,did everything there from cashier to stocking products to counting down the money. most of time i was alone and hated it . but most of the customers cared about safety then my boss did that is sad but if they could keep people i would not mine i am only one person .
bad,Managers are not held accountable for anything. If you don't get along with them you get all the unwanted shifts. If you have a problem there is no way to resolve it if the store manager doesn't care. The district managers aren't any help either. Half the time the managers sit around doing nothing then complain about nothing getting done. They don't train you to do anything besides the cash register you basically have to figure all of it out on your own. Hours weren't bad but not very flexible.
bad,A typical day at work is greeting customers (assisting them in what they are searching for) stock and display inventory.  This workplace is cultural. Management is okay but could be better.
bad,"I was hired to be sticker for general merchandise. Then I got moved to market. Sales went up. I made sure all stocked. Check expiration dates on meats milk. I made sure areas was kept clean.but when came to the 90 day time for dull time benefits all of a sudden my work was poor. I was told speed up stocking full truck to be done in 2 hours.by my self. Never ever was the manager or assistant manager ever on my case"
bad,"they expect allot out of you for a little bit of money."
bad,They are a good  company  the superviser was fit to supervise people. They tell one thing and do another. They was not organized and not fair. They had their favorite there.
bad,"Too much stress, lies, and fakes. "
bad,"It was demanding, stressful, cutthroat, unreasonable demands, hostile work environment. I felt as though my job was threatened daily, there was no off time. You were expected to live in the store overnight trucks demanding Dm and RD."
bad,"A typical work day would consist of daily task.Running register,putting away truck on truck day.Helping the store manager with daily task.Doing a store order"
bad,In the beginning of shift counted money from the register. Brought out boxes that were full of items that needed to be stocked on shelves. Attended to customers if needed help and worked the register. By the end of the shift the money was counted again and some collected into a separate bag. Also mopped the floor before closing.
bad,"Typical day: Arriving at 7:30 to turn on registers open safe. Make sure to get the deposit to the bank, see what vendors are coming that day, what sales have to go up and what sales have to come down (those were one of most important things). Make sure the store is clean and ready for the customers. By 8 we would have 5-10 customers already. "
bad,I don't recommend working for this company. I worked there for over three years and ran a store for a long period of time because they couldn't find a manager. Then when they did they fired me for taking a sip of a drink while standing in line to pay for it.
bad,I was often left to do things on my own that should take at least 2-3 people to do. They did work with my school schedule. Sadly management seemed to vanish at every turn.  To go talk on their phones or take smoke breaks. It's a very horrible practice to write someone up for a drawer count down being a penny over or under. You lose employees quick like that.
bad,"Management always complained about having to get task done and took it out on the employees. Never really a team atmosphere. Managers where allowed to go out and smoke whenever they wanted and take as many breaks as they wanted, employees were lucky to get one break that they had to clock out for, for less than 15 minutes."
bad,"My manager was not flexible with me, knowing I could not afford day care and when I cold not come in due to the fact I had nobody to watch my child, it would be a right up. They're very sloppy and unorganized. Loss of money was always a big thing for the store I worked at because money would randomly ""come up missing"" I was in charge of stocking the whole store while the other mangers just sat around and watched."
bad,"As long as you make the manager happy the tell you what you want to hear just to keep you working."
bad,Too many robberies in this company and nothing is being done to try and chance it. Very careless toward store managers like they dont think you have a life outside of work.
bad,Poor management. General manager Would hire friends and family and never worked out. Always short or payroll hours. Was expected to work 50plus hours a week.
bad,I worked there for over than just a few months. The place is just a revolving door of employees. I was treated like a manager but wasnt paid like it and was treated worse. The store was constantly at conflict with its customers. It was always cluttered and nothing followed store regulations and couldn't even lead to customer and fire accidents. That store really wasnt safe with how management handled it. Management was corrupt and never followed guidelines and clocked out early and left the rest of us to fend for ourselves. They once hit another customer in the parking lot and it was clearly their fault and they tried to smear the customers name around town. It's a small town but everyone knew that the customer was in the eight and boycotted the store. The only reason we had what customers we did was due to passer through from I 65 and to get small things the rest of the stores did not have close by. The store was a pawn.
bad,"When I worked at dollar general, I liked the job sometimes. I always usually closed and everything was fine for a couple of hours then I would always end up being the only person doing anything while everyone was in the office on Snapchat, Messenger, etc. One person can’t take care of everything in the store by themselves. Every time I called for help I got snapped at over nothing. It’s a good job, if you’re wanting to do stuff by yourself and alone."
bad,"You work constantly. If they can work you, they will. If you ask for a day off for something, forget it. Minimum wage. No raises. Don’t think I’m a angry exworker because I still work there, 2 years later. Until I find something else."
bad,"It's an ok place just not for me. The managers at the time were very rude and uncaring or appreciative for your hard work,and job well done. I would work at this place again because of a little change of management."
bad,The benefits aren't comparable to other retail stores. They tell you to stay late to finish your duties but then you get spoken to if you go over in payroll.
bad,"When I was at Dollar General there were lapses in authority. Our Store Manager got promoted to district manager which left a hole in our infrastructure with an even bigger hole in authority. Instead of promoting the assistant manage to store manager, they promoted another person to assistant manager. Two store managers, with completely different methods and priorities. This went on for the majority of the time I worked there. Numerous accounts, that were never reported, of harassment towards employees. People quitting on the spot. Ridiculous demands of time management during a minor four hour called-in shift. Expectations exceeded possibilities to the fullest extent."
bad,It was a good job to get work hours in. Very stressfull environment. The upper management was very unorganized and they didn't pay their workers enough to have quality workers. I learned how to fix the machinery. I learned how to deal with difficult customers and make them happy before they left the store. It was a very busy location and we didn't have enough staff to cover the floor. My favorite part of the job was interacting with the customers.
bad,"Right after I started the manger was let go, and there was no manger for most of the time I was employed there. The others employed just kind of did whatever they wanted. It was a mess."
bad,"The hardest part of this job was being able to satisfy the customer since the policy's were on a what bests fits the customer. Instead of having a solid policy and stand by it, you adjusted as you went. Which made it difficult since not every Lead/Management did the same thing. You tend to get a lot of customers who want to scam you."
bad,there is no work home life balance you work all the time and the company does not care about associates or management. even when it is a security risk. the customer is alaways right even when it is a viaolation of company policies
bad,"It wasn't the greatest work experience I have had. The hours were over what you said could work. They didnt take into consideration that you have other obligations. The customers were great, the management needs some work."
bad,My manager didn't even teach my anything when I became a lead sales associate. The higher ups also don't care about conflicts if interest. They say that its all about teamwork but then they will push everything on the coloring shift so they get blamed for the work that the morning shift didn't want to do.
bad,"I enjoy the flow of meeting new people, working with some friendly coworkers. I've learned that in retail it will no always be the best of the best but you get use to working stressful shifts. The hardest part is if you have poor management, and that makes it hard to enjoy the labor you put out for the store."
bad,Manager did nothing associates did everything. The manager was not professional at all would leave to go home down the road an leave associates to run the store. When being new that isn't so comfortable.
bad,Not willing to work with your schedule. Expectations are extremely high for only having a few hours to complete a long list of tasks. Management has threatened to make it so I couldn't get another retail job for no reason other than applying for other jobs.
bad,"When i first started there, everything was great. The manager and the whole team were very friendly and actually cared about each other, it was a very fun place to work. We were family. Within the first year, i got a promotion to keyholder. But half way through the second, things began to change. The DMs began cutting our hours and demanding more work be done. When the truck wasn't fully stocked and the store wasn't 100% recovered we got in trouble. But 118 hours or less for 2 full time employees and 4 part time is not enough. and that's not counting the manager. She was working 60 and 70 hour weeks and coming in at 5 and 6 O'clock in the morning just to get the truck stocked, Managers are supposed to get one day off a week, she hardly got one every 2 or 3 weeks. Finally she quit and was replaced with a poor excuse of a manager who doesn't care about anyone but himself. If you ask for 1 personal day off well over 2 weeks prior, he will agree but when the time comes he schedules you to work and refuses to change the schedule. And the schedules are not set, we don't work only Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Every week is different and we don't know when we will work until a day or 2 before the week begins."
bad,"I worked for dollar general for over a year. The manager I worked for showed favoritism towards other employees. The manager never worked.  The employees were expected to do everything. And for the company as a whole, we don’t get benefits. Besides a coupon for 20% off certain products that we get once a year around Christmas. The company could care less about their employees. You only get holiday pay for Thanksgiving. Everything else is not considered a holiday apparently. I worked long and hard for that company. And got showed zero appreciation in return. Only after working there a full year, I got a 25 cent raise. You start out at minimum wage (7.25). Dollar General is a terrible workplace. I will keep doing everything I can to prevent people from having the same experience as I did."
bad,"A typical day at work is walking into work and relieving the morning shift, recovering/stocking the store and helping the cashier, closing the store and counting the deposit at the end of the work day. While working at Dollar General, I learned that the corporation does not care about their employees very much. The management in my store was horrible, nothing was done the right way and no one was treated equally by the manager. The hardest part of the job is getting your point across to other co workers that they need to do their jobs the right way without sounding rude. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be helping the customers."
bad,"There's not a lot I can say good about working for Dollar General. It was a retail job, I ran a cash register and put up stock. The hours were terrible and the manager changed schedules without a warning. No benefits for regular employees and barely above minimum wage pay rates."
bad,"Dollar General in Carterville IL is okay. The employees are awesome. Working there sometimes could be challenging, other times its pretty fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job is the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is when u have little to no customers so that u can complete your duties for the day."
bad,"I worked for this company for just under a year and I have to say that the only reason I enjoyed this job was because of the people I worked with at my particular store. District Management was no help to us at all, my store manager struggled a lot and never got the help she needed, which in turn, affected all of us at our location. I did learn a lot about management, I was hoping to obtain the assistant store manager position, but never did. Once the store manager left that I was hired by, I was under the impression that I was going to be the new store manager, but they brought in another person from out of town to take the job. I never was offered any advancement and went above and beyond at work. I spent 40+ hours a week there and came in when others called out, I did my job well and never got recognition for any of it."
bad,"When I worked at Dollar General, there was always only 2 employees working during each shift. As an employee there, I had to stock shelves, tend to the cash register, build displays, clean up and also pay close attention to everyone that came in the store. I felt like I was the only one working and the managers had the easy jobs. I feel like I was over worked for $8 an hour."
bad,Management is nearly impossible to contact when needed. I had to travel to three stores to get the hours I needed for a 40 hour work week. They give nearly no training and expected me to know how to accomplish what needed to be completed on a daily basis.
bad,"The typical day at Dollar General involves two people doing the work of five people as best they can. The only up side is even cashiers learn manager skills because they have to since the stores are always understaffed. "
bad,Too much to do no hours for associates. Most of work expected to be done by salaried management. Feel we are set up for failure. Hard yo recruit associates for low pay and no hours
bad,I do not think the pay is the right amount what so ever/ it was very hard to work from pay check to paycheck without much of a paycheck. Overall the working experience was not good at all.
bad,"dollar General was not a good place to work for. on top of the little hours and low wages, they expected me to do everything like i was security. because of all of the thieves, i feared my life working here."
bad,"No benefits,poor security, break times are missed policy's are not followed  one person is left to run a shift by self for more than one hour the computer systems is out of date cameras are being turned out of range by bosses and training is not being handled the proper way over all needs more help"
bad,I don’t want to give a review on this company because it’s been so long since I have worked here. I didn’t enjoy working for this company but if you are needing part time work this is a great option.
bad,"A typical work day is you come in and usually whoever is working always acts like your in trouble and act like they don't like you even though you did nothing wrong. For my job position I was required to learn a various number of things but everyone was too lazy to teach me and they would try to hand it off too someone else. The new store manager that was just hired is very nice and is the first person to try and teach me things but meanwhile he is also trying to learn himself.The workplace has too much tension and there is a group of people that talk to each other but if they don't like you they talk about you behind your back. The hardest part of my job was working with the people that talk about you behind your back. The most enjoyable part about my job was connecting and talking with customers helping them with any questions they had, and also the lunch breaks so i could get out of there for awhile."
bad,Employees are taken advantage of. Good hardworking employees are passed up when a promotion spot becomes available for an employee that neither has the experience or desire for the position.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working here. I had a very sour keyholder that I worked with. Always mad and never smiled or greeted the customers. My manager was unorganized and kept the store a mess. The daily tasks were okay just restock, rotate items, unstock stock room, reset planograms, clean and run register. The pay was upsetting and I could only work under 25 hours making minimum wage. I did this while in college so it was kind of convenient. I would not recommend long term employment here or the hassle of a key holder position. You get a slight pay raise with more workload that gets delegated to the cashiers."
bad,the store is not staffed for the level of work and you are expected to have all your store stocked and straight daily. average work day is 10 - 12 hours and only 1 off day a week for low pay. This has been worst mistake of my life.
bad,"very stressful days sometimes very long hrs. on  registers no breaks, out of 5 Key holders closing 3 nights because no one else wanted to do it or be bothered with the customers either if I worked weekends I would close 6 nights straight closing."
bad,"Their computer systems are not up to date, you need a manager almost every five minutes for a void. The customer crowds are normally poor and rude. Shoplifter galore. Feels unsafe."
bad,Worked all the time found myself being put in situation I didn't enjoy like being left at the store alone. Working at the store not getting paid for it. The should job is a joke.
bad,Company is not employee oriented at all. I would not suggest working here if you are family oriented. store managers are set up for failure in many aspects.
bad,"This job can only be a second job they dont give enough hours, low salary if you plan to work in here to survive look something else. You can't pay rent, bills, and food with that salary."
bad,The job can be high demanding but its an okay job for a college student. depends on who your managers are on how your hours will go the shifts vary you always have to be on call. pay is minuim wage.
bad,You are in the warehouse more than you are at home. Good money but never enough time to spend it.  Have to kiss butt to advance in the company. Supervisors sit in their office and monitor your production and write you up if you aren't cutting it.
bad,"Worse case scenario as far as retail goes. Mandatory 6 days a week, salaried position, and absolutely no work/life balance. Managers are thrust into hopeless situations with no help provided."
bad,They cannot keep anyone. Besides managers I was the longest working employee they had had in forever. My first manager was a great guy and I would recommend anyone work for him but when he left the place went down hill. Some management just sat on their butts and expected employees to do everything themselves. Only one person could be on register at a time and you were expected to work stock at one end of the store but get yelled at for not being at the register timely enough. All together just don’t work there!
bad,"I loved my job here as a cashier! I loved my customers and my co-workers. However, the manager I had was a poor choice. I always offered to work other shifts if I was needed. My son got sick for 2 days and has heart and kidney problems, I informed my manager and even had my shifts covered. She got upset and texted me my ""new"" schedule. She had purposely cut me to 4 hours when I normally got anywhere from 36-50 hours!"
bad,"Going into work, the first thing to greet you are roaches on the floor, management couldn't perform the simplest tasks which slowed the work flow down tremendously, and overall a very unprofessional and very stressful work day. The most enjoyable part of the work day are the customers and making their day enjoyable."
bad,When I worked there I saw four different managers. There was only two that were awesome. I got moved up to key holder and got put in charge of a couple people who didn't respect my position so I did their jobs and mine but my boss screamed at me in front of customers for forgetting to sweep one night.
bad,"Too many new hires too fast, which cuts back on hours available for previous new hires.  Went from 30 hrs to 8 hrs in 1 month.  Better management is essential."
bad,"micro management "
bad,District managers and store manager suck. They do not care about anyone but themselves. The customers are great. The managers need to watch customers stealing rather then staff. Managers at the store level do not work at all anf are not smart enough to be managers.
bad,It was hot. The customers are rude. Doesn't take care of their employees. Store manager is an amazing person to work for but the district manager is a horrible person
bad,There was not a good sense of team work. Hard work from specific employees goes unnoticed.Management was poor and there is very little conflict resolution
bad,"High hopes I had for growth and advance, but 2 1/2 months and the passion has been beaten out of me."
bad,"The manager was always all over the place and truly needed more help within the store. and when she was the store manager I never received a break. I loved working with people and helping the customers everyday, I didn't mind stocking the store constantly needed to be stocked and in which since no one else did it I did all the time everyday. Also with no trainees when the manager was suppose to train them they didn't so on my work I was the one who helped the new employee because we would be left up front pretty much the whole entire time I worked for your company."
bad,You come in the a mess and have to balance your job while finishing someone else job. You have to try and help everyone at the same time because your manger on duty does nothing but walks around the store
bad,Any and all parts of management are rude. Part time people do NOT get paid for working holidays but are required too. It takes forever to get any type of raise. Management thinks they are better than anyone else. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for the company. They try any way the can to save money and not have to pay you.
bad,Not a great place ..   to work.  No respect.. the manager is horrible.. please don't work there.  They hire the worst employee s .. they are lazy...mmm
bad,"very stressful, management was not fair at times, I worked as the cashier 95% of the time at a busy store and the other employess would rarely help me, but this job helped me with dealing with customer service"
bad,"Hardly any hours per week. Store manager was involved just enough to keep her job. Minimum wage, Zero benefits. Schedule was all over the place. One day I would open, the next day I would close"
bad,I don't think my experience necessarily reflects how all the stores are. I worked in a small town where the employees had cliques and were already destined to be rude.
bad,the place was nice until you see that they don't care about the employees life.they care about their store and product. they expect cashiers to get 6 totes done while on register which is understandable on a non busy day or if tote has little bit of product.
bad,"I learned how to become a leader and how to engage with some rather difficult people both with staff and clients "
bad,"I learned about patience (especially around Christmas). A typical day was busy around lunch time, and had dead periods where most work was done. Management was sometimes easy to work with. The culture was diverse, but some employees should have been terminated quickly. The hardest part was trying to cash/ help customers out when it was truck day. Management frowned upon a ""lazy"" worker. The most enjoyable was getting close to regular customers and trying to make someones day better."
bad,"This was the worst job I have had. Went through 4 managers in my time there and I would only say two did their job correctly, and both of them didn't stay long. I would not suggest working for Dollar General unless you are in desperate need of a job. You may get lucky and get a good crew, but upper management does not support your store unless it is a successful one, which is hard to maintain depending on where you live and the people running the store."
bad,"Yes dollar general has great prices, but in oder to maintain those low prices they treat they're employees like dirt and barley pay them. They expect you to do the job of 3 people yourself on minimum wage. I don't care to work hard, but pay me what I deserve and treat me like a human being."
bad,"Very low hours , the management isint good gor the store but somehow it has a great team of workers with an very good wprking environment. For work .  ."
bad,"This is not a long term place of employment by any means. this place is not considerate of their employees in any way. they are a terrible place to work unless you are desperate like i was at first. i had worked there for a year and did everything above and beyond policy and expectation and i ended up training 2 of my bosses that had just been hired on. they play favorites and its not work based, its who can brown-nose the best."
bad,worked 12-16 hour days.  No labor. poor upper management. would not recommend this company if you plan to build on your experience.  The turnover in management and team level is very high.
bad,Manager and up suck at customer service and how to treat there employees. The only enjoyable part of this job is the customers and that is pretty bad to say but it is so true.
bad,great place to not work if you have a family and don't want to have a life and be treated like a nobody. If you need time off for your family forget about it they will threaten your job.
bad,"Working for Dollar General was great when I was working with who hired me. After that person left, however, things went downhill quickly. I was not allowed to take over the store manager's position even though it was his recommendation that I do before he left."
bad,Love the customers but the store manager isn't the best and shouldn't be a store manager. She does way to much that shouldn't be allowed. When I was hired I was promised they'd work with my schedule that has yet to happen.
bad,"Fast  environment, meeting, greeting customers making sure that their shopping experience was a pleasant one, checking them out correctly and quickly. keeping store clean and presentable.  I enjoy making people smile, you have to learn to handle the good customers and the unhappy ones. Hardest part of the job is probably when we are very busy and I stand at the register for several hours without a break."
bad,"Dollar General is a company with great potential but they cannot control their stores inventory, theft, shrink, and advancement.  Our store had so much shrink due to inventory shipments and a freight room that was overstocked with merchandise that would not sell.  Overall the job was not terrible but do not expect a advancement with the company."
bad,Dollar general is a over all good starting job. I would not recommend it being our main job. The store I worked for refused to allow me to breast pump even tho it stated in the employee handbook it was promited. I was refused bathroom breaks at times and was sexually assaulted. There was one case that my 5 month old son was in the hospital and I had ask to leave and the GM told me there's nothing I could do so I needed to stay and work till close as I was suppose to.
bad,Customer service based job with customers of all ages. Must be able to run a cash register and greet customers as they enter the door. Needs to have the ability to stay calm during high volume points and to be patient with disgruntled customers.
bad,"I was a lead key holder, I was set up in a scam by another employee. DG fired all employees and bought in all new management.  The employees were great. Recovery every night. Great products, great sales."
bad,I absolutely hated working here. I only did it because I needed a job. The management was awful. The store was kept in an organized manner. The hours we're constantly changing. We were asked to work unreasonable hours because of other employees. It was a mess.
bad,The hardest job was being the only cashier in a new huge Dollar general. I was also new to the job. My manager was somewhat helpful and coworkers helped when they could. The most enjoyable part of the job were some customers that frequented the store and were very sweet and made my job easier.
bad,During my time here I have come to find out that this company is very unprofessional and greedy. They pay their workers the lowest amount allowed by law. They also try to make two people run the entire store in an attempt to maximize their profit while breaking their employees back and not rewarding them for their hard work.
bad,Would still be there if they would have only worked with me. Was ok till they thought I was a robot. I worked at dollar general for almost 10 years.
bad,I feel working here is a terrible idea. I brought my complaints to my district manager and he used my name when discussing it with my store manager instead of just saying he heard from a few employees. A typical work day includes running your register and doing parts of truck that require you to be away from the register for more than 30 minutes at a time and you are unable to have a bell at your register for customers to alert you of their presence.
bad,"horrible! pay sucks, hours are scattered, manager was rude and unprofessional. the liked the job but disliked the manager and the pay. overall it was an easy job"
bad,Worked through a temp agency . Supposed to be hired permanent after 90 days . Myself and three others were let go on day 89 without any reason at all . Showed up on time every day and did job without any complaints from anyone at all .
bad,"Okay place"
bad,I have not been impressed with the warehouse at Dollar General. You can never do enough for them and they preach safety only to cover their self WHEN SOMEONE gets hurt. There are much better places to work than here. You will get sick of this place fast.
bad,"Management is a terrible human, Lines all the way back to the store one - two people working unless its thursday then they have ONE person on register and everyone else stocking the shelves. TERRIBLE"
bad,Dollar General was my first job and it taught me responsibility. I learned how to communicate with customers and help them as best I can. But I felt like I was not properly trained on everything i needed to know before they left me on my own.
bad,"There is no security for the employees whatsoever. As a manager, I had customers threatening me all day, everyday. Had customers make threats against me and my job, false accusations. Luckily security cameras were on my side as management and corporate was not. Had a drunk guy angrily follow me home after not letting him in when the store was closed and corporate gave him a $10 gift card. Pay isn't worth anything you have to deal with."
bad,"I would not recommend working at Dollar General. The work/life balance is just non-existent and if you complain about anything they simply cut your hours drastically until you either quit or they find a reason to fire you. They don't want you getting a second job, but don't want to give you money to support yourself either, but expect everything from you."
bad,"Manager was very ugly to her employees.  But nice to her ones she favored . I liked the job when I started but manager said I was not fast enough cut me off the schedule and when I did  go back after a week,  was told I only had four hours for the whole week,  then changed it to two. Or I could just turn my things in and leave.I was not impressed  at all at 5he dollar general  I worked at here I'm Doyline.  Like I said my manager was very ugly to me most of the time,  said my attitude was ok but too slow for everything she expected  of me. When I did ask for help I just got critsized for my efferts. A typical day of work could sometimes be frustrating. Overall I liked the job and wanted to b keep it but manager 2ss so cruel. Taking care of 5he customer wss good, as far as the work environment, very stressful. I learned  I enjoy meeting  people and helping them."
bad,When I first started at Dollar General we had people that loved to help you out if you needed the help. Eventually everyone started quiting we became short handed. But now I fully understand no one ever was appreciated for working for dollar general.
bad,"I liked working there. Because I love having a job. Working there  I learned how to deal with people & how to identify that there's a time & place for everything. As far as co-workers go, I tried to stay to myself, because they all were talking about each other & I didn't feel comfortable in that type of work environment. Even the managers were doing the same thing & i felt like that wasn't right & kept it to myself. The most enjoyable part is helping people & getting the satisfaction from that."
bad,They need a better Direct Manager that actually does his job. And not go by he say she say. also better management in the store and organization.
bad,"Working here consist of, but not limited to assisting customers at checkout and finding items, restocking merchandise, cleaning store. Management and co workers didn't make me feel much of helped. Things got overwhelming. The hardest part of the job was trying to please management. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and finding that we relate in differ of ways."
bad,"dollar general overall is a good company, but the environment is not to friendly and could be alot better, not alot of employees want to help others out which make for a hostile work environment"
bad,"Disorganization, low pay, unwilling to hire to effective do the job needed around the building. Nothing ever really is completed just held until you move it again."
bad,I have been with dollar general since August 2015 till present. I have yet to receive a weekly scheduled. I always have to call the night before to see if I work the next day. When you ask off for family functions / doctor appts. they get very upset.
bad,"If I had to choose a reason that my job is good it would be the fact that they work with my busy schedule. Since I have been here things have been very unorganized however, I love the people that i work with."
bad,"I was told I would have to be let go if I had a doctor note saying I couldnt do something because I was pregent. Either no job or lose my child, after that they look for so many reason to fire me, I made a mistake with my shift leader right behind me and got fired for it."
bad,This is a company that does not value family.  Get to work at 6am and work until 6pm (at the earliest). Their training program needs to be longer than 2 weeks for Store Managers.  The hardest part of the job is being required to work 6 days a week when Managers are putting in 80 hours long before the 6th day.
bad,"To be honest, this is the worst company I have ever worked for in my 24 years of working. They don't pay you enough for all the jobs you have to be responsible for."
bad,"You get your schedule week by week and you never know how many hours you will work."
bad,Was in manager in training and the training was the pits. Working at this place was the last place i would choose if i knew the reality.
bad,It could be a fun place to work if the company would change a few things. Like a little more time off for the manager and a little better pay.
bad,"I got payed only 7.25 with 14 hours on average a week, I worked very hard while at work, coworkers were okay,but management was awful."
bad,I really liked the job but the management was terrible.  You would get in trouble for things you did not do. The pay was not worth it for all the work that was expected of you to do!
bad,On a typical day management seemed to dictate the entire team and only want to control their employees opposed to making it a family like environment and focusing on making the store better as a whole.
bad,They don't give very many hours and very little pay. They neglect their customers by having the people working register stocking shelves and not waiting on the customers
bad,"As an asm I am treated like a cashier, I'm not allowed to car about my associates or their feelings, only for the store managers feeling for when he/she had issues/problems.  Didn't know what I was in for.... horrible upper management, DM does not care about the little people also very hard to get in contact with him/her, lots of work for very little pay, horrible scheduling, very unorganized, not structured."
bad,"Managers are only interested in their bonuses and could care less about their employees. When upper management tells the store manager to cut employees hours this happens almost immediately."
bad,the store was so unorganized that it was difficult to stock shelves. i was suppose to complete the training on the computer before I could close the store but did not.
bad,not stabilized. I was only put on weekend schedule to satisfy the older employer needs to get off during the day and have their weekends while I always worked night and mainly on weekends and not working during the week
bad,"Too much expected of employees. No customer service available. Broken promises of advancement. Constant changes too labor intense for no reason. "
bad,"This job was a good opportunity for me as it was close to home and I had no previous experience. although these were advantages, I did not enjoy working here. the management did not care about the sales associates, they dumped all of their work on those below them and there was much more  expected to get done in little time while tending to the customers. There were no benefits unless you worked full time, and I worked full time hours the whole time that I worked there, but they did not change my status. I was given false hope with being promoted every time that I mentioned finding another job. Then when I finally left they offered me the position. Hopefully other stores of this company are better."
bad,they expect you to be in multiple parts of the store at the same time. even if you do a good job it is not good enough. Not sure how one is supposed to stock in the back and work register at the same time efficiently definitely during the busy seasons. there is healthcare but if your hours are cut your looking at $5 a week
bad,"don't mind everything other than stocking/ great place to learn and use customer service skills, keeping everything cleaned up , stocking shelves, meeting customers"
bad,"I worked at Dollar General for 9 months. I was 18 years old and had a lot of job experience. I worked 2 jobs during that time and they wanted me to quick my other job that paid a lot more to be more available so I could work there all the time. I told them that my max amount would be 30 hours a week because of my other job. It was like that in the beginning but then I got bumped up to 40 hours a week and coming in to do double shifts. In 9 months we went through 3 different store managers; I was just a sales associate. But the new manager when I quit was rude and hateful. She would punish the employees if we needed a day off even for a doctors appointment. The next week she would put us down to do double shifts and then come in at 4 AM on a weekend to do truck shipment. The lady was ridiculous; I worked so much there that I kept having reoccurring injuries in my foot because of it. I was only paid $7.25 but with all of the job duties I was having to do nightly it should have been $8. After 4pm I would be working the register by myself, have to go get carts outside when we were out, clean the bathrooms, dust mop the entire store, and then mop all while the store was still open! When I finally quit and went to my new job the manager kept texting me and being creepy asking about what department I was in and what my tasks I would be doing. I had to end up blocking her number because she kept texting me so much Never will work for the company again."
bad,"A typical day at work was always hectic and rushed."
bad,"Cash handling, stocking shelves, Inventory, cleaned store, inbound calls."
bad,Dollar General does not keep managers or employees due to upper management not being professional. This is not a hard Job you just have to be willing to be dedicated and put fourth effort.
bad,Your work days can range from 10 hours to an entire day depending on the mood of my particular area manager.  I have never worked any place where I was treated so poorly and unprofessionally. I loved my employees they were great and I knew my customers because it was a small town I lived in I hated to leave them but just could not take the way the company treated the management.
bad,dollar general is a horrible unorganized company. constantly changing managers and district managers. so much theft that goes on in the store. no security to help while we put ourself at risk
bad,"-only minim wage job"
bad,"To many tasks, not enough hours or people to do them. They added store hours and did not include additional pay. Went against promises they had made managers."
bad,"A typical day would be cashier and unload toats and or bolts. What I learned from working there would be an example of how I wouldnt want my business a reflection of that. Management was okay for the most part but as long as the managers received their daily 38+ hours a week they would treat you as if they dont care about the employees benefits. My co workers was was descent , never actually worked with any of them , simply because there was one cashier on one shift until the next shift. Actually there was no hard part of the job everything was simple once youve learned the store.The most enjoyable part of the job is when i am clocking out."
bad,"After spending some time with this company I cannot suggest to anyone that they seek employment here. You work no less than 50/hrs a week. You are required to open and close several times per week, so you are unable to form a functional sleep cycle. You will be robbed on a regular basis. No matter what you do there is no such thing as being done with work. This business is run on a culture of you do what they say or you are fired. Know that this occupation is by far the worst life decision I have ever made."
bad,"Never know what was expected from me. Repremanded for other person's comments without knowing what really happened during events."
bad,"Spend most of my time trying to catch shoplifters. The closing shift is great because you have a very set routine to get things done in a specific time frame. Unfortunately, the opening crew will always leave a mess or unfinished projects for the night team. (My team)"
bad,Working at Dollar General Market wasn't as bad as my rating shows. Customers made my job every exciting and interesting.
bad,"This company has its ups and downs.  The job itself I love, the upper management I do not.  I work at least sixty hours if not more a week, and I am a salaried manager.  There is no sick pay or holiday pay for salary managers."
bad,"I enjoyed the customers. Management left much to be desired. The manager closed one night a week and works the rest days, not really leaving any room for anyone else to work days. If you have a family DG not is an ideal place to work, lots of long nights."
bad,"Not organized, management is all over the place, no communication at all..."
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for almost six months. I went to work every day wanting to quit by the end of the night. I was there longer than most of the average employees. I now understand why they go through so many people. It's a very high volume, fast-paced store with barely any security. I always felt scared at night knowing the security level of the building. I was constantly at work because of their long hours and lack of staff. I never had time to do anything for myself. I use to travel almost an hour to work every day, six and seven days a week for eight hour shifts. The pay wasn't great and I was constantly staying well over four hours after my shifts on a daily basis w/ no overtime pay. The manager was the laziest person I've ever met in my entire life. He always had either us cashiers doing his work or his assistant doing it. He played clean up more than anything. He was entirely disrespectful making comments about my weight and even leaving me in the store unattended. Time and time again I reported it to our district manager who is just as useless as he was. She is DEFINITELY in the wrong field. I've known retail all my life working with my Mom, who has worked it all of her life as well. And all I can say for the company is that they're a sorry bunch of people. They never did anything right and as a cashier they want you to do so much for almost nothing. The theft also in the store was RIDICULOUS and yet there is barely any security in the store and Dollar General doesn't care about the customers stealing, just the employees. So from the jump, you're NOT TRUSTED"
bad,management lies to get higher performance then never follows through with promises. Will leave employees alone in the store sometimes all day. Work you from open to close with no breaks. 
bad,"Everyday was different at Dollar General.  You have a 7 day work flow.  Truck Day, Stock day 1, Stock Day 2, Backstock day. Scan Inventoy Outs Day, Planogram Day, Cycle Counts Day.  Dollar General had basic retail values that you carry from company to company...  My co-workers were awesome.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of respect and support from upper mgt.  The most enjoyable part was the people."
bad,Had to stock in between ringing up customers. They were never happy with the work anyone had done.
bad,"During my time at Dollar General I learned that they were set in their ways of doing business and not willing to adapt to changes that could improve business. Customer service was not the priority, and the management team was not expected to do nearly as much as they should. Management required to spend most time coloring charts and not improving store."
bad,"I didnt feel safe, nor where the managers fair, it was the worst job ever."
bad,"The day consist of counting your register, before opening, checking out customers, stockng cleaning."
bad,"This was a good First Job. I worked with the schdule that was given to me and made it there in time to do the task that where assigned to me that day. Most time working Cashier and while no one was availble to cash out, then i stayed near work station to unload work boxes on to shelfs. Some days i was required to front shelfs and fold clothing sections."
bad,A typical day at work as a store manager for Dollar General involves working your rearend off trying to obtain the results set by corporate pencil pushers. It is almost impossible to obtain these results when they only allow 1 cashier and 1 manager per shift. The manager has to be on the sales floor working but is constantly interupted by the cashier who needs the manager perform a function on the register which requires managers key. Usually the opening manager is in the store for the first 4 hours by themself which means not a whole gets done since you have to stay at the front of the store. A store manager is suppose to work 50 hrs a week but most including myself work 65-70 hrs per week just to to get everything corporate wants done taken care of. The pay is horrible for the hours worked. Dollar General prides itself on making family first but I rarely saw any of my family durimg my years with the company.
bad,"When you walk in the door for your shift, you better be ready to hit the ground running and be like that until the end of your shift. Upper Management, and Corporate expectations are exceedingly overwhelming. Managers work well over their 50 hours that they are required, and still can't complete all tasks. When Dollar General needs to save some money they cut the associate hours, which makes it nearly impossible to get the job done, and meet expectations. Physically,the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck, but the amount of paperwork, daily, weekly and monthly tasks sent down from Corporate was very difficult to keep up with. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and maintaining good relations with our repeat customers."
bad,"Recognition for all your Good efforts goes by with a blind eye, but one slight mess up goes noticed not only to you but all the customers that may be present."
bad,"I have found Dollar General to be an extremely negative working environment where employees are constantly threatened with loss of employment or reduction in hours by punitive managers. Never ANY positive feedback. The employee's rights and needs are second or third after the ""needs"" of the store."
bad,"15 per hour for all lead sales associates  & 13 per hour for sales associates would be fair but that would be too much to ask a thriving Business. Reconsider for People that risk so much like family time, personal time & to the ones that over extend themselves."
bad,Management wasn't very good and hard to get other co-workers to show up to work on time; sometimes at all. I wasn't paid enough for the work I did was expected to do.
bad,Mgmt required to work six day a week. Pay needs to be better. Company is growing at a very fast rate and in constantly looking for employees to run their stores
bad,Not sure about other dollar general stores. But the one I was at was horrible. I wouldn’t suggest for anyone to go there. Very unprofessional. Unorganized. Short staffed.
bad,"Everything was great in the beginning, until you become a manager.  Unrealistic expectations, constantly being put down even if you come in with a bright, positive attitude, being wrong no matter what, and being told how easily you can be replaced.  This all being related to how my store manager treated me.  Customers loved how friendly I was and talked very highly about me to my store manager, only for my store manager to put me down in front of the customers while I was standing right there.  You will be under-appreciated no matter how great of a worker you are.  Do not waste your time with Dollar General, unless you want to be underpaid, never good enough, or overall feel as if you're worthless."
bad,"My typical work day at dollar general was assisting customers, running register, and putting away merchandise. The work place was very dirty and quite disgusting. Dust and dirt was everywhere as well as bugs. Management was terrible. They barely showed up on time and didnt really appreciate hard work other employees were doing."
bad,"Store management : extremely long hours, work nights, weekends, and holidays.  Store manager have to work extremely physically to merchandise most of truck. "
bad,"I've been having a lot of problems with disrespectful managers and poor treatment the whole time I've been here, they just dont know how to run their business.."
bad,Upper management was generally rude and asked for impossible tasks to be done with no help what so ever. The people being hired were terrible help and never wanted to learn how to do their job. Overall the experience was horrible.
bad,"Cashiering here was a bit hectic. If you weren't manning the register you were fixing displays or restocking constantly since the only other employee in the entire store was either a keyholder or a manager filing paperwork. Due to location it was always busy and not in a good neighborhood. The occasional blackout, flooding, that time a murder happened next door, didn't stop you from being called in. Clocking in was wonky and you would often miss a few hours off of your paycheck if you didn't keep the receipt of it. I was often asked to stay late or come in early with no warning and the manager felt unreliable. I was unsure how coworkers could have another job due to being called in whenever. There were a lot of stupid rules like not being able to check the prices of things on the register even though there a button for it and checking once was enough for upper management to launch an investigation on you. There were no health benefits and it felt dead end."
bad,The company cares nothing for you. You will work 70 hours a week. Over five years they have trimmed payroll every year and added even 14 hours of work each week. DG fresh delivery is a joke that has created more work and huge loss of profit.
bad,"I'd have to say the way the company operates is Comfortless. They claim for you to work for 48hrs this is NOT possible since the workload is high, and lose managers at a high rate because of pay. Pay is low for the amount of work that needs to be done, employees are unreliable. There is more to say but I'll leave here. Overall it is an inorganic company at best."
bad,Depends on what your store manager is like. But overall company wants to make employees get 300 hours of work within a 40 hours. Can't go beyond that or there will be consequences to you or store manager. customers are generally stupid. Company would rather pay disgruntled customers off with gift cards to keep business than actually pay employees.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here. There are too many tasks required for the amount of pay you receive. You go home feeling like you were run over by a semi. Your feet and back will hurt so bad. Sometimes you need a full day off in between shifts.  full day in between shifts just to lye down and rest your body up. Bending, reaching, stretching,"
bad,"I do not feel as if dollar general gave me the tools I needed to carve a future "
bad,I believe it’s the ppl who are running it. The company is great in my eyes but the ppl make me never want to work there again how they took my job away from me.
bad,"Let me start by saying that I am a current key holder who is soon to be promoted to an assistant manager. This place bad, nonsensical, and backwards. From the ground up you're expected to do EVERYTHING besides turn a key if you're not a key holder, you'll get paid minimum wage (7.25) and unless you kiss butt you wont be promoted. As for keyholders, you poor people; do the managers job for minimum pay(8.50) . Assistant managers are used and treated like managers without the pay (10.62). Then managers are over worked and treated like  slaves by district and regional managers on a low yet decent salary. It's horrible but it's what you make of it your team can be fun but it doesn't change their policies or the customers you meet which believe they are the second coming of jesus christ. It's all a joke but the employees arent the ones laughing."
bad,"Pay is for someone who is in high school and has no bills to pay. Also, management is horrible. There are also a lot of managers who like to micro manage everything. Also the company cares more about money than its employees."
bad,Dollar general does not see employees as family. Rather replaceable at any given time. For any reason they seem fit. Very money driven and not supportive of their employees or their stores as a whole. They care about appearance and profit over the health and well being of their employees. It is rather quite sad. They will work 2 good employees into the ground rather than send any kind of help or support system.
bad,"In my experience at Dollar General I was always having my hours cut due to payroll not allowing me anymore time. There was one week that I made $12; that’s right, even though I was available to work any time during the week and on weekends, I was only scheduled one day and then sent home an hour and a half into my shift because there wasn’t enough money to pay me for anything more."
bad,"You have to pay close attention to other employees especially the higher ups. If you have an issue and take it to your boss, the experience I had there was they don't care !  They would rather keep the ones that are stealing and not doing their jobs rather than try keeping an employee that actually works and cares."
bad,Hard worker never recognized for the good things you do always know the bad thing you have done. Really not sure if the td knows how the dm treats the store manager. Rd are pretty good about reconization.
bad,"People I worked with and customers were great, but management was terrible.  Its been a while since working there, so there could be a whole new set up."
bad,"No life and work balance at all. You work 60-70 hours a week, one day off, sometimes none. No help, no support, no processes. A store operates with no help."
bad,"In my  Area a asm starts at $10. I got the to go up to 11 but the sm cut my hours to the  Minimum so it didn't make a difference.  There is way too much favoritism in this company instead of just promoting those who actually work I was even told by my store manager one day that she is not going to work herself to the bone everyone else has to because she wasn't gonna do it "
bad,Manager wouldn’t have the schedule posted until two sometimes three days into that work week. You couldn’t plan anything cause she would call and say you’re scheduled in with less than 24 hours notice and sometimes you’d be getting ready to go in to work and she would call and say No don’t come in you are off come in such and such day
bad,It’a an Aright job for a Start. But I wouldn’t be there more than 5-6 months because the Service and Cleanliness was Horrible. The pay is To Low for the Workers there and Thats why I left.
bad,Everyone wants to be paid 15.00 but don’t want to do the work !! Manager didn’t enforce the rules & the store was chaotic . We had stock 2-3 months ago still not put out !!! The back room had additional stock that wasn’t even processed .
bad,I loved my work and working withh my customers and i loved my job and always worked hard at improving every day. Hours were cut to only 2 days per week.
bad,"They do not drug test unless they're suspicious. I was hired with a promise of 15 hrs/week and never got more than 7-8. I was written up because I had to take my 11 month old son to the hospital and had to call off. Was fired because I couldnt go in becaus I had food poisoning. The manager at OC store was a bully. Always talked behind your back to other employees. Many times I was scheduled for 5 hours but was forced to take a 1.5 hrs break sometimes.  You HAD to clock out at 10, even if you had to stay until 11, even 12. Never got paid for anytime you stayed after 10pm.The amount of work you have to do versus the pay is ridiculous, laughable and unacceptable. I would NEVER reccomend someone to work for DG. You will not get a raise unless promoted, which hardly happens."
bad,Lots of Work to do with very few hours offered. Full time position s exist fore management only. No benefits. No accountability. High employee turn-over.
bad,Its a great place to work if you're just looking for a extra money. Do not dare make it your primary source of income. You will be disappointed. Yes you do advance fast in this company but that only means more work with less pay.
bad,"Stores are often so understaffed that Store Managers have to work 7 days a week to keep on top of projects, on hands, truck deliveries or to just have staff in the store. Mandated to work at least 48 hours a week however, you often end up working 7. Associates under you are not allowed overtime nor do they typically get many hours."
bad,Management is horrible. You can't advance in the company. They give you little hours to work. Management just doesn't care about anything.  They don't help you at all.
bad,"It’s a very disorganized company that go through district managers and regional managers quick. Always in the dark about things, nothing gets fixed in a timely manner, stores get left behind, nobody listens to suggestions, getting talked at instead of talked to, it’s a mentally draining environment. There was a time where I looked forward to going to work but now I dread it."
bad,"Not 1 manager is consistent with company policy. Returns from store to store vary, some throw away returned items and others reshelf them. How are employees to learn what it right when the manager doesn't even follow policy"
bad,"Stock shelves, clean, customer relations. Usually only one person running an entire store. The customer is always right and you will have to override a price so the customers remain happy."
bad,"Got group texted continuously while off. Watched manager and cashier dumpster dive when manager threw cash in trash and envelope in safe. Manager  continuously rude to customers and employees. Manager out of store more than there. I loved the customers and kept store clean. Told DM about coupon fraud,accepting coupons for different sized products,she said they make money from them"
bad,"VERY understaffed. I’m someone who doesn’t mind multitasking, but it’s hard to finish certain task when you have to watch register, stock shelf’s, and pull stuff forward all at the same time within a short amount of hours. Your never praised for doing a good job but as soon as you do something so minuscule that doesn’t meet guidelines, expect to get yelled at. I am currently attending college and due to having to work all the time it’s hard to find time to focus on school and social life. It’s not that we’re understaff because no one wants to work there, we have tons and tons of people asking about jobs there and also applying but the manager won’t hire anyone else."
bad,They'll work you to death. Always under staffed. Promote you because they need a body to fill the position without thoroughly training you. Hours are constantly changing so you have no life other than your job. The pay isn't worth it.
bad,If you look you will notice that all video surveillance is focused on employees while the labor percentage allowed is so low that there is simply no labor to control shoplifting as you have strice goals for having truck merchandise processed in unreasonable time frame as well as assisting customers and office work.
bad,The store manager is disorganized and barely does her work. She disappears on a regular basis and abandon her cashiers at the register even when there is a line up of customers. She doesnt order enough product for the store and doesnt manage the time well. She leaves everything till last minute and then excepts everyone but herself to rush to play catch up. She never answers her phone when emplotees need to reach her. And often fails to call them back at all.
bad,"My manager was a liar, backstabber and played people against each other. "
bad,I've worked at dollar general in two locations neither one was a good experience. Pay is way low and they have way to high of expectations. I've also had to work completely alone many times and always told upper management I was uncomfortable with that. They didn't care.
bad,"They put too much on one person to run an entire store solely while not paying enough. As a manager you are a lot of the times in charge of doing paperwork, stocking, running register, doing deposits, checking in merchandise, inventory, etc while being the only employee on shift."
bad,This job was very hard work for the minimal pay received.   As an assistant manager I was doing the job of the store manager and with no help at all and expected to finish most job tasks.
bad,"i had a fantastic boss for two years. we became fast friends, she understood my mental health issues (extreme anxiety) and would allow me to take breaks to calm down if i got overwhelmed, or would even send me home if she knew i needed to be done for the day. she was great with giving me the days off that i needed off, and most of the time if i wanted a specific day off that wasn't for a medical reason, family affair, and just for my personal gain, she would grant me that day off so long as there was someone that would be able to work that day. i was without a car for a while so i could only work certain shifts during certain time frames and she was very flexible and accepting of that and never scheduled me for impossible shifts. she gave me lists of things she wanted done, but told me which ones were priority and to do my best, but no pressure if i wasn't able to complete them. these lists usually consisted of two or three big projects (unloading rolltainers / uboats) that she would want done for sure if it was possible, and a few smaller jobs (recovery, sweeping, rearranging the stock room) if i had time for them. unfortunately this boss ended up quitting, so i got a new boss."
bad,"I love seeing all my local customers! Sometimes feels like family. But very poor management. You won’t recieve the same hours or schedule each week, it will be different."
bad,"It was a good place to work,just the management was not as good as I thought it was but I met new friends and great customers. The store is somewhat good"
bad,"Management is horrible, not enough staff per shift to complete required tasks. Training is minimal. Little teamwork, very immature culture. Hostile work environment."
bad,"Corupt Corporation. Money Hungry Ceo's. Employees barely survive. Managers are overworked rest can't get enough hours. If your looking for a 2 day a week, low paying, unsafe environment, stores in shady areas. Then it's for you. Good Luck!"
bad,"schedules are set how managers feel they want them to be, you could work 6am to 2pm or 5pm to 10:30. Not hard job until problems arise within the store"
bad,"They advance you, then cut your hours. They never gave raises. You be stuck at the counter and they say you got nothing done. You could take the managers hours but for some reason the managers cant take yours."
bad,"Position was to be 16-20 hours a week which seemed low but thought I could work two part-time jobs. Received first schedule and only scheduled 4 hour shifts for 2 days (8 hours a week). I'm not sure what individual can pay bills on min wage at just 8 hours a week. After mentioning I needed more hours- I got them.... Scheduled 4 hour shifts 4 days a week. Makes it hard to work a second job when you're scheduled every day for just 4 hours. (Looking at schedule... most every shift is 4-5 hours for all employees so it's not just me). Job isn't bad just no benefits/pay/hours. Often only one person working the entire store (as keyholder- key holders can work alone so less staffing needed to cover the low amount of hours given to the store) or manager picks up insane amount of hours (since salaried employees dont effect payroll hours because 40 hours vs. 80 hrs, salaried employees get the same pay). It's sad that any place works with such few resources available to them because corporate doesn't want to give store the hours needed for proper staffing."
bad,Was told I would be hired in as a manager and wasn't. I was then offered I promotions and 8 raises within 6 months but my DM didnt follow through with any of them.  The last straw was me being transferred an hour from home and was promised a raise to help cover gas but no raise was given.
bad,The hardest part on the job was communication and also keeping up with the register when someone else on the job wouldn't do it. Management was difficult to communicate with for important reasons as in asking for help as my first experience as a sales associate
bad,Everyday was a new mystery of finding what was not done by your coworkers and how long til it’s forced into your already lopsided daily load. Favoritisms played a big role and thePay is not worthy of work load.
bad,I worked here for only 5 months and was terminated. I was the only Caucasian person employed there. My manager was untrustworthy. She constantly said one thing and turned around and did something entirely different. I was working for minimum wage and doing almost every except for unloading the truck because at the time I was working there I had a knee injury. As soon as I left a new manager took over and everything improved.
bad,"The  Mangenment was very lazy,..They wanted you to put your life in danger of someone stealing/or try to steal,...Mangers always on there cell phones talking to family members and friends..and the night before I left the Company, that is  when we (two of my other co-workers got robbed....No head Manger on duty...and when we called them...No answer on there phone."
bad,"Only women work at most stores, shoplifters and robbery are common. Only one person work in the store in the morning unless you are stocking. Not enough men working, the DM only shows up when something is wrong"
bad,Extremely poor management. Clinton Highway store went through at least 6 store managers within 4 months. Key holders and asm are worthless. Do yourself a favor and be a waitress. It's only $3 an hour but it beats working here.
bad,"I have been working at this company for almost 2 months and already can't wait to find another job. Management is rude not only to the customers who I hear complain about him every day I work, but also rude to us who work under him. Management says he has to cut hours for everyone who works there... but himself who is now getting more hours. That I do not like. My paycheck is a steady $171 per week and I can not pay rent, food, electric, babysitting, ect. with this. It is literally an impossible decision between keeping a roof over my children's heads, putting food in their belly's, keeping the electric on for the AC and needing to warm food up or keeping it cold, or needing to quit my job all together so I can watch my kids, but who would pay the bills? I am looking for a job that not only pays more but doesn't give any problems and everyone is treated good and equally."
bad,They slave you then try to make you quit. It's all about numbers and how a store is performing they do not care about their employees at all. If you have a family and in any type of position there its dollar general first family last.
bad,The job is very stressful because you have to do your percentage of 100 percent if you hurt yourself they right you up the bosses never have anything positive to say there always on you to hurry up not everyone works at the same pace but they expect you to work like a robot
bad,The hours constantly change. We are always getting hours cut and that is no way to run a store. That makes the management team has to fill in all those hours. That doesn't give much home time for them. It gets really old when you get a call every other day to cut 2 or 3 hours. It's hard to keep employees if you can't offer them the hours.
bad,"Dollar General stores are individually independent upon what the store brings in. The stores have a spending amount that is given each week for employee hours including management. Even if the store is full of employees, you may not get the hours of more than part-time for each, but due to having fewer employees on the floor the store will suffer from stocking items in a timely matter and may take a whole week to be ready for the next truck. With Dollar General, they also set a minimum limit for how many items must be stocked but sow no regard to those that work the register on how many they should be doing, as with some stores with only one cashier or CSR on the floor, it is really difficult to get away if you happen to work at a high volume of customers in the store."
bad,I originally started here as a cashier. I was promised a manager position as well as good pay. After 3 weeks I was given my keys. After a week of that our assistant store manager was caught stealing and was fired. From there I was promoted to ASM and got moved up to 11$ an hour. Which is great-for a start. I've now been in this position for 3 months with no sign of any raises or any sign of anymore growth. My manager also obviously is trying to set me up as she had another manager from another store close. Badly I might add and now tells me it's my job for the store to be perfect tommorrow for pur DM or I will be demoted
bad,Many times left alone in store for hours. Expected to unload freight per guidelines and wait on customers. If freight not done expect a write up.expected to help. Wsut on customers and do voids and returns while on lunch and off the clock. Could not leave building when you are a lead as it is just you and cashier.
bad,"I loved my manager and thought she was a good person, but for some reason she rather keep one person that was toxic to our ""team"" and lose two employees at one time. I feel like managers don't take into account in what their employees say and causes them to no longer care about their job. It was upsetting to leave but I didn't want to stay especially when my Assistant Manager mistreated me the day I was going to put my two weeks in and just ended up resigning my position."
bad,This company is horrible!!! They do not give raises for your time being there despite saying they will. They expect you to work long hours with barely any vacation time.
bad,"Didn't like my management,  but I loved my people and the customer service is amazing.  I just needed more hours.  I wouldn't recomend it to someone who wants a long term job."
bad,"Corporate MANAGEMENT is  very poor. The only time that they seem to take any interest it seems, is in negativity. Many hours available.  Part time associates under paid"
bad,"Full time means 38 hours a week at most they hate even the risk of overtime. Assistant managers are paid less than associates at other chain stores. And expect to do the work of 6."
bad,"If you just need a job or is a student wanting to earn cash cool. I would not recommend it to somebody who literally has responsibilities. It's interesting at first, but it is not a good career choice."
bad,"It might have been the specific store I was working for, but Dollar General is just a pretty terrible company to work for. They pay you the bare minimum for working 4 jobs at once, let us work in a building fit for demolition, it was just bad."
bad,"Worked very quickly and had plenty to do that part I really enjoyed. I loved my regular customers, and pleased to meet new ones."
bad,"The job wasn't necessarily hard but it was very difficult to get enough hours to pay any bills. Scheduled hours varied week to week, one week being 21 hours, the next being 9. Had to ask to be moved to a different store to obtain more hours and still wasn't enough to make ends meet. There were no available positions to be able to advance and 6 months into the job being written up for not wearing appropriate dress code although it was never brought to attention until an auditor came to evaluate."
bad,"The management at this store was very poor and yelled at the employees on a daily basis. Not good for morale. "
bad,I just had poor management. We were told to do all the managers work while she was high in the bathroom. I would have loved working here but I don’t get paid management wages to do here job.
bad,I work part time and only advancement means working a 10 hr day which I can't do. The pay is the worst and they expect u to work ur butt off for very little pay. They changed our hours for the summer we now open at 7am and close at 11pm and don't feel safe closing with only 2 people in the store and I'm usually at the front by myself U have to work 6 hours to get a break and  U can't leave when ur on ur break in case it gets busy can't wait to leave when u come in or out u get ur purse and bags searched they r always short handed because no one stays long  the equipment u use never works and they don't rush to fix it
bad,"Where to start?!!🤔 Never enough hours given to accommodate the heavy work load of the store. One person takes on the work load of at least three people. One person is cashier, cart pusher, janitor, stocker, vendor receiver, customer service, and if you are key holder money management  We were required to take care of maintenance issues unless they were unfixable without professional help. 2 people expected to work up to a 2,000 plus piece truck in two days each week. HUGE turn over rates due to poor management and pay. I was The store I came from alone turned over at least 25 people including my self in the nearly 11 months I was there. They will work you to the bone and if you get behind you will NOT catch up unless you have a ""work day"".  Quitting was the best decision I could ever have made.  I was overlooked when it came time to be promoted to assistant manager because the new manager hired all the folks that worked for her at ""Family Dollar"". And last but not least, constant threats of disciplinary action if task weren't completed"
bad,"The company itself was unorganized and expected you too bust your butt 24/7. Somedays to finish what they wanted me to do I did not take a break. "
bad,A very fast paced working place. Expected to keep areas clean while trying to keep up with customers. forced to do tasks that may deem unsafe to most other companies.
bad,"If you like cardio and bring worked to death for approx. 4-9 hrs at a time this is a great job. If you enjoy handling angry customers, extreme couponer wannabes, older people and veterans, scanning stuff, and only getting paid minimum wage then this is the perfect job for you! Otherwise, I do not recommend working with DG. Also, you get paid every week, and they don't take it taxes, so if you depend on tax returns, you'll just be real sad."
bad,The store is a broken store the District Manager is awful he don't put in the time with his managers at all. They need some one better and also better payroll.
bad,"Dollar General will work a person to death and not recognize them in any way.  They have no thought of their employees, they are made to feel like they are only there to make the company more money."
bad,Dollar general is a vile place to work and or try to grow in the retail industry... The employees think theyre better than everyone around and as if they don't have jobs to do jut standing around talking because they can get paid for it not cool and it's very depressing to see people so self absorbed and not even into their work or anything productive
bad,"Working there, I really did enjoy. Just wished I had worked in a different location with a better manager. People that normally came in and out were nice and respectful. I really enjoyed the cashier and register part of my job. But unfortunately there is always bad apples in a tree. Lets be honest, the manager would constantly do eye rolls to and in front of the customers, would make disgusted faces at anyone the person didn't like or agreed with, and two out of six co workers were really nice and respectful and considerate of the customers and the other co workers. I just really thought it was a disappointment that a manager that had it pretty good, was so rude to almost everyone. Unless they had knew them from some where or knew them more on a personal level. I wish that job title and that job experience would of been more worth it in the long run."
bad,Under staffed by design. Management received bonuses when payroll was under quota.  Quota was set to where there was never enough people do meet work standards.
bad,"There were several incident that occurred during my employment with Dollar General, all of which ultimately led to my leaving. If I am being honest, the assistant manager was absolutely unbearable and inappropriate. By inappropriate I mean I was told on a handful of different occasions about their drug habits, and they also attempted to encourage me to ""drop acid"". This individual called me on MANY if not most of my days off to come in for them, which led to me finding out after the fact that they were lying a majority of the time about why they had to leave. That is very poor management in my book and not someone I want to have to deal with on a daily basis. The store manager was very friendly and laid back, I did enjoy working with her, however I don't think the incidents that were brought to her knowledge ever actually got handled, which is bothersome considering it lead to at least two employee's leaving within just a few months of the store being open. My manager was very accommodating when it came to schedule changes which was nice. The work itself was not difficult, however if you have any limitations you may want to reconsider, only the manager was considerate of employees who were unable to do certain activities such as lifting heavy items or lifting several heavy items. I was never properly trained, and from what I understand all of the other new hires were in the same boat as I was, if not worse. My training consisted of several online videos, brief training from my assistant manager (which has been inconsistent in the long run) and then I was on my own. Not every"
bad,"Dollar General cannot fill their employee openings (low wages, expensive health ins., rules, rules.) so that leaves the employee's at each store to be totally over burdened. So much so as to cause illness and injuries and heads up, workers comp. doesn't average your wages for the whole year anymore they only use the 6 wks. prior to your injury. Guess how many people that hurts? And guess who it benefits? The Corporations."
bad,"I worked as cashier and I cleaned and ran register and stocked.of you couldn't work if they called you their attitude changed towards you.hired on as full time but lucky to get 20 hours a week and no benefits. "
bad,"Was good job until Store management changed , He knew it all and they ran him off. Store went down hill quickly after that. Corporate needs head examined...."
bad,"Everyday is continually busy with customers.  On top of that, the company expects all job duties to get done in the shift provided. Shifts can vary from 3 to 14 hours. Customers do not matter in comparison to resetting sections, recovery nor stocking products. Management is poor. Managers do not offer nor are they willing to provide their employees with any type of training opportunities outside of the new hire training videos.  They are willing to write up employees for any type of misconduct; however, they are not willing to work with the employee to fix the problem. Managers are more apt to create a hostile work environment versus harmony. Not a place if you want to be able to laugh every once in a while at work.  The company does not even give you the time to breathe. If you call in sick, you will be judged harshly; however, you are expected to come in at the drop of a dime every time you are called, even when it is a requested day off. You are expected to follow company policies as well as the managers rules, even when they go against each other. The customers are the only redeeming quality the Dollar General has, which does not say much for the company."
bad,"I worked here for 2 months as a freshman in college and I hated it! It was my first job. The management sucked! The manager who hired me was fired before I left. The assistant manager took over from there, but I know that she ended up quitting later. I always felt like I had to do 20 things at once. I would constantly get called to the register even if a manager was already up there while I was trying to do other things. The store was also always a mess so recovery was constant"
bad,The store was understaffed and consistently dirty. Managers were being hired and fired monthly to try and get the store under control. It is very slow paced work with little to no career advancement.
bad,"I had issues from day one, manager sexually harassing employees and the DM was worried about firing him bc he’d get Unemployment. Every store I went too had a manager last like a month at a time."
bad,It was okay just didn't get any benefits and the managers were rude and were plotting against each other instead of trying to make the place better and to help it grow as a business n
bad,Management does not care for employees. It was every man for themselves. Never felt part of a team. They expect so much of you with the little training they give and always had favorites.
bad,"During my time with dollar general, I received very little support from upper level management, no direction and encouragement, and the culture was one of belittling and demeaning to it's employees especially those of color."
bad,Unappreciative of the work you do. Very rude and poor management and people skills. When you get hours you are worked to death and get treated poorly by managers including store manager and are expected to drop everything even on days off and are never supposed to have sick days period. Just a hassle and hours changed all the time there it was never the same every week and even when schedule was put out it was no guarantee it would stay that way. Ridiculous write ups for things you was never told when started or was told to do by mod that day to do but sm writes up for it. Never kept enough employees Incase of call ins sometimes people would have to work double shifts.
bad,"When I started, my original manager worked with my schedule and was an amazing boss. After a year of me working there, my boss moved to another store, the lady that replaced him spent all day hanging out with her girlfriend and wasn't doing her job, she also wouldn't work with my school schedule and I am not going to miss school over a job."
bad,Long hours. You never know when you are getting off until the actual time you leave. Heavy lifting. You don't get extra breaks for staying past eight hours.
bad,Loved my co worker but when the robbery happened nobody asked how I was or anything but they asked the other person. The shifts always changed one day they gave me a 7 hour shift and didn’t put me in the schedule for the rest of the week.
bad,It wasnt really a good place to work. No real hours and on top of that pay sucks. There are times where even customers can become very rude and nasty over the little things.
bad,"Managers are REQUIRED to work 6 days a week and most days are at least ten hours and it wasn't unusual to work 12 to 16 hours a day.  High stress, low pay for the hours"
bad,I was promoted twice in 6 months and still made less than a cashier at other retail chains. The management at the store I worked in was lacking in leadership.
bad,"It was  a great workplace,until I needed them,they instead tried to push me out. I did leave the company but i never understood the compassion loss of them all."
bad,"An average day consisted of helping customers at the register, unloading the truck, on truck days, putting up the stock, cleaning the whole store, all with 2 people for the day. Hours were not always the same from day to day. The manager I had only out up stock while she was there and only helped out at the register when I had to go to lunch, she would then leave for the day and have me clean the store at the end of the night by myself. I did not stay there long enough to have a good impression of the company and got another job as soon as I was able to acquire one."
bad,"filty, not enough help, did not hire enough people for the work needing to be done.  Upper management wants you to work full time or longer without getting proper compensation."
bad,"Poor management, they do not give you personal leave for family emergency they will call you in no matter what,no raises where it's needed, store is run awfuk"
bad,Overall I would recommend this for s first job. It was pretty easy we work and not too many hours. The manager is very petty about situations and will not address you but will address everyone as a group. A lot of immaturity.
bad,"Was hired in from temporary job i had helped to move old store to new store was one of 8 hired to stay as a sales associate, was never fully trained on register. i helped customer's, stocked shelves, cleaned, cashier, My manager was in way over her head she was rude alot. loved working with my co workers, nothing hard about the job just stressful over the manager not doing her job well and taking it out on the workers. Enjoyable was working with a great team."
bad,"Dollar General is a place that trys to get the most out of employees which are in now way motivated to do anything, the managment is awful and does almost nothing and it seeps down the ladder onto the employees."
bad,My time at Dollar General wasn't the best. The company often hires people that are hard to work with. Trying to balance the amount of work running a store needs with your life is often hard. Also its stores are often under staffed.
bad,"At Dollar General you are required to constantly strive to maintain a clean and well-stocked store, with little or no support. You can count on never being praised for your work."
bad,Decent pay for store managers but they expect too much from them. They don't give you enough budget for your employees so therefore SM's spend alot of time there alone and fall behind on tasks which is why a majority of DG's are falling apart. They pay minimum wage to their cashier's and not enough to their key holders so it's hard to get anyone hired in or too hard to even keep employees. Their health insurance is awful. They have no sick days and because of the lack of employees there is no one to ever cover a shift if someone can't come in. Their trucks that they send are huge and you never have enough space or time to get all the product on the floor. The corporation and upper management are very unorganized and have very poor communication with their employees. To them it is all about the money and they will run their stores on skeleton crews until they burn out. Their turnover rate is high but that's because they treat you poorly.
bad,"My work experience at Dollar General is a very stressful experience. I have been at this job for less than a year and have gone through 5-6 Store Managers and 3-4 District Managers. With that, all employees had to work extra hours just to fill in the voided areas and to help keep up with the store. Since i have started I have been working full time hours with part-time payment. Management really doesn't treat employees with any kind of real respect. I plan on leaving as soon as I get another job."
bad,the workplace is dirty. boxes and merchandise is in the aisles. merchandise falling off shelves and in places it should not be. it is not a good environment.
bad,There was always inconsistencies within the team. Very poor team management. Very untidy. There was usually alot of drama within the team. The hours were rediculious. There are no benefits working here.
bad,The job requirements for a minimum wage associate outweighed the hourly pay of minimum wage extremely! Most of the registers and handheld equipment didn’t work properly. Management didn’t follow breaks and meal time guidelines for the associates
bad,"As a cashier, you have to be on the register (the ONLY register open, usually) while also sweeping the store, recovering and stocking the shelves, and then deal with angry customers who were offended that you weren't standing at the register waiting for them. There are very high expectations when there are generally only two employees in the store at once. Sometimes, even one person alone."
bad,Depending on your manager you will either be a part of a team or be forced to handle a very large work load individually. There are very irritate customers and very frequently you'll be left with tasks that cannot be successfully completed alone but you are expected to have them done within a few hours. The expectations are unobtainable. The work environment is very dreary and in some instance can be unsettling and dangerous.
bad,most stressful and time consuming job i have ever had. no matter how much i increase this store im never noticed dont feel i have advancement opportunities
bad,The company tends to over work and under pay. The workload seems to overwhelm you at times. Stores are hardly ever organized no matter how hard you work. Most employees treat the job as s paycheck.
bad,The hours were never the same. The upper management were rude to the employees. Back stock rooms are always backed up and they never hire enough people to do the job.
bad,"The are no hard &dry  procedures.  They change  some times  dayly. The company does not allow an amount time to perform the  "
bad,"That job is okay, but the pay isn't. You get $8.25 and are paid weekly, but you barely get enough hours to make 200 dollars a paycheck. You basically have to work the whole store for the hourly pay."
bad,"They pay so little in the area, that they couldn't keep employees. high stress, lots of hours. my district manager seemed like she hated men, which caused little respect for me, without just cause. The store manager was working 20 to 30 actual hours a week, while telling our district manager that she was working 60 hours a week and that she is the only one working hard to make sure that the store is presentable. I'm sure that this isn't a normal practice, just know that my experience here was unfair, a lot of hours, unexpected lost of crew members, and i felt like there was no open door polices. the new store manager was a very nice lady, that seemed generally concerned about the crew and store. she however was a fresh hire for the company."
bad,"It was an okay job at the beginning. I had good hours for some weeks. Then, it turn into just working once a week. Had to get a second job to provide for my son. Manager would not work with my schedule for my second job. No benefits at all. The store was always a mess and had a terrible smell to it. She only gave hours to her favorites"
bad,my first day there they gave me a punch in number that wasnt working yet so i had to use someone elses.. then told me i have a buggy to stock with and run cash register when i have cutomers and that was it.
bad,"Upon entering the store, depending of employees visible, you may get help in finding what you aim for. very few coverage, no more than two registers open . if there is an error in the price of a product, shift supervisor has to arrive to correct error."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of duties and tasks that were almost impossible to complete. I learned to be patient with customers and reasons why they became aggravated. Management was poor and my manager would refuse to work nights even though the requirements were to work at least two night shifts per week."
bad,"upper mgmt wants everything done perfectly & simultaneously, but they want you to prioritize. so when you complete project A, you get reprimanded for not completing project B first. god forbid you fall behind on any projects, then you're really in hot water. overall, just a terrible place to work."
bad,"Six day work week"
bad,"little autonomy in this position, little chance for advancement, very poor work/home life balence. Usually ran store by yourself untill mid day before having lunch. Budgets for payroll are very tight so manager must multitask continuously. Don't ever be sick or injured since there is no help to relieve you."
bad,I HAve no tips on this place I really have nothing at all to say about anyone or anything going on up there. The pay was low and the people who shopped would steal a lot.
bad,"I was promoted very quickly, due in part to the lack of staff. It's your basic run of the mill retail chain store. Get the freight in as quickly as possible. The lack of safety measures. Hours and hours ,no days off. The only thing that kept me their as log as I was their were the customer."
bad,A typical day at work is stocking shelves and running cash register and assisting customers with any questions that they may have about where they can find a specific item.
bad,Uncompassionate company my grandson was dying and I was fired for things I did under extreme stress very bad employee relationships. Horrible upper management
bad,"Good people to work with, however there is much to be desired from upper management. Learned how retail operations are run. Hardest part of the job is unattainable demands from management. Great associates and made some really good friends."
bad,"Too much work for not enough money. Expect to work nights, weekends, and every holiday. One day you work six a.m. To three, the next day you might work three p.m to ten. The computers are from the seventies and don't work half the time."
bad,"maybe just a bad fit for me but I did not enjoy my time at dollar general, if you like the feeling of people looking down on you or always being critical about how you do you job and the manager picking favorites go for it. the job itself is not bad the customers are kind enough and management isn't the worst as long as you don't mind a high school atmosphere."
bad,"On a typical day of work, I would come in and count my money drawer down to 100$ on the dot.  I would then clock in, punch in my password, that I made up, and start to check customers out.  If there aren't any customers in the store at the time, I would go around the store checking to see if anything is out of place, and place it back where it belongs.  Once a customer comes into the store, I would go back to the register and begin to check them out.  Once my shift is complete, I would empty the trash, clean the restrooms, sweep and mop wipe the windows to the freezers down, finish with unfinished carts, and clock out."
bad,Poor management. No schedule posted for the week. No breaks. Store manager is ghetto and always on their cellphone. Rude. Other workers are nice and helpful.
bad,At my job I am responsible for checking in vendors and running the cash registers. There are days that I open and other days i half to close the store. On Tuesday it’s truck day so I half to take care and f stock.
bad,I have learned many things about the company and its stressful half the times. The management is poor and i enjoyed working there sometimes but at times i dont
bad,"Its a okay temporary job. Just not really something id stay at because, managment was currupt and there was not enough employees. Extremely under staffed."
bad,New manager came in started cutting everyones hours she wasnt trained properly. Manager would then go to employees and talk bad about another employee hoping it wouldn't get back to the one they were talking about.  Pay wasn't that great. Loved working there and the customers but has real bad management.
bad,I was hired as a temporary employee and was also part time being that was the only opening they had...I was told I would get anywhere from 25-hours to 3-hours a week. But at the end I was getting about 9 hours spread out over 3-to-4 days...This would not even cover my gas so I quit.
bad,When i worked here. The store manager and a fellow employee used the buddy system. The employee got to do whatever they wanted. While I was over here working ridiculous hours. I had no time for myself. I was working 7 days a week for the last like two months I worked there.
bad,"If you need a job and are able to work for little pay, go ahead and apply for a job at dollar general. to be honest, I'd really only recommend this kind of job to a first time worker, it's always better to continue your education and get a better job out of that rather than just settling for a low paying high effort position like a sales associate."
bad,"I worked at my nearest dollar general in Winter springs, Fl as I had just graduated high scool and was looking for a starter job to last for around 2 years as I would move to Gainesville to pursue a higher education and at first, there was no manager as the previous one had relocated. The overworked assistant manager who was taking care of 1 kid and 2 grandkids has to pick up the slack of the now empty role of manager while still staying assistant manager. I came in as a newbie  but quickly learned the job, as the weeks went by, I quickly learned that the job description for my position meant nothing as being a sales associate meant stocking, cashiering, along with rotating stock. Now while this is somewhat expected, being a new worker It became overwhelming fast as a row of people would gather before you would know it. Due to the location of this Dollar General more a more lower income crowd was attending this place but they are valued customers and will quickly warm up to you. After about 3 months of no manager they finally got a hire from a different store who knew some previous experience of being a manager but never with this crowd of people. She was nice and even handed out gifts and bought food for the holidays but somehow with some coworkers, including me, the connection wasn’t there. As we got into the fall semester I went to a local college to get started with earning my bachelors as the semester went on the manager started to schedule me on days that I had my classes and calling me during school times even though I had specifically stated the times I had school. Around"
bad,It was good for customer service but the way the company itself is I honestly did not like working for them. My pay was never right time never was right it was just an awful
bad,"The management changed a couple times, meaning some managers were better than others . Some of the managers would come in and change everything and make it better, and some would come in and not do anything to help better the store."
bad,Not a company I would ever consider working for again. They believe an employee who was terminated and upset rather than check the facts of what is being told to them.
bad,The management is not right. They put too much responsibilities on the cashiers. They take too many cigarettes breaks. Not all employees are treated fairly. To much drama. Cashiers have to stock do totes an there’s so many u have to do during the day an plus stock beer cigarettes. You straighten up the shelves. Get the carts take your trash an bottles back. Then do other ppls jobs bc others are to busy goofing out or on another cigarette break. You don’t get paid enough to do all the work u have too do.
bad,"Bad experience. I worked hard, and I'm honest, reliable, dependable, good attendance and I was mistreated along with other employees and was terminated for doing what was right."
bad,"This company could care less about their employees. I was hired on part time and ended up working almost full time hours. I worked 7 days straight at one point. There are NO discounts offered except a coupon at Christmas. And not a good coupon. Management at my store was struggling. The store was poorly stocked on account management never received enough hours for sufficient stock time. The amount of customer theft was out of control. The clientele was friendly for the most part (a lot of regulars), but you still had your rude, lazy, “no home training” type of people that shopped there. I have a disability and when corporate said I was slow at stock and cashiering, management failed to have my back and stick up for me or explain my situation to upper management."
bad,Very stressful. A lot of work to get done in a very short time.  No hours for employees making it where you work alone for most of the day. Its difficult to reach someone at the main office to help with register issues.
bad,"Dollar General is a somewhat productive place. It got very chaotic during the weeks of nobody showing up for work constantly, working triple the amount than needed. Other than that it was a fairly good job for someone whose in need of  a rather quick job.  "
bad,"pay was very low for what was expected to do. Money counts never came out right, when i asked managment said was computer problem. "
bad,This job is hard to be at. You are timed in doing everything down to putting items on the self your not asked to go to another store you just told to and to get mileage for the extra time it takes to travel to another store was a fight
bad,I personally worked there for only a month due to getting barely any shifts. I worked maybe two shifts in a span of a month and was only on the clock for about 8 hours.
bad,"Dollar General is a company that is looking for people who they can work today and pay nothing to do it. They have complete disregard for people's lives, and only care that you are coming to work to stock the shelves. Forced to work for up to 12 hours a day sometimes without a lunch break. No A/C in the summer time. Lots of opportunity for advancement, mainly because nobody wants to move up."
bad,"If you're looking for an easy,laid back job...this aint it. You are the janitor,the costumer service rep, the cashier, stocker ,and so much more. The best part of the job is being a cashier because that's pretty simple but the stocking and habing to be 5 places at once isn't easy."
bad,"There was so much negativity and work drama with talking behind each other's backs. Also, I was supposed to make 10 per hour and then all of a sudden I was dropped to 7.75 an hour as a Keyholder..."
bad,I was asked to shave 30 minutes off of every employees time in the morning and at night. As this is illegal I had to find employment elsewhere. When I brought up the unlawful activities I was asked to preform i was locked out of the computer system and demoted.
bad,"You get paid nothing but minimum wage and if you are lucky a 5 cent raise a year. The work is stressful, boring and you are treated less than human by the people who shop there as well as the people who own the company. If you like the sound of that then this is the place for you!"
bad,the job it self was great the customers where awesome. management were all about what would benefit themselves not the company or customers if they had to actually work everyone else was in trouble
bad,The way that managers are treated by Dollar General is very inconsistent. Each manager seems to have different expectations so it is very difficult to feel that your performance is satisfactory
bad,"Constant back/forth to register. Management=unfriendly, Pushes you to your limits & unprofessional. Overworked and underpaid. Management blames others for their personal mistakes. I was only there for short amount of time and left due to horrible management."
bad,"From Dollar General I learned how to greet and interact with customers, practice patience, clean and maintain a store, and had some experience with a register. Usually in the four hour time frame I would go in management could be helpful. My coworker lineups shifted. Communicating with my work was the hardest part. When people smiled from my help that was literally the upside to that job."
bad,"Work long hours without compensation. As Store Manager the expectation is to maintain a loyal and dependable workforce while not having the ability to retain good employees due to inability to remain competitive. If an employee does not show up and no alternate can be reached, the store manager is required to work the shift. The manager is not compensated for the additional hours worked and are often times working 60-70 work week (open-close). Advancement is often promissed but never realized."
bad,"My coworkers were kind, most customers were respectful and kinds, always got to see the sales that were going on in advance and employee discounts and coupons on certain days."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Dollar General at all. The management was very unsatisfactory in my opinion. I was told to perform a task, but not shown how. Later received complaints that the task I performed was not done properly. There was back-stabbing and bad-mouthing behind other employee's backs constantly."
bad,Working at dollar General is a stressful job. Many times you are left for hours by yourself to accomplish tasks makes it impossible.pay scale leaves a lot to be desired. Good management is a plus but they are far and few between
bad,"Was a good first job, but I would never work there again, wouldn't consider this job to anyone unless they needed the job, but poor management and poor customers."
bad,You get no hours to get done what you need and to cover the store.  Sms are required to work any hours that need covered do to lack of dg wanting to allow store coverage at all times.  They set you up for failure.
bad,"I would not recommend working for Dollar general, terrible work place. No place for anyone to work. Management is horrible they promise everything and do nothing!"
bad,Dollar General expects  a handful of people to work on a limited number of hours and get a large list of things completed. Which if everybody was trained and familiar with everything it would be ok but workers are constantly changing and the few people that know the job are not able to do everything. What is not done by the workers falls on the managers. DG does not care how many hours a manager puts in as long as the store is where it needs to be.
bad,"Allows people to do horrible Couponing, even employees do so, Promised advancement that never happens. Constantly cutting hours and even a part time cashier may only get 4-10 hours a week. Managers hardly care what their employees are doing and most employees are so stressed that their attitudes become lacking. Very evident that most employee's do not wish to be there at any given time."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General was being given a list of tasks to complete while also interacting with customers and covering register if need be. Though a lot could get done during your shift, you would likely be told it was not enough and the store would not be caught up completely. There was little compensation for the amount of work you have to put in."
bad,Simply put dollar general is not the worst place to look for and who knows If you get lucky you might be moved up (doubtful) i know from first hand experience that hard work and effort do not pay out as the company would rather hire someone with previous management experience to be a store manager makes sense right? wrong i was trained for over a year to be a store manager but when my store manager was wrongfully terminated they hired some random woman off the street who had only ever been an assistant manager at a fast food chain. Fast food and retail are totally different things and that is why the current store manager is failing i had store manager position temporarily as they searched for a new one and during that time the store had never looked better customer reviews were amazing sales were even more amazing but low and behold i didn't get it. They now wonder why the store is tanking.
bad,don't pay enough for assistant store manager for all the work and things they have to deal with. even when your previous manager take a leave and you run the store never gives you opportunity to get store manager position
bad,"i really dont have anything to say about this company.  the job was parttime withno benefits low pay, worked you to the max.  I feel the store structure.is prone to theft due to stretching the staff too thin.  The management has no local control over sales and merchandising.  Its all done from a central location, one that doesnt understand the liocal people or the economy."
bad,"DM can be a pain. Same w/micro-manager of an SM. ASMs are usually good since they're in the same boat as you. Not a good fit unless you like to be on your feet for long periods. People can be nice though more often than not, they're jerks and can be rude."
bad,If you would like to be treated poorly don’t expect a lot of money and be worked like there’s no tomorrow this is the place to go to other than that if you want minimum-wage part time and stress still a place to go
bad,"The company does not value employees or customers. The moment your hired at minimum wage your sent memos about internal theft that you must sign that pretty much accuses you of stealing.The cashiers are viewed as disposable equipment with little value. That would explain the terrible customer service, high turnover, and deplorable store conditions. Worst retail job I have ever had and I've been in retail 20 yrs."
bad,"The atmosphere here was toxic at best.  In my short time here, I witnessed a coworker with no training thrown into an interim managers position, and made to sink or swim.  They want you to multitask the entire store, while keeping up with the register, keep the whole store clean neat and tidy, and keep the backroom clean, all while maintaining a smile on your face. I personally got a right up for ""not being enthusiastic"""
bad,"There was no way of advancing in this job. Although they swear up and down they are a great company. They pay was not too good. The ""high ups"" were always a drag and ""better than thou"""
bad,"You work long hours, you have no life outside of Dollar General. The pay is good but job is VERY stressful. Management SUCKS, District Manager doesn't care about your safety or your personal life. The only thing that's good is the pay and that you get paid weekly."
bad,Working for Dollar General is good for a secondary job because the pay is never enough to cover bills. I have experienced good managers with this company and I also had one that was clinically psychotic. She is the reason that I left the company. I did not feel safe around her.
bad,poor management and the store is high in theft the store manger never really wanted to work or he would wait till last min to get something done and try to cram it into one work day
bad,"DM's: you will work 60 hrs a week, EVERY week"
bad,typical day included ringing people up and restocking merchandise and keeping on eye on customers as they were known to lift merc. I learned that even nice people steal sometimes if they can get away with it. management was racist and cold and rude one may have been a drug addict...culture is what youd expect not much. Hardest part of the job was not standing around as they expected me to walk around the store to deter theft but I was A CASHIER!!!
bad,A typical day at work would be working the register and helping customers. Stocking and fixing shelves was also involved. I learned better ppl skills and better customer service. On the other hand management was terrible. The hardest part about working there was dealing with the rude and difficult manager. Other than that working with my other colleagues was enjoyable.
bad,They were horrible to comply with you. They asked what days you could work and so you told them and they proceeded to give you exactly what you COULDN'T do. and then when you said something they agreed to work with you. only to schedule you the complete opposite again. Sometimes you had to call in to check your schedule because they wouldn't have it out in a timely manner. overall this dollar general was a horrible place to work and if you have kids its even worse since you need a baby sitter and don't have a reliable schedule.
bad,Random work hours that were never consistent. Work here if it's your only option / you really need money. You only work with one person at a time that being your manager so you don't really get to make connections with anyone and it's overall pretty meh.
bad,"Regardless of what is good for employees, they expect you to work 80+ hours  a week even when they said you wouldn't work more than 40 per week when hired. They run a VERY small crew so that you can never get caught up no matter how hard you try and customers are rarely happy."
bad,Most store managers I worked with where not good at their job. the company over all treats employees poorly and pays poorly. I worked for dollar general on and off for 6 years. I will never go back.
bad,"When I first started working at Dollar General I did not mind the awful working conditions because I had wonderful coworkers, but that quickly changed when new management arrived. EVERYONE that originally worked there, including myself, (if not fired) had to quit due to the horrendous and cut-throat working environment set by the new store manager. Within 5 months everyone who had previously worked there was gone. The turn over rate was awful and from what I have heard still is. It is hard enough to work in retail, especially when the company you work for is like a mini Wal-Mart, but if you must work in a place like Dollar General make sure the people you work for is at least a decent human being."
bad,I enjoyed some of the customers. Some of the people I had to work with acted ten times younger than their age. Im glad I did quit dollar general. Im happier.
bad,Dollar General can be relaxing if you have the mind set to not let the management and customers worry you. Its cool if you really don't want to go anywhere else in life
bad,Lack of training and inability to assist when problems occurred with staff.  Bottom dollar main focus and not employee driven. Poor pay with unlimited dedication required.
bad,This is just a job to get by. There are no special perks for working for this company. A pro is that checks come weekly and because there is always short staff there is always room for advancement.
bad,Turn-over is high for many positions. Management doesn't seem to hold up to high standards. There is not a team work effort. It's every man for himself.
bad,My typical day at Dollar General was busy easing going had my regular customer's that comes in often. I learned a lot about customer service and how people like to feel in when they in come in  and shop. Management was ok I don't think she took me serious i was just a favor I feel like I could've been treated better in fairness when it came to my schedule it was hard trying to survive of 4 hours two three days out the week I feel like this is a job for teens older people or someone who just need a part time to kill time.There wasn't really any workplace culture. The job wasnt really hard at all. The best thing I got out of my experience from Dollar General where the people I met my coworkers.
bad,Work life balance is horrible with the company working 80 hours a week to meet expectations for the role with unattainable goals and expectations. Additionally expected to be available 24/7 via email or cell phone. The company narrative regarding taking care of people and providing opportunities is lip service.
bad,Wages are horrible for what is expected of you. Manager is lazy and only works days. Customer service is not good at all when you are expected to be away form the register all the time to stock and clean.
bad,"i love dollar general store. work can be okay at times, love the regular customers. seems corporate requires you focus more on the store/freight what about the customers."
bad,"Over Worked and unappropriated. Not enough staff, bottom line for this company is Money, they do not care for or about anything else. I wish I had the support I needed because I would still be there. I was so stressed out from the thieves, the call-in's, never having enough staff to receive trucks, or fill the shelves and corporate just flat out not caring. I had to resign. To save my life, my health was being compromised, so I left."
bad,"If you don't have a family depending on you for stability, want to be at work fron 3 in tge afternoon till 11 or 12 midnight then this is the job for you. It's not enough money for living and definitely not enough for the amount of work they want you to do."
bad,"At the time I was hired the store was on a skeleton crew of just management with management from other stores filling in. This location could not keep employees. There was a turnover of 8 other employees until I finally quit when asked fro a bathroom break from the register and was denied because they had ""lost"" the key sevedral days before."
bad,The district Manager. Raberto is very nasty and rude and instead of getting tge alarm system at the door. He rather change lights and have the employees put their life in danger
bad,i work hard but the pay is not worth it with all the things that they want you to do in so little time i like the place and people but i have a family to take care of and working at the store is not helping me only taking me down
bad,"i really enjoyed working there, until the DM was changed, before him we had a great store and an awesome team, until management got terminated even though we were the best store in the district and region, cleanest store in California."
bad,The staff wasn't friendly and the schedule was at times a but unorthodox but for the most part everyone worked hard and for things done. Truck night was by far the best part
bad,"The work it's self isn't hard but the management at the one in Monroe, WI is terrible. Plain disrespectful. They don't keep you updated. They will schedule you a day off. Then change it to benift their needs and demands."
bad,"A typical day working at Dollar General as a cashier was planning on staying later than scheduled time, work area not clean, stocking and working cash register, and always leaving customers satisfied."
bad,"Is a great store, but to work in not at all what i had expected. I felt like i was being taking advantage of, and doing two other peoples job and the managers job as well."
bad,A lot of favoritism no direction everyone wants to be the boss. No one takes responsibility for what they did or didn't do including the store manager.
bad,Any person would need to experience the job for themselves. The store was very busy and high theft. No security on site. The bathrooms went down and everyone had to use a port a potty.
bad,I worked for this company for about a year. Hours were good at the time. I don't believe this company really cares about their employees. I did have a good manager but once she was gone it was over.
bad,Dollar General can be a ok place to work. It's great for kids out of high school to gain experience. It's a fast pace place and lots of work to do....
bad,"I did not like this job. the manager is rude, and is loosing her mind. She would tell me to do something then turn around and tell me she didn't say that. she is seriously crazy."
bad,"This should just be a high school or college kids job. The pay is horrible, benefits/perks nonexistent. Even the management position is not something I would covet."
bad,"Not a horrible place for someone who first want to work hard or often. Massive favoritism. Insecurity within management. Lazy employees. 8 employees, teamwork within 4."
bad,The first night of work I had no training and the key holder left me by myself and then I still didn't get very good training at all then my hours got cut back things got a little better but still had little register
bad,"When I first started it was all great.. till we changed managers and being their for almost a year, cut my hours. Most companies care if their employees are safe they just want the money so they encourage you to case out danger homeless people."
bad,They work you hard for little pay.  They do not give you the hours you are promised.  They lie to you and stab you in the back. You don't get your breaks half the time.
bad,I've worked at many different places. DG was the worst. No incentive for working minimum wage and management was unreliable at best. I don't recommend it to anyone unless it's their first job. Even going full-time with a promotion isn't worth it because of the hassle. DG only ever works 2 people at a time in their stores no matter how busy it is.
bad,Not highly recommended. No compensation or benefits of any kind except the store manager. No workers. Hiring process could be better
bad,"Did my work then some.  Came in when called repeatedly for filling in.  Gave other employees rides to from work."
bad,"boring job, low pay no goals set in work place. Make you do everything while they sit on their butt and eat. Always had only two workers available."
bad,"This job, in my opinion, is only good if you want to be worked like a mule, then treated poorly for your troubles. Extremely high turnover rate. Plant Director needs to be made to switch positions with general warehouse workers, and then needs fired. RUN AWAY."
bad,Was fine at first till the refused to fix my pay check that they messed up on. asked to be out on part time and was refused. lifting way more than a women should ever have too.
bad,The worst part is when the store Manager was working I had to make sure to watch my register very closely because she knew my password. At the end of the day my register was short when she was there.
bad,Pleasant atmosphere at the some DG But others it was not. Demanding back stabbing bunch will throw you under bus. Hardest part of job was having to stock and help customers while boss complained if you stopped to help customer. Selling cigarettes at a family store.
bad,"I love working with people, I am really out going and very much a team player, but I would love to find a career, not just a job. I am looking for a career with advancement, one where I can also have a balanced schedule of home and work. A typical day at my job involves me counting all the money, taking the deposit to the bank, managing a team of 3-4 people every night, handling customer complaints, answering the phones, recovering the store, putting out the freight, closing the store. The hardest part of my job is managing my team when my authority is constantly being undermined."
bad,"The co-workers were very pleasant to be around. Never had any issues with my team."
bad,"Ok store to work for. My personal manager misled me in my interview, that is why I ended up quitting.  Being open on Holidays also, took me away from my family, something I can not handle well."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of basically running a cash register alone, while trying to unload a truck delivery, stock inventory, change price tags, reset merchandise shelves and assist customers in finding items again, alone. I enjoy hard work and delight in helping customers, However, it is extremely difficult to get assigned tasks completed in a timely manner when you are trying to satisfy the needs of the customers and management alike, once again ALONE!!"
bad,"I do not receive the attention required to train me properly,  I never have a manager around, never have enough staff. i do not receive  enough hours weekly,"
bad,Put up with alot of stuff some of the manager just sit in the back and make the employee do there jobs. Rude DM to. Except alot out of you
bad,Always working around the clock to fulfill job needs while trying to ensure sale continue to grow. watch shrink and hire team to meet goals was very challenging
bad,"Dollar General's corporate policies make life at the bottom of the pecking order next to impossible. Hours are constantly cut while expectations are ever-rising. They limit the stores to only two employees at a time and expect each to do the work of several people. The pay is far too low for the unrealistic amount of work they expect from employees at all levels. The only thing that can make it even remotely bearable is the attitude and likability of the employees at the store level, and that is entirely chance and could fluctuate from store to store. Even then, they make it impossible for a regular cashier to make a living wage."
bad,"Dollar General can be a good place to work if there is a manager that cares about the staff, If there is not a good manager then it is very hard to find good employees"
bad,new manager had no idea what she was doing. got frusterated very easy lashed out very mentally unstable very hard to work in an unsecured enviroment
bad,Dollar General was sheep in wolves clothing. They say everything you want to hear to get you in the door and then it hits you. Not enough hours in the day for all they require of you.
bad,The pay is horrible for the task you are assigned. Co Workers are very friendly. The hardest part of this job I will say is the work schedule you are assigned
bad,to many hours required with very little pay. work home life balance was off.. too much work no home time. company doesnt seem to care much for its team leaders when we are the ones who keep the store running
bad,"The management is horrible. I don't know where they get these people they put as store managers, but none of them I worked for knew half of what they were doing. Even the district management didn't seem to care. The store I worked in, was always a mess because no one could be trained properly or keep employees long enough to get the store cleaned up. Stock EVERY WHERE but on the shelves where it should have been. You couldn't push a single cart down half the aisles for all the boxes of merchandise. For minimum wage they expected one person to do the work of 10. I don't recommend working there unless it has a good management team that actually treat you like you deserve."
bad,Co workers are always calling in. The store is almost always short staffed it really sucked cause that meant working extra shifts for lazy people at minimum wage:/ There are never enough cashiers and sooo many customers.
bad,"Not the best place to work. Employees are not protected. They are disrespected by the managers, customers and workers and it is all ok."
bad,"I finally received a promotion after months of prompting and when it finally happened, I was thrown into a store where I was stalked and harassed and nobody from the upper brass did anything about it despite being fully aware."
bad,"this requires you being stretched thin doing several tasks throughout the store, there are only 2-3 people working a 9 hour shift daily.  There aren't any breaks."
bad,"Low minimum wage."
bad,I went thru 8 managers in 5 yrs!!  Expected too much work in too little time and put customer service last.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers.
bad,"it is a good job for a little while, but pay start low. and you have a lot to do for little pay..................................................."
bad,"I did not like this job at all. It does not matter how hard you work at this job and how fast you stock. The management does not care about the employees working for them. They will bring in new people above you. Even if the managers do not do the same work others do, they are kept on or workers that work less are promoted first. It may have just been this store, but I will never look at going back to this company."
bad,"I want to work with adults who don't spend their days gossiping.  I wan't to work, collect my pay and go home without having to carry my work thoughts with me every single day."
bad,Training needs changed and done consisently. Large turn over and favoritism. No inspection of food and high percentage of selling spoiled food. Large variety of items but large shrinkage due to theft of customers daily.
bad,"So much was expected of me when I signed on, but nothing seemed to be offered in return."
bad,"Dollar General is great, they just didnt have a lot of hours and some of the managers just acted like they really did not want to be there"
bad,I was asked to come and help clean up the store and get it back on track. And to help it stay viable to sign a new lease with the building owners. I did both. Then 911 happened. The stock market fell and quite some managers were let go and all the assistant managers took over by Sept. 20TH. I learned that I do not like retail. You have to look at every customer and employee as a possible shoplifter !!!
bad,"Management at this business does not care about its productivity, workers, or customers. I would work 21 hours every weekend aside from my week job at school and classes. I worked really hard and could never satisfy the customers or make the store look presentable. It was an embarrassment. If I had more people to cover the floor while I ran the register, or a boss who worked, things would have been a lot better."
bad,"Dollar General is a great place to work, the pay is not so great, and the customers and employees are wonderful. the management team doesn't know what they are doing most of the time."
bad,"Checking in vendors, making sure shelves are stocked with proper items, meeting customer needs and assisting with any returns. making sure the store is  clean and appealing at all times."
bad,"When I began working here, I was babysitting at the same time. I was only scheduled to work 5 hours at a time and they would not give me any day shifts on Saturdays. I asked for them and only got one out of the 3 months I worked there. I was bombarded with a ton of chores to do all in a 5 hour time limit. My last day scheduled to work, I had to call in due to family situations and my boss replied, ""We got it!"" and hung up! It was a difficult time for me because I am so use to being in a happy, loving environment instead of a harsh, snoody one."
bad,Enjoyed job compensation could have been better for duties expected. Fun fast paced work  enivorment with great customers and co workers.Wish pay was better would have stayed longer
bad,"A typical day started with a extremely brief talk about what was to be done and we would work on it. I learned that some managers have no idea what goes on in their store and know how to set unrealistic goals for their employees. My fellow co-workers were mostly pleasant to work with. There were a lot complaints, but it did not affect their work. The hardest part of the job was to not correct the lower managers who didn't lead by example. I think I enjoyed the people I worked with the most. They were nice and polite to me when I first started and missed me after I left."
bad,"I turned around 5 stores, yet, I always felt as though I was about to lose my job. My store was broken into 12 times before company installed a roll down gate. That's all it took. 12 middle of the night break ins. All stores are in rough neighborhoods with rough clientele yet you have no back up until after the fact, and then it is all your fault."
bad,Come in to work and get the job done like being told. What I learned is skills for me become a manager. Management wasn't that great. Good co-workers do what they are told. When I first came a manager trying to remember everything. And the enjoyable part I loved my job.
bad,"The job is easy but I received no training was just thrown on a register and was told to start waiting on customers.  The company doesn't care about it's employees.  We were expected to work long hours when the store was short employees, which was often because they loose a lot of employees, sometimes it was 10 to 12 hours.   The stores A/C broke down, I finally quit because temps got into the high 80s, I say this to show the company doesn't care about the stores or employees.  NO BENEFITS."
bad,"the management had the worst attitude everyday. very rude to all customers, never took the time to really help the customers. always yelled at and belittled their employees."
bad,"I only worked for $General for a very short time. Typically I was only scheduled for 8-10 hours per week. Fellow associates were very nice, I just couldn't live on so few hours."
bad,awful! unorganized! And rude employees that say bad things about the customers and those that live in the surrounding community.
bad,low rate of hour there is a friendly environment with te co worker and and managers but if you are a grown person or have responsibility s that not be the gob for you
bad,As with every employer they never have enough help more than likely due to the pay and incentives.  Minimum wage would be ok if they had enough employees on hand to handle the load.
bad,"the balance between work/Home is not there, support needs improvement in regional roles,"
bad,"I would get to work by 6 am and cleaned my store, opened the store, ran the store to the best of what I had. The hours that they gave me for my employees where low where I worked most of the day by myself."
bad,Awesome benefits room for advancement great management team clean store understanding staff all around great enviroment
bad,I enjoyed working because the customers made you feel worthy. As well as I learned a lot of different things that makes a retail store work.
bad,Only allowed limited time to complete unreasonable amount of work.  Management is constantly in fear of loosing job.  No support for underlings.  Will through you under the bus in a heartbeat.
bad,Was more of a harder place to work.  Stay very short of staff. And not getting the right hours. It's was a unorganized environment. Everything had to be rushed to do. And wasn't hiring any employers. It was getting out of hand.
bad,Dollar General was a real learning experience but did not have a future .A manager could only go so far I want to learn more to better myself.  So moved on to Big lots.
bad,"my days was mostly great i got alone with the co-workers even if some had bad attitudes i enjoy having a friendly smile helping my co-workers and costumers enjoy doing my job helping others and completing my job, the hardest thing about the job was to much would be put on you with little hours to have enough people working to get things done like it should be and having some rule costumers at time.being in management was fine it would be better if everyone work as a team and get the job done and don't put everything on a manager,but through it all thank God everything worked out."
bad,"Was hired into the company at one wage then that was reduced by $15,000 by the time I was finished training. Work you to the bone requiring extreme hours and poor upper management. No assistance with HR violations. Overall the experience was dramatically poor. It was so unhealthy it cause Mental health issues. Was under an abusive district manager. No support when situations were reported."
bad,"I felt that way too much was expected of me, especially for the money offered.  I really did love my job, it seemed to just be management at each store that I worked.  It seemed that no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough.I love to stay busy and that was never a problem. Every store I worked at was busy.  Maybe it was just the management. Seems like I was talked down to more than anything. I could elaborate but think I have already made my point. Thank you so much!"
bad,"I worked with Dollar General for 3 months. The co-workers I had were absolutely amazing, and they all has wonderful personalities. A typical day was great until new management took over the franchise I was working for. The manager was stealing money from my drawer and she fired me. A week later the manager was let go for stealing, and I was labelled as ""I quit."""
bad,"As an employee at this company, my typical shift would either be Morning shift or Closing Shift. I would be in charge of the duties that needed to be completed on the floor as well as multitasking with caring for customers and check out. I handle issues that any customer had and tried to sort out any problems that arised. I learned to be more efficient, to be a fast learner, and to allow myself that asking is better than staying quite. My coworkers and I worked well together and I try to compromise so that myself and coworkers can work as a team. The hardest part of my job was management. It was unfair a lot of times but I still managed to carry on and do what was needed to be done. The most enjoyable part is the customers, and coworkers. We knew when to have fun but be serious as well."
bad,"fast paced on a daily basis very stressful"
bad,"Company promises the moon and can not deliver, they will offer you one thing and six months down the road they change policy. Opportunity for growth is a lie."
bad,"Loved the workplace!!!! Hate the pay, management, and cooperate only thinks of themselves!!!!"
bad,the management is horrible. they always throw the blame on someone else and they are also lazy. get whatever days they feel like it. .
bad,"Mismanaged from the upper levels no life balance.  You are not supported by the management team above the store manager.  Hours get cut and you are required to keep increasing standards with less people and less hours.  Unsafe working conditions.  One employee in store is unsafe,"
bad,"Working at dollar general gave me a better chance dealing with sales, inventory, and also boosted my performance with customer service skills."
bad,The most Enjoyable part of the job was the Customers and getting to work along side a few of my favorite co-workers at the time I worked there.
bad,"I've come to realize that this company specializes in hiring people that only want to work certain amounts of hours, with little or no people or professional skills, and have or no ambition about moving up within the company.  The managers are only concerned about getting things done with no regard to an actual time schedule or the difficulty of the job.  The store is always either overheated or crowded.  The containers that have the freight shipped in are in a constant of disrepair and are hazardous at best.  The rules seem to be a joke to most of the management and employees and are broken frequently with no regard to their fellow employees."
bad,Managers give workers bad hours so they will quit. Only good thing that came out of working there was having experience with money handling and customer service.
bad,it's retail in a small box enviorment ..8 days a week and phone rang off the hook.. upper management -- young college punk that had bad attitude. His way -no policy- or the highway .Wouldn't work for them again as long as he is there. .
bad,"The customers are awesome. They are my most enjoyable part of my shift. What I learned working from this store is what not to do in a workplace.The work environment at this store location is very poor. The management does not take its job seriously, leaving the store in complete disarray. The co-workers are ok to work with, but the leadership is poor making the jobs harder to do then should be. The hardest part of the job is trying to do my jobs and others before the end of my shift. Other then the regular customers I have no enjoyable moments with the staff there."
bad,"I have been here well over a year, I was told what a great worker I am and I would be promoted but nothing is happening and this is not my type work that I enjoy. "
bad,"To do the job right there are things that they will never tell you in the hiring process. A typical work day consists of a 12-14hour day, starting at 6am, or earlier 6 sometimes 7 days a week. Store managers rarely get the time for an actual lunch break. You are on the clock 24/7, even if you do manage to take the one day off a week you are allotted. Store Managers are salary, paid for 40 hours a week, but are required by the company to work a minimum of 48... but working just that never happens, as the payroll that you are given to run one of these stores is insanely low, and most of the managers I know, including myself work a typical week of 65+ hrs. The work/life balance at store level doesn't exist here. Stores typically run in constant crisis mode as the tasks we are assigned are almost impossible to achieve in the time frame we are given because most of the management team runs the first half of the day in the stores alone. There is no way to get anything done when you are there alone and trying to run the registers and give the best customer service possible. The hardest part of this job for me is not seeing my family. Going home at the end of the day, and the kids already being in bed, knowing that I will be gone before they even wake in the morning. It's hard feeling like when I left work, nothing I did was good enough and I just have to repeat the same process the next day. The best part of this job is my people. My crew and my loyal customers, who have been there and seen the hardships and stand behind me. Who have seen this company go downhill over the last several"
bad,Management was horrible at Dollar General. Typical work day was very stressful and the co-workers were all back stabbers.
bad,Working at dollar general there is always a lot of work to do such as cleaning stocking register helping customers.
bad,"constant job threat using average sales ticket as performance basis."
bad,"A typical day at work involves me running a register, stocking shelves, checking inventory and recovering shelves. I have learned how to effectively run a register at great speed to manage customers with the utmost politeness, swiftness, and without error."
bad,When I first started working at Dollar General I really enjoyed it. But the more I worked here the less I liked it because my hours were getting cut and it got to the point I didn't have any hours at all.So I had to find me another job.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this second rate, bootleg, excuse for a company to anyone. They have no concept of realistic work expectations, they do not follow through on anything they say and they are constantly looking for a way to screw their employees over (especially the managers). If you enjoy working 10-12 hours 6 days a week, by yourself, with no sick time, getting told youre doing everything wrong but with zero recources to help you fix it then go for it."
bad,"While I was working with Advance Security, I was able to obtain employment status with Dollar General. I took upon the job because they needed a manager and to me it sounded like a good idea. A typical work day was stocking and helping customers. I learned how to work on a Dollar General level. The management was good, I never had to deal with them on a constant basis. My co-workers were very fun, hard working and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hard headed customers. The most enjoyable part was me training to become a manager."
bad,"I was told I'd get week shifts on top of mostly weekends, I worked every weekend without any weekday shifts. I worked from 3pm to closing which was 10pm but we didn't leave until 11pm each night. It was very unsafe feeling because the store I was at had been robbed 3 times."
bad,"Dollar General is poorly managed and seems to constantly be at a shortage of hours for it's employees. The management is very scatterbrained and does things that most of the time do not make sense. My co-workers are pretty lazy, only doing the bare minimum and trying to dump their work load onto others."
bad,"Review shipping requirements, assign associates jobs, make necessary changes when necessary due to FMLA associates leaving suddenly or call outs. "
bad,"It wasn't anything life changing and I knew I wasn't going to work there forever. I learned a lot about how stores run and how to help people. The management was never stable and undermined by the district manager in front of us. It was hard to respect someone who criticized the store manager in front of the other employees. My co-workers were all very nice and easy to get along with. Getting everything done like they wanted everyone to during a shift of five or six hours was hard, but I enjoyed talking to people and being organized enough to help them if needed."
bad,too much drama and too many children running that store... had a drunk for a supervisor and the co workers were very unsocialable
bad,"the job was very easy and ok but the management is not exactly how management should be at all. the assistant manager is not a good manager at all. now the manager is suppose to tell the assistant manager when they're wrong but he did not do his job. when customers complain about the management that should tell the district managers something. the company the way they do the schedule is not how companies should do schedules, they change the schedule every day (at the dollar general im at.)"
bad,If you tried to run the store effectively the associates didn't want to do there jobs of stocking shelves when the weren't running the register. No Team work while I was there.
bad,"I work at night and on the weekends at the Dollar General in Ewing, NJ. The GM is a sarcastic man that ignores customers and belittles employees. He has had many complaints to the DM by employees as well as customers that have spanned over 4 years and he still hasn't had any consequences. Assistant Managers and third keys are switched around and transferred from store to store like musical chairs. The job is pretty easy on a regular day. I've been there almost a year and still only make $8.50 hourly. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with the GM who thinks that everyone is stupid but him."
bad,As a store manager for four years with this company I can say it has its ups and downs which is to be expected.
bad,"Open store at 7:30 am, count drawers for coming crew, prepare bank deposit. Open store for customers with a smile. Inform employees of store sales and event or promotions. Shift change and phone store alert up date. Stock room prepare for truck delivery etc."
bad,what i learned is that most of the stores are unorganized.they need to have more compashion for employees whom get pregnant and put on restrictions regardless of when and how long they worked
bad,"Very unorganized, no core values in place. Overall poor upper management."
bad,Hired and terminated employees
bad,Dollar General seems like it would be a great place to work if they were not so busy cutting employees hours making it impossible to survive
bad,coming in and finding a dirty store to be recovered.
bad,Over all staff was good. Hours were great.but management and the abilitie to more forward was not the greatest
bad,"Management has no support, overworked, with lack of hours to complete company goals. Terrible place to work. Lack of advancement"
bad,It was a good company to work for being i enjoyed meeting new people and it was also stressful to.
bad,Tight Payroll
bad,I ran register and counted till. I stocked shelves and cleaned up. I didn't really learn much new there. Don't remember a whole lot about it.
bad,"I was a assistant manager for the company hired to be a store manager after the holidays. Those past never heard anything was told that i was beyond ready got a great review and a raise. But my store manager was threatened, and turned on me. This company tells you on your first shrink class that 70 percent of its employees are reason for shrink. Being in management i can tell you that they think everyone is stealling they are more concerned with employ theft than outside theft. If you do them favors you nummber one in thier back but the minute you need a favor they are by the books and dont care. I had to quit because they would not let me leave for a family emergency. That was urgent. So they made me choose job or son. But they had no problems letting me work open to close several times because people not showing up. IF you dont believe me think about your local dollar general How much do you see employee turn around Alot im sure.....think twice"
bad,"Dollar General not hourly employee friendly, standards are not easy to meet."
bad,"The company upper management wasn't well put together, they were to relax with there stores. I had people constantly stealing, and it was hard to find good honest workers."
bad,Lots and lots of stocking. Stores are confusing and overcrowded. Work is montonous. Overall attitude is employees are thieves. Way too much inventory not enough organization.
bad,"There is a high come and go rate because of the low pay, the managers can get away with most anything and the company only cares about sales and not the people working for them."
bad,After working here for a while you quickly figure out the downsides and major problems within the company relating the corporate itself and the way the store is ran on it self. You can be the best employee and still get in trouble or written up for the dumbest things or possibly get a finger pointed at you for one slight mistake that can either lead you getting fired by cooperate or getting suspended for a week or two.. I’ve seen many people walk in and out of the door due to the cooperates poor way of giving back to their employees I’ve wanted to walk out so many times but can’t afford to. This job is only for those who are desperate for one for a couple of months but any longer and you’re asking for the worst environment to be in. Everyday is a struggle and you constantly fight over your paycheck and low amount of hours you get within a week. Even if someone gets fired they find ways to even cut your hours more! I’ve never been so disappointed from my paychecks every week and feel like nothing is worth it anymore no matter how hard you try. At this point you might as well not even break and arm and a leg for them.
bad,"I like the fact that I was always busy. The most enjoyable part of the day was putting smiles on the customer's faces. When I ring my customers up, I spark a conversation to get to know them a little better."
bad,"In two weeks they changed the schedule eight times, I went from 36 hours to 26 at one time.  After three days off I came in and worked closing.  It was busy so I didn't check my schedule.  I called the next day and was told I was supposed to be at work, I told them I had a snapshot of schedule I had and they had changed it again."
bad,Management is horrible and nothing gets done about it. Manager at this particular location talks about her employees to the other employees. what kind of manager talks bad about the people helping her store stay open?
bad,Could be a better work environment. Could’ve less stressful. The managers could’ve been a lot more pleasant. They could pay the sales associates better because they are on the frontline to deal with all the craziest things
bad,"This job was one of my least favorite to be at. management was awful, the people were paid so low it was hard to live off the wages. The company is poor and the higher ups don’t make this job any easier."
bad,They fired me cause I was pregnant and they tried saying that was not the reason so they are not a fully family friendly but the work is good so that's all I have to say
bad,"Dollar General: expects a limited amount of workers on any given shift to clean, organize, stock & restock supplies, cashier,  address conflicts or questions, help customers locate items, deter theft, answer phones, check customer's ID; does not give schedule in advance; only gives full time hours to management; does not have security for theft."
bad,I really did enjoy my job but unfortunately the management was horrible and they were not fair in having time off like everyone else or with their pay- which is absolutely ridiculous.
bad,They would always send in these huge trucks and would schedule you little or no help. They expected you to work miracles.  That's  one of the reasons the stores look so bad.
bad,Working here was vert stressful at times because management wouldn't want to help at register when there were very long lines. Other than that very easy job.
bad,I worked for this company for a while and always worked my hardest. Management is more favoritism then hard work. As an employee of some years I felt very unappreciated.
bad,"There were a few people here that were great, mostly people did not do their jobs correctly and then people who did work would have to do twice as much work. Managment was a nightmare ."
bad,"they is disrespect to their employee, and they put you to you hurt yourself. they let you have time your family and they do not will not take care of personal business. They won't let go higher the company but their friends"
bad,"The environment was extremely stressful.  The leadership in my store was held to a high expectation and she always went above and beyond, however when she needed help from other locations, the favors were never returned resulting in our overtime."
bad,Working at DG came with a lot more than expected but in the end I managed to leave with much knowledge that would help in later years. I was shown how to manage not one store but many along with helping open brand new stores in the neighboring towns. Most management was great but there were many ups and downs. I confidently felt that I had learned as much as I could in the years I was there. Along with learning much more about myself as a worker.
bad,The company is a one sided company who needs to pay their employees more for what they deal with and give more full time hours. The amount of work given to management is not worth what you make an hour and the store managers being chosen from outside the company is a bad corporate decision.
bad,"Typical day was about a 6-8 hr shift, usually recovering/cleaning sales floor. Or stocking product. It was very stressful considering the level of work I did was not equal to the level of compensation."
bad,"Wasent the best enviroment"
bad,"Keep looking for  an other job. The job is over demanding. All you get is "
bad,"Hard work, physical, highly stressful, long hours, NO job security."
bad,"I like dollar General but I don't think the manager is fair she get all the hours, everybody get paid kore than me and I only get like 16 hours a week thats not enough hours at all"
bad,Bad management.  Terrible employees. Had to report harassment against a employee. Very stressful. .....................................................
bad,"working for dollar general was probably my worst job . the management didn’t seem to care about anyone but themselves . i was new and was still learning but getting yelled at for the things i didn’t know yet . i was asked to do this and that while they watched and blamed it on age . i ran cash register , unloaded stock , cleaned the store and helped customers walking around while they did little to nothing ."
bad,"I advanced from cashier to assistant manager pretty quick. Unfortunately i had to move to a different store to get the management position because the manager I was under had her ""qlik "" she stayed with. There was no way for me to be more than a cashier under her. Onced moved to the new store, I got the promotion, but the pay was not worth the headache and what I had to do. Most days i had to work anywhere between 2 to 9 hours alone in a big busy store with no breaks."
bad,Location I work for had its ups and downs you deal with rude irritating people constantly everyday. Plus shift managers that set you up for failure. It was the worst 3 months  of my life.
bad,The manager that I worked with was cutting my time short because she didn't like me. Because people was no longer flirting with her. She was always eating products in the store that she didn't pay for it
bad,"It was very hard to balance work and life outside of work. Work was very repetitive and they worked you like a dog, became burnout and over worked. management had favorites and it became very daunting to go to work."
bad,"Enjoyed actual job itself. However, the hours were well over 50 per week, very low compensation,l. Annual reviews were very much on low side on merit increases"
bad,Truth is I have worked for almost 2 years now at dollar general and have been treated unfair several times!! I love working with the public it's the other employees that don't do their jobs like they are supposed to and still get moved right up the chain!! I think that is very unfair to the ones who do work their behinds off!!!
bad,"Its not worth it. If you have anywhere else that will take you, go there. This job is purely meant to be a stepping stone to somewhere bigger. A way to get experience. Management try, I'm sure, and yes there are far worse places to work, but things can go downhill quick. One lazy coworker can ruin it for the rest. If you are a hard worker, expect to be worked harder than the rest with no reward other than some back pats.Experience may very depending on location and manager."
bad,"If you like getting yelled at for things you can't change or fix this is the job for you. They want you to do 100 things in 4 hours but the store manager won't help or give you pointers. Most new people i've seen come in there are not trained or know nothing about retail but are being hired for a knowledgeable position. They throw you in front of a computer for a few days and that's your training and depending on who you're around, it might just cost you your job."
bad,Manager was an admitted bi-polar and on no medication. She used threats of employees being written up to enforce work being done correctly.  No encouraging at management level. The turnover was very high and with that came chaos
bad,"The stores are disorganized.   Management doesn't  care  and they physically work you to death "
bad,Dollar general has no security and people were literally walking out with merchandise without being confronted about it like it was ok. The last manager there was horrible. She ran the store as if she was one of the employees. There were lack of managing skills. There were times the store had to be shut down because of lack of employees because no one wanted to work.
bad,"Non stop, go go go, never done never enough. For the end of one summer and nearly the next absolutely NO air conditioning. Customers would have to leave they were so hot."
bad,A typical day at typical work day could be very fast paced but also very stressfull due to understaffing. I learned to be very fast at my job as a member of mangement to handle Customer complaints and hard situations. The hardest part of my job a dollar general was trying to make sure tasks was completed promptly and on time because we were so understaffed it made it difficult the majoirty of the time. The most wonderful part of the job was meeting new people and customers and also having a good realtionship with most of the associates trying hard to work as a team.
bad,The management was terrible. They barely gave you hours. they made sure to keep everyone part time so they don't have to provide health insurance. they worked you like a dog with hardly no pay.
bad,Loved the small store feel (compared to Meijer or Wal-Mart ). Loved having regular customers that  appreciated the customer service skills that were at our store. Hardest part of the job was getting recognized by corporate  (district manager and regional manager).
bad,It was a good job until it wasn’t. I’m ready to reach out and find something new with way better opportunities. Dollar general was my first job but not my favorite
bad,"Still runs like a fresh company even after years. Turnover rate is high even at the Supervisory level. Pay is good. Insurance is average. Typical ""big box"" distribution politics."
bad,"Change in management and poorly run store was blamed on employees with no access to better the store. Corporate often times came to visit and would not hear out the voices of employees. Fast promotions, but stressful workload."
bad,"It wasn't really a difficult job from the beginning but the tasks assigned to employees became almost impossible to complete. Usually, there are only two workers during the day and at night. There are lists of assignments to complete but is hard to do when customers have to be constantly checked out. When the lines get really long, we have to leave the cashier area and ask for assistance from either a coworker or manager. The whole store is also expected to be clean by the end of the day which is almost never done because of short staff."
bad,Dollar General isn't a bad company to work for as long as you like to be a part time employee. Management wasn't the greatest. Responsibility were a little rediqueless.
bad,"I knew what I was getting into when I took the job, ALL retail is the same, hard work, low pay, no work/life balance. "
bad,"You can ask for minor money as long as you show potential but the management sucks. Store manager have a bad attitude. Nobody wants to work as a team. It’s a fast, “I need a PT job so I’ll work here job” but trying to make it your FT is a big no."
bad,Focus is not on Customers and Employees. Micromanagement everywhere. Nobody allowed to make any decisions. Even the most basic. Individuals are forced to work two levels below their positions.
bad,"Experience is dictated by how good your store manager is. We were always short staffed and expected to do alot outside our job descriptions because of it, and you are expected to fulfill them flawlessly. Despite being told i was ""the best employee they had"" i was routinely under threat of being fired because i made X mistake and it was ""corporate policy"" to terminate because of it. If your desperate for a job/need something to get some experience to put on a resume its a decent job to start out at, but its nothing to make a career out of."
bad,"I worked there for 13 months, had no manager for four of them, and had five separate managers.  There is massive turnover, and for a good reason.  "
bad,Work all day from the time you get up till you go to bed. Constant demands. Poor resources. Unrealistic deadlines. Constantly changing expectations. Expected to work on time off.
bad,"Look, ive worked for dollar general 2 times. Both times were awful experiences. The first time, the manager thought screaming at you infront of customers was okay, and the DM did absolutely nothing to help with that situation. The second time, i went through 3 store managers (theyre still working on getting in the 4th). I ranked up extremely fast, however, no store manager that came in wanted to do things the way i had trained all of my staff to do it. They wouldnt fire people who didnt show up to work, but cut the hours of the ones who did. The DM didnt care about anyone, or how anyone felt about things. Just dont. They dont care, they dont get paid to care. Its just overall a horrible place to work."
bad,The workers can be great but certain people that are higher up tend to treat everyone like garbage. They try to get people to quit and are mad when employees are friends with each other. It doesn’t make sense to me because if people would get along it’d be so much more stress free and enjoyable.
bad,"Minimum wage company, very high roll over of new hires, management hard to get along with make you work over your scheduled shift to put out freight which they order and the warehouse replenishes on a timely manner and we end up with stock rooms overstocked with product we can't sell and eventually goes out of date. Not a very well maintained company at all."
bad,"Working long hours with no time off, no work life balance if you are store manager. Had to cover shifts for call ins, there for you would have to open to close alot"
bad,I like it besides the fact of closing 24/7 and never get over 30 hours.  Things could be a little better but you have that everywhere.  But I like the people I work with and every job is stressful.
bad,"4+ years with DG, Sales Associate,Lead,ASM, to acting manager twice for 2 different stores.Long hours, low pay,working endless doubles.Awful customers"
bad,Low work hours across the board. Full time is not 20 to 30 a week. Company cutting hours. Not a good place to work if you want a living cost based salary position to pay your bills.
bad,"The expectations of your performance doesn't match with the amount of resources given to you to perform. In the end, they'll just terminate you and find someone else to fill in."
bad,I don't understand why dollar General can't seem to find good managers.  I quit bc of a hostile manager that threatened physical harm in front of customers and employees and I'm the one who isn't employable bc of walking out?
bad,The job was time managed and secured throughly with store keys and codes. The more you get a raise the more responsibility comes with the job. there would be times where you are sent to a different store for more hours or to help that other store.
bad,"I had a concern with my Manager, was brought to managers attention with no change. I then took it to our GM and it  went from me to the GM, From the GM to My manager. This caused issues which lead down to me walking away from am job i loved! I tried to fix this with no such luck."
bad,"Simply overwork their employees and for low pay. Expect a lot from the employees, even part time help. Managers and keyholders are expected to run the store alone for up to 6 hours! Dangerous!"
bad,"Really? This company has a decent idea of how things should work,  but there is constant turn over of personnel. I was with the company for over two years and we had three different district managers. The store manager I had could get away with murder. Loved her cigarettes. Said she earned the right to not have to do truck and stock shelves. No consistency or accountability. I lost five days of vacation because  she denied me time off. Fair, huh?"
bad,"They expect much pay such a small wage, it is sad they sell lots of product. Expect cashiers to recover, clean, and put up freight no matter how busy. Asst. Managers do little work spend their time trying to write up cashiers that are overworked and underpaid"
bad,"Dollar general cooperate really need to focus on employee benefits and incentives.... There is no payroll, managers work 50+ hours a week. Even if your fully staffed store managers are required to be there 6 days a week minimum. No holiday pay, sick days and the vacation time is pathetic."
bad,I would go in and before it was time for me to be there they where having me do all kinds of stuff off the clock and not being paid for my time at all. I loved my customer but the management was not very good
bad,i loved working for the company. How the store was ran the one i worked for was awful. the Asst manager was out to get everyone and not doing her job AT ALL. it was always left for someone else to do or to finish . not just me tried to tell DM what was going on and nothing got done about the problem. UNREAL what was going on some people was blinded and fooled big time. i their to work and support my family do a good job and always went above and beyond for them. Just got taking advantage off way to much.
bad,"The company only allows one day off for the GM and the expectation is that they work a minimum of 50 hours a week. "
bad,"a lot of overtime is needed"
bad,"Mgr very sweet. Pay very low. High shoplifting rate. Worked alone most of the time unless closing. When staffing is low, hrs are good. When fully staffed, lucky to get 15 hrs/wk"
bad,"Very unorganized, poorly paid, hours were terrible, forced to come in on days off and days you were sick. Very stressful and never got benefits. Not a very good job."
bad,"OK place to work short term part-time. On any given day, only two people scheduled to pull the load. They pay the lowest possible starting pay as possible, therefor employee turn over is at a very high rate."
bad,"As the assistant manager, I got very little training, I take all the undesirable hours and employees, and get blamed for everyone else’s mistakes, while other people take the credit for all the hard work I do."
bad,District Managers are very rude to you they yell and curse at you like children. Not a good place for someone who cares about their health and wants to actually make it to their and their children’s drs visits
bad,My review about Dollar general is that it is not a good company to work for. They gave away my promotion twice that they promised me to the new employees.
bad,I did love my job the pay was awful an the hours as a full like key holder were more like a manager due to my manager not doing her job everything. Was left on me an my assistant manager. We tried to contact our district manager an she did nothing . I had very minimal training an what I did have was by many different people all telling me different things . I quite due to a write up that my manger knew about the situation an played off to the district manager that she didn’t know an all it was .. was her throwing me under the bus to keep from getting in trouble her self .
bad,"The pay is abysmal and very lacking for all the work and long hours you are expected to endure with not enough help. Management tries but they are inexperienced as well. No money, no benefits, no overtime. Toxic environment."
bad,this is good if you just need extra cash through the week but not for a career based job. not enough hours and they could pay their mplyees a hire pay since even mcdonalds start their employee at a hire rate.
bad,I really didn't like working at the store I was in. I didn't like the manager and there was no training to become a manager. I was just put in the position and my trainer just quit the day I was going to be trained.
bad,In the few years I worked there we went through so many store managers because no one would stay. Same with employees. I worked there for four years and saw the entire crew change over several times.
bad,"If you get repack it’s not bad, other than one of the supervisors I had. Constantly move people to different departments with no fair rotation. Promised 4 10 hour days but it’s leave when you’re finished and even then if you know a different department you get moved to it, so typically 4 12 hour shifts with OT on Friday. Management makes it known that you aren’t worth their time and they can replace you. High stress, hard work little pay for the bs that you deal with."
bad,"Current manager for this area has poor management/ people skills, store is always a mess. She’s rude and has no idea how to mange a store let alone employees."
bad,"This company is  doing very well  in terms of profitability. However they do not take a big interest in their employees. Corporate will not give the stores the tools the need to do their job. Work orders pend for months on months and  payroll is a nightmare. Employees are in charge of stocking all shelves in the store, downstocking all the shelves in the store, making the shelves and store presentable, checking in vendors and doing all the janitorial duties   themselves. This does not seem to be that big of a deal but your doing  all of this with two people in the building at a time.... during business  hours. Meaning one person is on the cash register doing nothing but ringing up customers while the other is on the floor. And if there are 3  or more people in line (which is most of the day) the second person is to be the back up cashier. They need to dump more money into payroll  so there is more of an employee presence on the floor and we can do the day to day activities. At least into metro stores."
bad,Assistant manager very rude and unpleasant i couldn't work with her it was so bad. No one liked her and is spoiled and always gets weekends off when the rest of us work way more then she does. Customers were rude and disrespectful. Don't know how to read cupons and advertisements. Regulars were nice. Very busy and stressful always shot staffed and closed early is not enough staff. And certain employess were treated poorly. And the store always looked horrible
bad,I was at this job for a total of 1 year and 11 months. I don’t understand how people have been there for 8-12 years honestly. But the management is awful!!!  Your coworkers yea they’re lying deceiving.Don’t expect anything to be honest. All in all it’s the most awful place I’ve ever worked at. You don’t get hours and you definitely don’t get paid enough for the things you do.
bad,My General Manager made it difficult for a new store manager to succeed. He was always looking out for himself and never willing to coach or help show what would help make the store opperate more effectively.
bad,"Give your job 100% everyday, work yourself to death, still never good enough. point Of sale systems are from the 1980's even in new stores. Company treats all their employees like they are going to steal if no one is watching. Upper management only cares about the dollar, employees from Store Manager down to cashier are all treated poorly by upper management and expect 16 hours of work done in an 8 hour shift. The only upside is the customer base. You meet some great people."
bad,They make their locations an easy target for robbery.. understaffed...then when you're robbed they act like its not a big deal. We didnt have a store manager at the time...the district manager didnt even come.
bad,"I worked there for over a year, went through at least 3 managers within that timeframe, my hours cut more than once, and blame being tossed around to everyone. No matter what you do it is not enough and you bust your butt for nothing. At least in a supervisor or management position it is not worth the pay, hassle, or stress that comes with the job. Part time associate isn't so bad but even then I would not make it a career."
bad,Management was very bad the schedule was never up on time and when it was the manager was always trying to change the schedule but then not inform the employees of these changes complaining to the GM does nothing about these issues. I was fortunate that I only needed this job as part time and would always take a picture of the schedule when it was made so I personally never got a write up for these actions but lots of other employees did until thy also started following suit. Also leads forget about your breaks if you don't remind them so if you have to go to the bathroom you'll be waiting for hours.
bad,My experience with dollar General was very stressful. They did not give us the hours to run the store properly.  We were hired into a store that was dysfunctional and we felt overworked and not appreciated.
bad,"The management asks too much out of people assigning 10 tasks when only 2-3 can be completed, and that is with out customers."
bad,"This Company Isn’t Fair. The DG On 441 In Alachua FL, Is Very Racist On A Sly. My Experience Was Horrible. The Manager Chooses One White Lady Over All"
bad,"upper management do not care about you they just come in to collect checks! employees always call out, they always call you to come in on your day off and will treat you like your nothing if you say no!"
bad,"Dollar General is amazing to work at because of the customers, but the company itself refuses to give out enough hours to cover store fundamentals and such"
bad,"A typical day at work was included running back and forth from the register to cash customers out to running back to the aisle I was working on to continue stocking. It was terrible. I signed up for a stocking position not a cashier position, but I had to do both."
bad,"Good luck having a good solid schedule. Manager changes schedule whenever he feels like, constantly cutting hours. Then when you work your butt off and a few things in the store aren’t done they say you didn’t do anything at all. "
bad,Dollar General is not a pleasant workplace. I'm a cashier and I'm expected to stock even though I can't do it because of customers. The job duties are not handed out evenly. They switch managers around often.The schedule changes at least 2-3 times a week. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,The store in gowns vill did a lot of favoritism and cut my hours down to 4 hours a week and a lot of Childish behavoir nit a good spot to work if you are not liked the manager will perposely give yaskd that can't be completed so she has a reason to fire you
bad,"This is a typical retail job, horrible pay, minimal hours, menial labor. I have heard this company does have great managers at different locations. But this location was lacking that, unfortunately."
bad,"It was a good experience.  The only issue would be the pay.  Unless you are a store manager, you will only make minimum wage or a little above if you are a key holder."
bad,"I went through 9... yes NINE store managers while working there for less than a year. The management quits due to lack of training, poor pay, or working too many hours caused by short staffing."
bad,"My manager wasn't a very good teacher, but she did teach me about self-advocacy and work ethic.  I had to rely on other employees and leave the register to get the manager for the many questions I had on the first few days.  I was mostly at the register, but I did leave it to stock the shelves; however, I had to watch the area for customers waiting to be rung out.  I did enjoy seeing different types of people and occasionally helping them find product."
bad,Company wants managers to work all the time with little help. Often work alone. Some employees only work 4 to 8 jours a week. Full time only get 32 hours.
bad,"This company will slave you if you let them. If your on salary you can expect to work almost every day. Sometimes doubles open to close. Sometimes by yourself. Upper managements response to everything is to just ""get it done"". They dont care how long you have been at work, or how many days you have worked or have had off."
bad,"Although the second time I worked here it was great due to the people I worked with but the pay is really terrible and I wouldn't recommend this unless you're applying for a manager position, but even then you have to work so hard and they only pay you on a fixed annual pay but no overtime. You could work over 84 hours a week and they'll only pay you for 60 hours. And if you're just a part-time sales associate you can't work over 30 hours a week and you're lucky if you even get 20 hours, the highest I ever got was 25 hours. Just all in all a place I would not recommend to work."
bad,"Love the hrs and the time fits my time frame for hrs and around my childs scool time i have the hrs to work."
bad,"I worked there over 7 years ago and although some things may have changed other things have not. The system they use to manage their stores could use a "" looking over""."
bad,"At work you have to put everything that the customers don't want away, clean the bathrooms, broom, mop, tend to customers, fix isles, front all products, and fix candy in front all at the same time before closing. Hardest part of the job is to get everything done in time in the way the manager wants it. In the beginning they will give you a a lot of hours but then when they hire another person your hours will get cut and they will leave you with 12 hours or less."
bad,"no possible advancement, poorly trained management, not enough staff on duty, only 2 registers in most stores, always cluttered, aisles are cluttered with carts and boxes of store items still in boxes. Nothing seems to ever get put out on shelves"
bad,Only two employees on a shift at a time. The store itself was a disaster and all of the assigned tasks were never finished on time. One person is basically doing the work of 5.
bad,"Dollar General DM was very hard to talk to and passed me over for new hires even though I had been there for 6 months. She did not like me and would not let the store manager rehire me, and refused to tell me why or what I had did wrong!"
bad,"Upon my first week working there, my tire was stolen off my car, there is no security and they don't plan on receiving security. I never have my schedule in a reasonable time to make plans for anything. When i do recieve my schedule, it can be changed at anytime, like the day before. There is no stability, and the manager is just all over the place, and the dm only seems to care when she has to get ready for a coroporate visit"
bad,"This company will work you to death for crackers. The training is not viable, They are well known for throwing their people to the wolves, then blaming them for anything that goes astray."
bad,I did not enjoy my job as Assistant Manager. I was treated very unfairly as were the employees i had working with me. I worked 50+ hours/week and it still wasnt enough.
bad,"As assistant store manager I had a lot of responsibility, no insurance, no vacation time and barely made over minimum wage. if you are looking for an entry level job it would be fine but I would not take any position besides cashier."
bad,i loved my job but the 2 i worked for had awful store managers who weren't held accountable for anything they did wrong. if you complained to anyone nothing happened.
bad,"A lot of lifting,bending,standing and walking. Very inconsistent workplace. If need a quick job or experience then work here. Oppurtunity for advancement is okay if you work with the right people."
bad,"Clock in count drawer and get to work is a typical day at the store. Make sure the store is clean! At least the front half if your cashier! Clean bathrooms, and sweep and mop take garbage out and clean your area!"
bad,"Worked with this company shortly and was thrusted into having responsibilities that were not on the job application, such as being given the stores keys and counting the cash registers at the end of every night."
bad,I was the ASM. My SM put majority of her work off on me. Always understaffed and of her times worked the store alone. This company really didn't value it's employees
bad,It goes about as well as you think a job at dollar general would go. At the montrose location there are only ever two people working unless if it is to open but the third leaves before the doors are open. While I was there the manager used that time to sleep in her office.
bad,"1. I liked working there, Just never got days off that i wanted."
bad,Dollar General has a lack of communication with the DM to store manager. Pay is alright for store managers. Dont have competitive pay for sales associates. High turnover rate. Payroll budget is different every week.
bad,Its a very stressful environment with rude managers and not enough people staffed at a time. Half of the equipment doesnt work and corporate wont send new stuff to fix it. They dont pay enough to compensate for all the stress and struggles you have to go through thanks to they're negligence of they're own company.
bad,"It seems like all the senior members were at each other day and night, and made some days very hard to work. Information was lost and work ethic, tame"
bad,"I am a college student and worked here for about 3+ months. The first time I started it was okay, but after a while, things began to take a turn for the worst. The Store and Assistant manager are not the ones who make the workplace overbearing, but the district manager. Work tasks are increasing. Work is becoming more strict and there is only so much we can do since there aren't enough employees on the floor. "
bad,"Minimum wage, “annual raises” (usually not amounting more than $0.25), understaffed and overworked, management problems, very high turnout rate, very little growth within company, no benefits, no overtime."
bad,"When I first started at Dollar General I was told it wasn't an easy place to work, but I shrugged it off. Over time I realized how poorly the store was ran, how much the management didn't care and how large the turnover rate was. "
bad,Only thing I really have to say about Dollar General Distribution it was a good workout cuz it's a fast pace job but on the other hand very dangerous because the training of the equipment that you had to use was very quick and they put you on there without Really seeing how good you were on the equipment
bad,It's an ok job if you have good managers. We went through a lot of managers in the year I was employed. If you have good managers you will be fine. The customers are great
bad,"The people I worked with were cool but, the way the company is run and the way most of the stores are managed are awful. I had a manager actually try to get me to work off the clock and when I reported it to the company they didn't do anything about it. They don't care about the cashiers or the stockers. It's all about management and that's it. Definitely not worth it if they don't protect their employees as they claim to do in all of the training they give you and posters around the offices. Also, really bad pay."
bad,I'm still here but It's a revolving door. I've had 4 different supervisors since Oct. 2017 with my most recent one not having no experience in the field..
bad,"to much time at work and not at home"
bad,"extremely limited budget,does not help when ,critically staffed or help provide solutions,works their managers ungodly hours with no concern to hteir health or well being."
bad,"Worked with the public. ( Could be hard depending on location)"
bad,"my typical work day start with opening the checking email then walking the store to see if the store was recover the night before, making a list as I go of the thing to do for the day. next doing the deposit and counting the tills. ran the register and taking care of vendors and customers at the same time.at 10 get off the register start on the morning list and looking thought any back stock that may go out to the floor. after the closing manager come in go to the bank and take the deposit come back and walk the store with the closing manger. now start working on back stock and making sure the backroom is ready to received a delivery at all time. end of the day walk make sure all associates or in place and no issues before I leave for the night."
bad,Left alone for extended periods of time. Associates did more than the managers as far as workload and initiative. Not much room for advancement. I decided to leave the company because I found out that there are no yearly incentive pay raises. Why work for a company that you can only lax out at 10 an hour unless you were the store manager?
bad,"Early and long work hours, low pay, terrible work ethic on coworkers."
bad,"A typical day at my store means you are micro-managed by the store manager who doesn't appreciate anything you do. The only time she is nice is when she wants something from you, as in coming in on a day off or staying late. She rarely will give you a requested day off, if at all, no matter how much advance notice is given. She does not honor the schedule of your availability that you filled out on your application. Plays favorites, so unless you are in her group, you get the short end of the stick."
bad,"I had some help with the job, but it was a great job. I learned how to multitask with dealing with customers and stocking shelves. There were some moments where I had to help the manager because she wasn't doing her part."
bad,"The store was always short staffed with sales associates because most of them quit a couple months after starting. I was called in almost every day off I had due to someone calling in, not showing up, or quitting and you couldn’t really say no you weren’t coming in without leaving someone there alone or making someone work a double because they only have two people working at a time."
bad,"Sales associates aren't given many hours, workload is insane, management constantly talking behind each other's backs, severe lack of communication and organization. The only good thing I can say is I love working with the customers."
bad,"Management would consistently change, there would never be a set store manager up to 6 months."
bad,"I have never worked for a company who is so little involved in making their stores better than Dollar General. The corporate employees have no idea the problems that are occurring in the stores, so therefore nothing changes."
bad,Typical part time job-low pay & very little benefits.  Your shift would change daily.  employees constantly leaving for new jobs.  Store manager was never there
bad,If you want a job where minimum wage and works you like a dog. Also no benefits and lucky to get 30 hour. And it is not just one job you have to do everything.
bad,"Open till 11pm on Christmas eve. Obviously don’t care about the employees. Open normal hours on all other holidays, including Thanksgiving, with NO holiday pay. Vacation? Forget about it. Regular reviews and raises? Forget about it. You have to demand a break if you want one and then it’s treated like you’re imposing on the company."
bad,to shop at dollar general is fine but when you start working for them there is no communication they fire you after you gave your to weeks and then you call Corp ate office they can not tell you anything
bad,"The location was so far gone, for the most part if someone didn't want to do something, it was up to the other person to pick up their slack while meeting a time requirement of getting your own work done. 7 day workflow plan was implemented but never followed. With trucks coming in on Friday the merchandise was supposed to be received, stocked and backroom cleared by Monday morning. However it was taking over a week with new freight coming in to get the previous weeks up. No organization what so ever from upper management with little to no assistance from district until last minute. We were even instructed not to interact with customers because it ""slowed down work""."
bad,"DG wants 12 employees to work 4hr an 45 mins a weeks. In this case you do not have to provide breaks, no chance of over time. "
bad,"I don't know if all dollar generals are like this but the one I worked in was fairly chaotic. Between people stealing from deposits, trying to set others up, running refund schemes, and the worker turnover rate, I can say with confidence that I will not be working there again. The DM has unfair expectations with unfair rules. I'd much rather be an associate than a lead or manager simple because of the disfunction surrounding that place. They hardly train you, and really just throw you in the fire and set you up for failure, especially if you try to move up. It gets more stressful and isn't worth the pay once you rise in position."
bad,"When one first gets this job, you'd think it will actually be decent but after a week or two it quickly goes downhill. False and broken promises on a consistent basis. I went to work for them because they promised that they would help pay for my school which never happened. At first when school was starting they said I hadn't been working there for long enough to reap that benefit, after months when I qualified (according to their policies) they still wouldn't pay for it because school was not in session (it was spring break)."
bad,I was a full time employee.  The lower Management treated me disrespectfully.  I left the job because I felt that I did not want to be employed by this particular store.
bad,"Hectic, very very poor management, no benefits or discounts, no 401k, no health insurance or any kind of insurance. working all holidays except Christmas til 10pm."
bad,"This was my first real job, I was excited but the turnover rate was very high less than six months of working here my store manager quit. We went through many acting store managers before finally receiving one."
bad,"The one that I worked at had a very poor manager and that made it hard to work there."
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years and though I became a lead sales associate fairly quickly, the pay still wasn't that good. I got a part time job and my manager stopped giving me hours and eventually I was removed from their system."
bad,"Nope, There is zero free time for family or friends. Never enough help, and the stores always are behind. The culture of the company is unlike any other ive ever managed."
bad,Work here if you don't want to have a home life and live at your store for basically no pay or benefits. Managers are not respected or appreciated and raises are a joke.
bad,"Dollar General is by far the worst company to work for. I was a Store Manager my salary was based on 40 hours,but was required to work 50 hours.Not enough payroll to run the store with."
bad,My crew and I got along good and got things done. I learned a lot from my co-workers. Hardest part of my job was my boss. Always had lots to do but  made day go faster.
bad,"Ok Company to work for if you are desperate for a job or 18 &  in high school or even a college student. UT THIS IS NOT A CAREER!!!"
bad,"From my employment there, Dollar General is a very stressful place to work with little to no ability to move up. The managers play favorites and push off their work onto the lower employees and would always rather hire from outside, or bring in someone from a different location, instead of promoting when they needed a new manager or key-carrier."
bad,"D.G has the potential to be an outstanding business and I was excited about going the company at first. I became disillusioned after realizing the corporation was more interested in throwing up new stores as opposed to taking care of the existing stores and their employees and customers.  They do not give enough hours to have enough employees and adequately run the store and promote safety for their customers. This results in a high turnover rate, disgruntled employees as well as stores with stock all over the place.  The customers complain about the lack of help, the crowding and the general overall in-organization of every store I have been in.  The potential is there."
bad,"A very physical and time demanding job. Promised shifts at interview but did not follow through with them.  Worked full time hours ( 30 plus hours per week) as a part time employee without benefits. The harder you worked to complete daily tasks (which we hardly ever met) the more work they gave you. "
bad,"typical day at work includes greeting customers, cashier duties, stocking shelves. close to home, wished it was a full time job with benefits. co-workers are friendly."
bad,"needs better organizational skills,needs better training for District managers and management team as a whole.The company needs to better understand the needs of the employees."
bad,this job was very challenging for a number of reasons very limited support from your dm because they were constantly being changed out very limited payroll the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and merchandising
bad,"As a store manager, Expect to work over 100 hours a week and thats not a figure of speech. 6am till 930-10pm at least 3-4 times a week and on other days its an 8 hour shift which means zero off days. You might get lucky with one off day every 21 to 30 days. You must complete seasonal change overs on time which requires moving unsold merchandise to other areas of the store to make room for new set. The problem with that is there is never any other place to put the unsold merchandise and placing it in the back is not an option. Constant call outs from key holders/ cashiers  because pay is not competitive enough to warrant dependability from them."
bad,"A typical day is clocking in, counting your draw and start helping customers, check out the customer's items. Be able to stand for long hours, bend, left, rush, mutely task and still get everything done that has been asked of you before your shift is done. Be able to unload the delivery truck, shelve items, clean, help customers. No matter what you are doing, no matter how behind you may be, the customers come first, keep a smile on your face, great any all customers as they come throw the doors, ask the customers if they need any help."
bad,This company dose not care about their employees. They are too worried about the bottom line. I worked part time barley got the oppuntuity to grow as an employee
bad,"The main one we had were I worked made the place a fun place to work.  But when he left, the new one came in and dropped everyone to 4 hours a week and showed little compassion for the employees or the customers."
bad,"Had I not been able to get used to the hectic work environment, I don't think I would've been able to stay working at Dollar General for as long as I did. However, I had a great store manager when I advanced to a management position at a new store that opened near where I lived, and that made it much more tolerable. That is, until it was just the store manager and myself doing all of the work, so I finally decided to put in my two-weeks notice and find something less stressful for better pay."
bad,Corporate is horrible they make you work with no power after hurricanes.. They don't like to pay their people that much.. They don't give you enough hours to complete the work that they expect you to have done
bad,A very hands on physical jobs with a lot of expectations from an individual. I definitely learned a lot from the job on a loading aspect. When it comes to management I felt as well as others it was very poor when it came to productivity and being set up to be successful throughout a nights shift.. The hardest part of my job was not having what was needed to load and be successful on the job such as roll trainers and straps just to mention a few. The thing I liked most about my job was the people I worked with we made it better for each other..
bad,Never really knew anything about management. But since working here it has opened my eyes and now I know how to open and close an entire store a lone count inventory and safe .
bad,"Only 2 people scheduled at store during most work days. Expected to  operate retail business while stocking shelves, layout new planograms, run cash registers and control theft in low income environment."
bad,"Dollar General is a poor place to work. You have to ask for a break if your on register, and hope you would get bathroom break. There's heavy lifting. They need to have extra associates working to allow for breaks, someone other than management."
bad,No help from supervisors. Couldn't keep help because of amount of work and low pay. The manager ends up working excessive hours and pay does not equal out. Would require you to cut hours which meant you had to work more hours.
bad,"Working for Dollar General is a job where it has to be for people without any kids. When being a key holder or sale assistant. You do not get many hours a week,"
bad,"They still start you out at $7.25. I was told by my manager at the time that there were no raises, no paid holidays even if you work the whole holiday. Before I quit, our district manager came in and instead of doing her job she was listening to music, on her phone all day, and misusing items we sold as chairs."
bad,"Everything you need it's at the store, great people, convenient prices, awesome deals online with digital coupons. Even food and grocery shopping as well"
bad,The Job lacked in motivation and what little motivation given was caused by the cut throat environment made by your fellow employees. I do not recommend this job for anyone looking for a career.
bad,"People always talked about each other or tried to get another person fired. Never made over 150, poor management. Very slow. Never had help when needed"
bad,I feared for my life everyday working due to no form of security knowing we have been rob multiple times something has to be done  I'm not sure if it's only at the stores in my area but this is a major issue and the reason of me leaving the company... but that was hardest part but I really enjoyed interacting with customers my great customer service skills got me plenty of retail job offers I do my job to the fullest once I moved up to lead Cashier I learned very quickly
bad,This job is chaotic and the stores are not given enough scheduling hours to effectively operate. You will be underpaid and expected to preform the duties of six people in one night.
bad,Management sucks at DG and you have opportunity for advancement but they like to give promotions and take them back..very unorganized and unfair work place
bad,"stay away there is no work life balance ,, no hours to complete the many daily tasks required micro managed in every aspect of your position, company does not care about the people keeping the doors open"
bad,typically understaffed because budgets are tight and work alone with workloads given for more than one person. are expected to perform tasks/procedures under time constraints which are unattainable because the people who are giving them do not work in store to see how it really is while in building.
bad,Management is required to work 6 days a week and 2 closing night shifts.  There is no work and life balance. Pay is below average for the amount of time you spend in the building.  And upper management doesn't back you up and labor budget is a joke. I was robbed twice with no extra security set in place.
bad,Stores are incredibly overstocked and no one there to help with getting it organized. Orders were being placed by upper management without even entering the store for inventory purposes. Each day we would stock and by the next truck there were too many cases to clear the stock room. Poor upper management. Poor communication.
bad,They give you more work than you can do and not enough hours to get it done in.They put more work on the part time workers and less work to the ones who are higher up.
bad,"I am trying to find a different job as soon as possible. I don't think anyone should work at this company. Corporate doesn't care about their employees or the customers. They say ""Customer First"", but they don't give enough resources for their employees to put the customer first. The workers and managers are over-worked, stressed, clueless (Because they aren't trained properly which is caused by not have been given the hours to put the time in to train them), this company is so cut-throat that advancement is like a revolving door. I have stayed at this company to spruce up my resume. I can't wait until I hit my 2 years and I can finally leave."
bad,The company has definitely tried to help it's employees be more effective but the lower forms of management (i.e. District and store managers) can be so flaky and in my experience it has been highly susceptible to favoritism.
bad,"I started working there as a part time after losing a warehouse job which was my very first job ever. I began November of 2016 and left voluntarily by October 27, 2017. Working at Dollar General has many problems, most noticeably the rules and regulations the Company has for the stores. This job should be nothing more but a Part Time job and nothing more. I'd suggest working during the holidays so around October till January. My experience was interesting. I had a few amazing coworkers that actually cared about their job and did their work while there were others that just didn't care about working."
bad,Manager was very hard to get along with and no matter what you couldn't do anything right. Didn't understand if you were sick with a fever and vomiting they still expected you to be there and run the store by yourself.
bad,The workplace dynamic at DG is poor. There is no support from mid level or upper level management to turn around failing stores much less hire and train new employees to help do so. Many regular employees are consistently no call/no show. The hardest part of this job is fixing all of the previous store managers inventory problems. The most enjoyable part is seeing the improvements to the store and interacting with the customers.
bad,"The expected workload is almost impossible to get done with the low payroll hours. This leads to frustrated customers, staff and especially managers who end up working extensive hours to offset the lack of payroll. The morale is usually low and the pay is not good for anyone outside of a store manager or higher position. As a store manager you are paid well but expect to work over 60 to 70 hours a week to run your store the way corporate expects it run."
bad,"A typical day has you working mostly alone, or playing catch up to other employee's unfinished work. I have learned that certain people in management do not care about the staff, but are quick to threaten their jobs. Hardest part of the job is watching people steal and you can only wave bye to them. The culture of the workplace is really every man for themselves, and do not do what others get away with while employed. Rarely get to take lunch or breaks, and the insurance doesn't pay a whole lot, for the price you have to pay to have it."
bad,They require you to do so much in a 5 hour shift for little pay and one other associate. They also give you no more than 25 hours a week. You can either open or close by yourself and be happy if your manager or the other associate shows up for work.
bad,dollar general was probably the worst working experience i've ever had. very slow paced. not very welcoming. and everything seemed as though it was everyone for themselves. there's no teamwork.
bad,i worked in 3 different stores an each one management was worse than the one before. i never was looked at for advancement to my own store. due to the fact no one of color ran a store in the district i was in
bad,"Upper management does not care about s5ore level employees. My store was robbed multiple times, staff held hostage and no one even asked if anyone was ok. Was told to continue operation. Then they would cut payroll forcing you to work alone in the store. Theft is an issue that appears to be ok due to the tax write off they receive. They are ok with losing hundreds of thousands from one store. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,"The place isn't a horrible place to work so long as you bite your tongue and hold it against every possible body, including the managers themselves. The best thing about the job is i learned or gained the tolerance of people and enjoy helping people now. The work environment depends on who you work with, but 80% of the time its toxic. The manager will take all the credit for your work and state they are doing all the work and get onto you for ""not"" doing your job properly. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to go home."
bad,"As the only salaried member of management in the building, the store standards and expectations fall entirely on you.  If you don't enjoy running the ""typical"" dilapidated Dollar General, you should expect to work 60 hours a week minimum.  The associate and management pay for hourly associates is a joke, and actually is insulting to offer most individuals."
bad,"The concept of DG is a good one, however, the labor hours allowed are so low that there is no way to accomplish everything that management wants a SM to accomplish.  Many hours worked alone because the budget is so low.  Many expectations.  No management support to succeed. No work/life balance unless you are a non-scrupulous and dishonest manager."
bad,I didn't really enjoy working there because the employees were hostile and the last manager I had before leaving was arrested for stealing merchandise from the store after store hours.
bad,"High turnover, they don't value their people. The expect to u to over work yaself.  They threaten ya job stability , unreasonable and hr. No better had one of the worst stores in theft no help from l.p. but got blamed for everything."
bad,Easy job but the management is poor. There is no job security. No benefits. No compensation. The environment is not friendly to talking about problems. Manager is not a fair one.
bad,"Typically, a person who works at Dollar General is responsible for everything. All employees do all the stocking, reset, store clean up, run register, pulling items to the front, returns, etc. I learned that it is a busy store especially on the weekends. the management was very nice and worked as hard as the rest of the employees. Based on who a person worked with, the environment could be good or not. The hardest part of the job was having an angry customer because of having to show their identifications for cigarettes. I really enjoyed making the customer's laugh and helping the customers find the items he or she was looking for."
bad,"I Liked the job at first but as time went on my hours were cut and schedule was constantly changed, never told what need to be done it was just bad for me, customers were better than management."
bad,You tend to get yelled at by everyone from the customers all the way to upper management never getting any encouragement for a job well done but torn down if you miss something
bad,"Low pay and no opportunities for more than 20 hours a week, unless workers are needed. Hard work for low pay,no advancement opportunities available for employees."
bad,As a former employee they work you into the ground. Work/life balance is complete trash and all they care about is shipping cases out to make their numbers look good. Stay away.
bad,They are lacking in many areas. Employees are overworked and underpaid. Management in my experience was not well. Went through multiple store and district managers.
bad,This was definitely not the same place it was when they opened. They don't care about the employees as much as they claim. There was  a lot of favoritism.
bad,"A typical day, working at dollar general would be coming in at 8 am to 3 pm. I worked  both shifts so sometimes i would come in at 3 pm and leave at 10 pm. a manager on duty would and me a till and i would go and count it. by then the store is open so i most likely already did cashiering duties. i would stock merchandise everyday, i also always had to tidy things up. I learned a lot from working at dollar general, like learning how to deal with customers when they got angry or learning how to be a faster cashier. The workplace was always very messy, they would often look to me to tidy things, but it usually ended up messy by the time i came back to work the next day. "
bad,My experience working for this company was not a favorite of mine besides some of my co-workers and favorite Customers the environment and the way the company run is very stressful and unorganized
bad,"Working at Dollar General is what you would expect. When you work as at cashier, you sometimes have to help stock on truck days, but mostly you just stand there and check people out.  Some customers can suck, but like at all retail jobs, the customers vary, and some can be awesome. "
bad,"No benefits,minimum wage, work you to death with no compensation. Must have open availability regardless your personal life. No work place culture. Cuts payroll to the bone, yet expects us to have the work of 3 people done. I was asked for the second time to run a store. In fact this store was in shambles. It took me three months to completely empty the stock room and make it fully functional again. During that time I increased sales, fired some people, hired new crew, and was able to get out om the floor all the holiday given the fact that I took over the store the second week in October and not even Halloween was set. When asked if I could have the store I was told I didn't have enough time in."
bad,We were greatly understaffed and was asked to work more hours than scheduled.   Management was very hostile and rude and unpleasant to all employees.  The truck delivery days  were especially strenuous and overwhelming due to the process of unloading and restocking shelves.  Constant customer complaints about wait time in the lines and assistance throughout the store.
bad,"This was a very basic job. Nothing special just a typical cashier job. Other job requirements involved stocking shelves, taking out the trash, and counting money at the end of the day."
bad,"Direct management was fine, anyone higher didn't seem to care. Gave enough work for a crew of people and would only allow hours for a max of 2 maybe 3 people per shift. Most days the store was ran with a total of 4 people 2 on each shift with the intentions of accomplishing things that were impossible. The threat of lose of employment was there often. Expectations were much higher than we could have possible reached as well as anyone above store manager would complain and order things be accomplished even with very short of staff and would not be willing to help with the issues themselves, High stress because the company is more concerned with how much they are making than keeping any employees. Turnover is high."
bad,Due to lack of management there is no structure for steady employment. Often worked alone for 8+ hours without break or lunches. Worked several weeks without a day off and denied full time with benefits.
bad,"The stores are on the dirtier side. Overall its a very easy job. I either stocked shelves, reorganized the same shelf for the 3rd time that week, or stood at the register waiting for someone to walk in the door. If you;re into doing nothing, its the perfect job."
bad,"It's full of drama and ya get lied to about the pay you are told you would get, you start out getting more hours and then they take them away so you don't get paid much it's a job but all I can say about it they don't know how to treat the employees"
bad,Work managers 80+ hours a week for 40 hours pay.  Expect managers to be miracle workers with very little budget.  Don't take care of employees when injured.  Very poor company to work for.
bad,"I worked anywhere from 50-70 hours a week because of the labor structure. Even though I had increased net sales 10-15% and was very well liked by my customers and employees, it was still not enough for corporate so I put in my notice and vowed never to work retail again."
bad,"I would go to work and work hard, but someone alsways had something to say about my work ethic. I was by myself for my whole shift unloading pallets off truck and i couldn't get it done so they cut my hours to 9.5 a week. I worked under those conditions for about 3 months and couldn't take it anymore."
bad,I began my shift by stocking products from back room . Rarely did i work on register but i also did that as well. But customers there were really rude .
bad,dollar general dont care about your school or working around your schedule. management is a 0. district manager can careless about the company. definatley work you like a animal for little wage.
bad,"hard to keep store clean, floors nasty, customers steal constantly and leave items everywhere, no benefits, low wages, advancement only pays about $0.50 more than a regular cashier"
bad,While I worked there the manager was very rude to customers and employees. My Hours were very unstable and would fluctuate having near 40 one week and then less than 10 another.
bad,Very stressful job I trained for 2 weeks one with trainer \ one week trainer in my home store. Did not happened i feel they threw me in to the fire.. .....................
bad,I worked here during college. I was part time and the women who i worked with would rather smoke cigarettes than actually do there job. Wouldn't expect much more from people there though. Wasn't worth my time.
bad,This company isn't even worth wasting my breath for. Why would anyone work at a place with bad management. Especially when they don't care about their employees.
bad,"It seems simple at first, but as your coworkers slack off, be they superior or not, your manager will expect you to pick up the slack. Write ups if you don't. They have no care for your personal life, so no matter what, always show up. Pay sucks, and raises don't exist. If you smoke, good luck getting a break. The company overall is junk."
bad,"my experience working there was horrible, coworkers wasn't doing their jobs and I had to go behind them and do what they didn't do. a manager tried to write me up for something that another coworker didn't do"
bad,It was a fun place to work because the whole time I worked there the manager was out on leave. It was more difficult than it had to be because everyone goofed off and didnt get anything done.
bad,"This company constantly increases labor intensive programs, while consistently cutting hourly labor budget. While company hiring practices indicate that Store Managers are expected to work 45-50 hrs per week, it ends up being more like 70 hrs, because salaried Store Managers have to pick up the slack in labor hours."
bad,"The location I worked was constantly understaffed and had a large turnaround rate. The training for employees was minimal and lacking. The management was not helpful and did not support or encourage employees. The benefits were not very good. The workplace was often filled with tension, lack of communication, and lack of teamwork. The hardest part of the job was the lack of teamwork and organization within the company. The most enjoyable part was meeting all sorts of customers and having regulars that made the day more pleasant."
bad,"while working at dollar general i was being sexually harassed by an assistant store manager, after reporting the incident, fellow associates told me they had experienced the same treatment by the same person. I was told i wouldn't have to work with him in the future and i shouldnt have had that experience. about a whole week passes and i see we share not just one hour, but every day for 10+ hours with each other. alone. Also i was working 40+ hours and was only a part time worker due to being a student. I never got overtime or benefits following the excessive hours."
bad,No concern about there employees the computer systems are always breaking down and freezing up needs new system also no benefits and no security to protect their employees
bad,My typical day at work left me feeling like nothing that I had gotten accomplished was good enough. We had very little time to accomplish all the tasks that were expected of the employees.
bad,"Wages were low, work was taxing, management didn't seem to grasp the concept of inventory management. not bad for someone younger or with no real skills, the work was easy as it is an entry level job."
bad,"store was not well kept and i felt tricked once hired on because it was so unorganized from inventory to the product on the shelves."
bad,"pay is decent but the lack of faith and trust in store managers from upper management is strongly upsetting. they trust no one at all."
bad,"I was excited about working for Dollar General in the beginning. It was my first time managing a store that dealt with more than just clothing. I learned a lot quickly, primarily due to the fact that they throw you out there to sink or swim. My store training manager was nice, but she was so overwhelmed with all that they required of her. This left me to learn a lot own my own by trial and error. I was assigned my first store on the day that the previous store manager, as well as assistant manager, and key holder ALL walked out. This left me with 3 sales associates, and no help from DM or any other store in the area. In turn I worked 80+ hours a week for about 3 weeks straight until I was able to hire more people. One perk of the job is meeting so many people. There are customers from my first store that I still communicate with and there are some that I have become close friends with. Some of my customers were the reason that I held on for so long. They will appreciate you more than the company will. The pay for anybody below SM is ridiculously low regarding the expectations the company has for employees. Turnover is high. It's no biggie to have at least 1 person quit on you per week, right before they are scheduled to come in. As with all the dollar stores, theft is very high. Not only that, but extremely dangerous! It's absolutely nothing for a customer to attempt to fight you just for offering them customer service in an attempt to deter their plan to shoplift. And don't even think about asking for security! That's what you're there for. But don't tick the customer/potential"
bad,"This job take a different kind of person!!. Hard on your body can really bring your morale down. Hard to keep staffed."
bad,"This place was there when I needed it, so I am very thankful. Most work days were difficult due to customers, but manageable."
bad,"I have worked here for the past 2 years. I was promoted to a store training manager with out receiving any raise in pay. They talk about promoting from within but that's so they can low ball you on your salary. If your ok with taking one day off a week and working a half because you are on salary, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"The managers were treated badly. More work load than was worth the pay grade was given. You had to beg to get more than 30 hours a week, even being full time employee."
bad,They do not have enough employees to complete all the tasks that they require of you in the time frame. They do not have a good policy for hiring new people in a timely manner.
bad,The store I worked at for the Dollar General was over worked and had to many tasks to complete each day compared to the amount of staff and work hours.
bad,"Keep work area clean and smile and speak to all customers."
bad,"I work at the Dollar General in Madisonville Tn. and I call in to work one day sick as a dog. I always come in when they call me, and I am never late, and I do my best and now I only get maybe 10 hours a week!!"
bad,"Sorry place to work overall... General and store management was terrible, security was terrible, store was unclean and unorganized.I would never work for DG again anywhere nor would I refer anyone to work for DG."
bad,I worked here for nearly 3 years and at first it was great. They cut your hours a lot if your not willing to work whenever luckily I would be the one who worked all the holidays and the shifts nobody wanted.
bad,"The worst job I ever had. It's the type of job that will destroy your vehicle, health, self esteem and family life if you stay long enough. As a Store Manger, expect to work 6-7 days a week. Expect for a computer program to dictate your work schedule, and you must follow it 100%. Expect to be poorly treated, and underappreciated. Expect to try an establish a culture with an ever changing, under qualified, poorly paid staff. Expect to work alone...a lot, and still expect unrealistic amounts of work to be completed. Expect to constantly be at risk for theft and being robbed at gun point. Expect for your DM to make private phone calls to associates, questioning the daily practices of your store. The District Manager I had operated like the leader of a street gang. She recruited select managers to do her dirty work, and be her eyes and ears. She also gave these select managers dominion over all the other store managers. So even if you have one DM by title, you will actually have about 3. A lot of times, they are in your building while you are not there. It's not worth it. I can go on and on. Don't do it."
bad,"Dollar General has a challenging working environment, that is perfect if you have a low maintenance life does not require much attention. Opportunities for moving up to supervisor are easy if you work hard."
bad,"The management has room to work, specifically favoritism and insubordination. Always working with insufficient staff and worked on breaks in order to avoid lines at check out. The co-workers are fun and easy to get along with. There isn't room to move up the ladder unless you have significant experience. Training is watching videos and then throwing to the wolves. Management help is hard to get."
bad,Need to be under better msg because ally of thing could change we deal with so much with very little pay and unfair hrs . and it is just unconvinced . needs tlc
bad,"A typical day at work was having to cashier and recover half of the store since there were only two of us allowed to be there at the same time. My manager was fine but the district manager was to untrusting with us. Would always accuse us of stealing, not doing our jobs, jacking around. I didn't get to know my co-workers to much except for three over a year of rotating so many workers. The hardest part of the job was doing my job. You're expected to give good customer service, ring everyone up AND recover half the store. There were nights that I was on the register for five out of the six hours I worked, the other hour was me trying to walk away to get some work done but having to walk straight back. The most enjoyable part of the job was we got to turn our pandora on, but getting promised a promotion five times then watching someone get hired into the position you were trained for, sucked."
bad,I like the customers but working under a store manager who doesn't care about his job made it hard on me! My store manager only sits on the phone with women all day versus training me how to be successful. He slaves us on weekends after truck days & never gives breaks but takes it out our time. The pay for the job sucks & I wouldn't recommend a homeless person to work here! I hate it!!!
bad,"The management is horrible, they want you to do a lot of work for little pay, and the hours are ridiculous. A typical work day consist of doing everyone's work and dealing with being short-handed. The only good part is my co-workers, they're great."
bad,Dollar General is a company that has forgotten that the people who work for them are PEOPLE. The corporation puts huge work loads on the staff but takes away the hours needed to get the work completed. They also like to threaten employees with losing their jobs if the work isn't completed in the time allowed which is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to do unless you are a robot with ten arms. They claim to be all about their customers but the truth is they care more about whats in the customers wallet as oppose to the actual person. Dollar Generals stores would be much cleaner and much more customer ready if they allowed their employees time to make it that way.  The only thing good about working for Dollar General are the friendly regular customers and my fellow co workers.
bad,"At Dollar General they use the term ""Low Budget Operator"" as if you're supposed to be impressed. Don't be fooled. Basically it means ""work your managers to death in order to pick up the slack we created running on a skeleton staff"". In the past there seemed to be a lot of hope for the growing company. We were opening stores at an incredibly rapid pace. In the 5 years I've been with DG we have opened over 3000 stores. Which would cause anyone to believe that this Corporation is going somewhere. Unfortunately, no company can have everything. You can't serve rock bottom prices to the customers, give your shareholders a big return on their investment AND compensate your employees fairly. Or so Dollar General seems to believe. And guess who got the raw end of the deal? Why yes, the employees of course. So if you're looking for a job that will place outrageous demands while offering the very smallest amount of payroll, barely meet your competitors pay and benefits and require a 6 day work week for managers to boot then this is absolutely the best place to apply. However if you have a shred of self respect then I would do some research on Dollar General (there's a fantastic, scathing article from the Huffington Post a few years ago) and then apply anywhere else."
bad,I worked there because i used to have an awesome manager before the one i have now. Dollar General doesnt give benefits or anything
bad,Was very easy but I worked very few hours. I went to other stores to pick up more hours and still could never hit 40. Didnt stay there long needed something full time.
bad,Working there you get pretty good hours sometimes to many all at once. My first week working there I was left in the store for 3 hours by the store manager. The store itself is busy and not a harsh place to work but management is truly unprofessional. Not really a job I would recommend for short tempered or easily tired workers.
bad,"They dont take care of there people, you have no life outside of work just sleep when you can. when you schedule a day off its not guaranteed cause they will remove you from the list without saying anything. Not enough time off."
bad,"There are never enough hours scheduled to accommadate the store needs, The hours scheduled do not leave much time for family outside of work"
bad,The other cashiers were easy  to work with but the management was all two faced...No one ever told anyone thanks or that you did a good job
bad,Never would have left there on my own but getting through manegment is impossable. They change the rulrs daily as they go along and the workers are the ones who's fault everything is.You make there if they want you to and you dont any other way.Time spent on the job and work done means nothing.
bad,"Once someone is locked into one of three keyholders, there is no room for expansions. They expect full time work from part time Hours."
bad,"Dollar general is infamous for it's turnover, employee and customer theft, and lack of benefits. Their stores rarely have good managers, and the company goal is profit, not service."
bad,"Most days I really enjoy my job.  But at times it can be difficult when your boss is always negative.  No compliments, always complaints.  You're always afraid of being yelled at when you walk into work for your shift.  It makes a person dread going to work sometimes.  I definitely was able to learn better customer service skills and how to manage a group of people the proper way."
bad,"I would come in the store and open and my store manager would leave and I would open up the store. Count drawers, Open the safe to count that. Then I would open the store and I would stock the shelves and I would help customers with their items. I learned that young managers are hard to work for due to their age. My co-workers were ok for the most part. Some work harder then others. THe customers that came it were the enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"Work was ok and fun sometimes, but management is bad. the people that came in was interesting. Nothing else to say, but don't work there"
bad,"I was one of the first employees to work at a newly opened store and it was extremely hectic.  The volume of people plus the work load was too much for the mere two employees that worked there.  The compensation was terrible and the hours got really bad because the District Manager wanted to save money.  Despite the store's manager plead for more work hour approval she was told to make her staff work.  Go backs were never done because it was always a key holder and a cashier working at nights.  When you factor in cashing, go backs, recovery and providing help it was just too much for two people at such a huge store with so much traffic.  I t was like a slave ship."
bad,"i enjoyed working there because i love working with the public and interacting with people. I learned alot while i was in management there the importance of profiting of the company and helping to save the company losses due to overspending in payroll, reducing hours to save payroll dollars and helping with inventory losses."
bad,"terrible place to work, only management and supervisors get full time hours, but really low pay. hardest part is getting enough hours scheduled in a week to at least make a little bit of money."
bad,"Lots of stocking, lots of running around. You will def be short on labour hours and more then likely working on the average of 60 hours."
bad,"No hours ,no breaks, left alone,no praise,uppermangement only look out forthemselves. Only care about ticket sales."
bad,I thoroughly enjoyed my job and those I worked around. I loved the challenge that each day brought of the heavy lifting and the quick thinking in order to fit all merchandise on the truck for efficient shipping. The hardest part of the job was having to quit so I may attend college when I was told that I would have the support of management in doing so.
bad,"The ONLY redeeming quality about this job is some of the customers. There are no pros to this jobs. I barely make enough money to get gas for my car so that I can get to work and back. The company is only concerned about the bottom line. Employees in the store quit and leave after a few months. Of the current employees in my store, three of have been there almost a year. Those three are the store manager, the assistant manager, and myself. For two months, the only three people working at the store were us. Two employees quit, one for legal reasons, one to go work at McDonalds. I am a combat veteran, and I would rather be back in Kandahar, than working at Dollar General. At least when I was down range, I knew who could be trusted. As a key holder, one of my duties is to ensure the security status of the store. if the alarm goes off in the middle of the night, Lead Sales Associates (key holders) are the ones that have to answer the call. The police say it's an unregistered alarm so they can't respond. The town police station is less than a mile from my store, and they refuse to drive by and check it out to see if I, as a civilian, will be driving into a burglary or if it is just a balloon setting off a camera. There is no opportunity for advancement, or pay raises, because there is a labor and wage cap. If my boss gives me more hours, she has to cut other employees, or risk being yelled at by the District Manager. If she pays me more, she risks hitting the wage cap, and then she gets yelled by the District Manager. No advancement, no pay, no joy or satisfaction."
bad,"Typical days at dollar general are very demanding because of the increasing pressure to cut cost for check bonuses the district manager would squeeze every ounce of labor out of the stores. Want a promotion ok,change your school schedule do the job for six months without pay or job title and then we might promote pay and promote you but no back pay sorry. "
bad,"worked hard and never was good enough"
bad,"Wasn't properly managed, some employees were treated well while others were treated very poorly. No recognition for doing a good job."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with store employees, vendors and customers."
bad,"Setting up the displays for the different sales promotion and also maintaining the sale to make sure that all the items in the sale stay in stock to keep the customer happy."
bad,"The customers make the job while my title is Cashier i often act as management.For the amount of work the pay is little to nothing, bottom line it's a great place to shop but not to work."
bad,Stores run on a very small staff because we aren't given the labor to either hire people or schedule anyone. There is a lot of work required but you usually are alone trying to get it all done. The pay is terrible and nowhere near what it should be regardless of experience.
bad,"A typical day consist of putting out stock and you had only 2 days to do so .  These two people work together for 4-6hrs, then a keyholder comes and relieves the store and assistant managers. Then a cashier comes in every 4-6hrs.  Employees were ok. The store managers were not consistent. They could be moved from store to store at any time to work another store.  Or to cover two stores at a time.  The best time of day for me was at closing time."
bad,"A typical day would include doing a bit of every thing.  Store recovery, stocking cleaning help customers receiving .  Then as store manager I would put together the daily bank deposit, and get the needed funds for the tills.  Learned that I liked small box retail management. I for the most part had excellent workers and supervisors. the hardest part of the job was doing the schedule, you cant please everyone.  Being new to the area as manager of the new store I quickly got to know and befriend many new people, and earn their respect."
bad,Working for dollar general was a mistake. You do more work than you get paid for and the management was a joke (in my area).
bad,"Was never properly trained in my job.  I have worked in management in retail for many years, and I know how and what to basically expect, and how to conduct myself as a manager.  I enjoyed working with pretty much everyone that I worked with.  The hardest part of this job was the fact that one manager expected me to know what they were thinking, and to do things that I had not been told about.  Employees should not have to be expected to work themselves into the ground daily.  Most enjoyable part of my job, was the regular customers that would come in and be appreciative of the fact that I would help them out and treat them with respect."
bad,"My day begins in counting money .im at cash register greeting customers,recovering items  to put back on shelves.Mngmt well they stock items all day long. The hardest part is retail is retail. just like people are people. I do not enjoy this job. (sorry 20 wrds or less"
bad,I am lead cashier and do stocking and pricing. I have no benefits and not enough hours.  The days I work and the hours I work are different every day.  I sometimes work late and go in early the next day.  It is difficult to plan care for my son when everything changes from day to day.
bad,"This was a great job for someone that likes to stock and do a cashier.  It definitely shouldn't be a forever job you will end up getting screwed by HR though if you ever have to take a extended leave for any reason.  For example I was in a car wreck back in march and i turned in my physical therapy form for my back. Then when i got done with my physical therapy i returned to my doctor and he said stay out another few weeks to let it finish healing and sent me a letter to take to them. I took said letter to them stayed out for a few more weeks.  After that i returned back to the job asking when i could start again and they said i was off the schedule and to call HR,  so i called HR and guess what i find i was terminated after being out 2 weeks with my back.  So if you ever get hurt don't turn it in because you'll be terminated almost immediately after.  My experience with Dollar General were pretty good up until that happened because I was never notified that i lost my job until i came back after the 8 weeks i was out, I had also been there 3 times in between and no one said anything about it."
bad,"First off let me say the store I worked for was brand new. I was there from day one setting up the store. And also trained at 2 other locations. Typical day at work for me was being the first one there everyday, having to wait on our manager on duty to show up late. I was one of 6 stockers originally hired here. Half quit after a couple weeks because we were lied to about the amount of hours we would receive. I stuck through with 2 other gentlemen who were hired with me. But it got to a point where I couldn't put up with it anymore. Our manager hired incompetent people to work registers so they would always need help or disappear for 15 minute cigarette breaks and the lines would be to the back of the store. Management didn't care, as our store manager hired her friends and people she worked with at past stores and none of them seem to care about the store at all. The district manager was an overly egotistical maniac who yelled at everyone even though we did EXACTLY what our store manager told us to do. I learned literally nothing from this job, except that Dollar General has horrible hiring practices, at least this location/area does. We had a lady transfer from another store to run our backroom, and our manager allowed this although knowing none of the current staff got along with this lady because we all were trained by her at another store, and she was hateful, rude, obnoxiously loud and overbearing, not only to other employees but to customers to. We had multiple customers hear how she talked to employees and come to us and ask how we put up with the abuse. She was then"
bad,There was a high level of a lack of communication between upper management and employees. There was also a lot of in-house bickering. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid weekly.
bad,"I feel I was used by the management and she was let go a few months ago for the way she used people. My coworkers were nice and friendly and I loved meeting new people. The customers were the enjoyable part of the job. I learned that Iove being around people and help them with there things,"
bad,"The company over all was poorly set up with no benefits to part time empoyees, not even an employee discount. The assistant store manager was very rough and rude with both employees and customers while the rest of the managers were quite pleasant."
bad,I could go in at anytime there was no set hours. I only made minimum wage. and i had no time for my child
bad,"Small ""mom and pop"" business with flexibility of work schedule but no benefit or advancement opportunities."
bad,"Very fast pacing, work mainly cashiering. The new store management lied to my face on me advancing to management. I loved my co-workers they were fun. I honestly did not enjoy working for this company, the corp. doesn't seem to care about their employees."
bad,"Typical day as a Manager starts with opening the store at 8 am by your lonesome until 10 am sometimes later. Many days registers, scanners, or handheld devices did not work properly. After hours on the phone with ERC the company will send the store a ""new"" replacement device. This ""new"" device will most likely give you more problems than the older one. This issue makes checking-in vendors and checking-out customers a  continuous game of  hit or miss."
bad,"This was a boring job for minimum wage. Management was rude, constantly making me look bad."
bad,doesnt care if you have the experience always holding you back and bashing you
bad,Working as a general manager at Dollar General was the worst job that I have ever held by far in my lifetime.
bad,Slave for a little of nothing and dont expect to get far in the business.
bad,"A typical day for me was always different. You are dealing for venters, trucks and customers at times you are the only one in the store will noon. As part of the management team I was always on my toes with floor work and paperwork. The hardest part of the job i have to say is watching your back for other employees and the best part is enjoying to the great customers that you get."
bad,"Sadly this was not a good place to, management made racist remarks in front of employees, employees favored allowed to leave work early, special treatment while other employees were treated bad in order to get the to quit."
bad,It was very unorganized and had favoritism from Mgr. Enjoyed being around the customers.
bad,"I learned a lot for working at Dollar General, store is located in a small town and I loved the people that I interacted with on a daily basis...customer service was a very high priority. I learn how to delegate a crew of 2-5 people in a efficient and timely manner. I was able to work with different vendors and take in 2 trucks a week with anywhere from 900-2000 pieces of merchandise that had to be stocked within 1-2 days of delivery...My co-workers were amazing and I loved each and every one of them...the were very easy to delegate jobs too...the hardest part of my job was working night shift and not being home with my daughter and husband at night ...I also attend a church that has small group classes at night that I attend...the most enjoyable part of my job was the people that I encountered everyday...even the tough and seemingly hard to deal with customers were a challenge but most rewarding to me...knowing that I was able to help them no matter what the issue was..."
bad,I wouldn't recomend this company or atleast the district manager to work.
bad,"I was terminated because my store manager instructed me to copy the tobacco count from one day to the next without actually counting. I never considered the thought that I was violating company policy by ""falsifying company reports,"" even though I was instructed to do it."
bad,"I used to love my job, until we got new people at corporate. I really love my co-workers. I bust my butt daily for this company with no rewards."
bad,"I did not like working here at all,but the only thing that kept me from not quitting was my manager and my co-workers. They were all good people and being in a small store we depended on each other a lot to succeed. The amount of work you do for such small pay is really horrible. The place I work at has 3 registers but only 2 is used. One by the associate and the other by the manager. But majority of the time the associate is the one to work at the register,because the manager is off stocking and doing other tasks. And during your time there you need to work the register and stock/clean/organize your assigned area depending on what time you work there. There is so many things wrong with Dollar General as a company. Some of their deals are wrong which causes problems in the store,causing stress for you and the customers. And even some of their prices are wrong in the store. And the manager does not have time to go look at everything because they are busy setting up new things in store and stocking constantly."
bad,I have learned to deliver customer service in every situation. I run the register most of the time and also stock products. Typical work hours are 8-3.
bad,there have been 7 store managers within 3 years at this store. management and upper management are less than desirable and cannot be depended upon.
bad,Stocked shelves. management ok. hardest part is doing everyone elses job.
bad,"Outside looking in, this company makes every employee count!!!! This company will work you to the fullest to maximize every extent of your skill and ability. Management reflects the appearance of EVERY store! This is not to say store management, but also District and Regional management. So if you walk into a Dollar General and the store looks a mess, bare in mind it is not just the inability of the employees and store manager in maintaining a fully wonderful store appearance and experience, it is also the inability of the District Manager and Regional Manager in providing the support every store employee needs to create a positive and productive culture. If you ever walk into a Dollar General that is neat and clean and looks amazing, remember that it reflects a wonderful TEAM on every level!!!! The saying one bad apple spoils the bunch is true!!! I learned that EVERYONE must be willing to appreciate their job functions and provide customer service to the fullest to succeed while working at the store level for this company. The hardest part of this job is pulling the weight for those not willing to be a TEAM PLAYER!!!"
bad,"I arrive at work about 10 minutes early to put personal belongings in a secure place and clock in on time.  Usually the main cashier is expected to restock and straighten shelves when customers are not present, meet and greet entering customers and offer assistance as needed.  "
bad,I think the only thing that made my job worth it was helping and getting to know the customers and becoming friends with so many wonderful people that walked through those doors daily.
bad,"You get low pay and treated like garbage....."
bad,I feel I was discriminated against due to race and gender. I was always being turned down to advance because they had brought women from other stores before looking at someone who had been there for a long time and worked hard to get everything they wanted done. They said it was not their fault but the District Manager was at fault. Numerous things I could name off. Maybe it was just that store. Hope someone else has better luck.
bad,"It all depended really"
bad,"A typical day at work included constantly stocking shelves, and running the register, along with management responsibilities. I learned how to open, and close the store, and how to run the store. The hardest part of the job was being over worked, and under staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the responsibilities. "
bad,Dollar general is not the place for me. I dislike the amount of work they make you do for very little money. Upper management is out of touch with reality. 
bad,"This is your last result job if you are an adult. If you are a teenager that needs a source of income, this is the job for you. Something that keeps a little spending change in your pocket."
bad,Regular day at the dollar general would be just to ring out customers as they wait in line. I learned that if you talk with the customers  the line might not go as fast but it will go smoother because people ease a lil tention. Management and co workers all became friends of mine we worked great together. Hardest part would be to deal with the irate customers who go caught stealing and to try to get them to release the products and stay within the store till the cops came. best part of the job would be the different diversities that would come in.
bad,"The year I spent at this organization was awful. They pay only minimum wage, you are working harder and there are no hours unless you are in management, and being in management it is tougher because you are expected to be there when you are scheduled, and you are responsible for every part of the store which is very stressful unless you can find a great crew to help you, which with what they are paying the employees, it is very rare to find. you have no life when you are a manager at Dollar General, they expect you to be there all of the time."
bad,"Basically cashiering, putting up stock closest to the register (cosmetics, hair products), and assisting the manager as needed."
bad,i work very hard to be treated unfairly by the higher up managers when they change an allready made schedule by headquartes to benefit themselves having holidays off.
bad,"I would come into work and have to clean, make sure customers were well helped, and check them out. Dollar General could learn how to treat there people and be more trust worthy. You get the feel that they dont want to be there doing there job. So that doesn't help you want to work there, its really a downer. I would have to say i did like the people i met and the things i learned."
bad,"Typical work day was long, I learned how to NOT manage a store. Upper management could care less if you needed help. They want there managers to work 6 days a week, and want you to DRAW little bar graffes that could be done by computer. There was no enjoyable part to this job."
bad,A typical day at work is unorganized. The priorities of Dollar General are out of order. Customer service is not what it should be.
bad,Dollar General isn’t a bad place to work. Great fellow employs but it lacks advancement and possibility of a career for me. I wish to move on to something that uses my skill sets and that I enjoy doing.
bad,"very bias with job oppertunity, and equality ,compasion of one's means of makeing a living"
bad,The store is always a mess and management was terrible.. never had enough help on registers... would promise a job and then give to other people
bad,Busy learning experience and increased knowledge of merchandise mix for this type of store
bad,"The long hours and always working the night shift before I have school the next day is horrible. I do get enough breaks throughout the day, depending on who the manager of the day is. I am not happy in this work place and I am trying my best to move on from it."
bad,Never endding challenges but a lot of fun working with my crew plus getting to know all of my customer's and having fun with them as well. Sometimes they don't give you enough time to get everything done
bad,At this job these particular things are very important to me. What is beyound frustrating is when none of your co workers feel the same way.
bad,"They hire people to come in and do the impossible. The management team does not work with you, and is only interested in what will benefit them."
bad,"It was a place where I learn all my management skills from, how to check invoices in the computer how to unload a truck, and most of all my customers."
bad,they are a seasonal position for the halloween custome nice selection of all custumes that you may want
bad,The job allowed me to work on my socializing skills with the public while providing adequate income during school.
bad,"Very under appreciated "
bad,"my typical day at work was restocking shelves and helping customers with any of their needs"
bad,Extremely long hours. It is possible to work 15 hours a day and 7 days a week and still not be able to complete tasks. Extreme amounts of travel. A huge amount of turnover in management positions above you
bad,It didn't seem like the company cared for its workers. I was hired as part-time and worked as full time. That was fine with me but it's hard to operate a store of that size with only 2 people per shift. They just expect too much and show no appreciation.
bad,"Its always possible to get 40 hours if you go and help at other stores. I had a great team that i worked with. It showed when working together, it really works."
bad,"They like to work you as much as you are willing and the slotted hour’s. They hire almost anyone but you have to pass a background and drug test, along with a personality test."
bad,This company does not have any full time employees and corporate is always asking the store manager to cut back on hours. It makes it very hard to get everything done that is expected. The manager works instead of other employees.
bad,Employees advanced based on friendship with manager and not on work performance.  Hours were not enough to keep me driving 40 miles to work then 40 back home.
bad,"Assistant manager"
bad,"I don't recommend working here because management is disorganized, workplace doesn't seem safe, hardest part of the job was to have the motivation to finish your shift."
bad,Never know whether your gonna be working 4 or 5 days no communication management is terrible there is no chance of advancement and growth and pay is lower than most other places around
bad,"I did not have the best experience working at Dollar General. The managers would wait til the last minute to post the schedule to the point where I wouldnt know when I was working til hours before my shift. They scheduled me the day of my prom and graduation party even though I requested them off and even called me the day of my graduation to ask me to work. I dont believe the have much care for your private, family life .But atleast its a job, it worked for high school."
bad,"too much to do, so little time. fulltime leads Are supposed to have a min of 30 hrs per week. however you only get it if your the favorite. the stores are given hours less than whats needed to effectively run and manage a store."
bad,I worked for this company for 3 years in three different locations and I learned a lot in the area of customer service. Dollar General is definitely a built to last business but the management of the company from the low level was very poor. Nothing you ever did was good enough so I made the decision to leave and better myself and I haven’t looked back.
bad,As a store manager you were often working multiple stores at the same time.  When asst. Mgrs left or moved on there was no sense of urgency to replace them.  As a manager you were just expected to work 7 days a week 16 hours a day.  No work life balance at all.  You felt as if you didnt matter. When you left they replaced you with another person who was totally unaware of the culture.
bad,Need to make their businesses better by giving their employees better hours and better benefits. The management of the stores does not help keep the bigger stores under control. I feel like the company good help more by giving more hours and more people than what they allow.
bad,"At my location, communication is an issue. When you start, your training is on computer. You practically have to train yourself. You have to work whole shifts sometimes by yourself. My best days are when I work on sales floor with a cashier taking care of customers."
bad,"Its was not a fun time. They want 2 people to do the work of 5 and expect you to basically kill yourself with work, and out of 2500 customers per day, only 3 are nice. The rest are mean and have not nice attitudes. You get punched in the face, you're only supposed to smile and ask if they want the blood and teeth in a bag."
bad,In a management position you can hardly ever make plans with family or friends and keep them. Due to always being called into cover shifts and take care of problems.
bad,Dollar general starts you out part time and only making minimum wage. The hours were not enough for me. Plus if we were short handed I would get more hours but if we were not I was lucky to get 18 hours a week. I had to quit there due to not getting enough hours and not enough money.
bad,Working here was my first job ever and I though would be my last ! Management was super slow and inventory and stock isles where always over stocked and boxes where left every where ! Probably the worst first job you can have and the key holders are super bossy !
bad,The reason why i stopped working here is because when i would work other people's shifts i wasn't getting paid for it . It never showed that i did get paid for it on my check stubs and my card didn't match the numbers of a card on my check stubs so i really was trying to figure out how was i getting paid . I went to try to talk to the district manager's sister about it and she called my phone back and told me that i was messy when i was working pregnant with my second child at the time
bad,"Alwats buisy, used where needed most, short handed most times. You will not get bored. Randem drug tests seemed like the same people tested most times. Your only worth to them is when your healthy. What have you done for me lately. If your young, healthy and like overtime they will be more than happy to have you."
bad,Stop trying to keep managers whose only there for pay checks. Assistant managers do all the work and never get credit or bonuses. We're there when nobody is
bad,"Change in management has caused problems at work with the manager that came in trying to switch our schedules. District manager will tell me one thing and then turn around and tell others another. Poor management, overworked and underpaid. I now after 1.5 years I fully understand the high turnover rate in this company!"
bad,Store manager is the not a great leader. The pay is the best because of the amount of responsibility you have. There very little training to all employees full time and part time
bad,"Don’t ever take this job you will do everything from cashier truck stock everyday oversea everybody clean the stores do the managers job they should be doing never ever get Friday’s and Saturday’s off should get  more pay cause it’s all on the keyholes all the cash handling and the bank drops everything will be on you very hard job, most of the time no breaks because you can’t leave."
bad,"I was forced into the store manager position less than a month after being hired with only one day of training. Despite the lack of training and compensation of a manager, I was expected to keep the store operating smoothly and was treated poorly if things didn't go well. We were forced to work poorly staffed with low hours and low pay. There is little respect or appreciation shown by the management at Dollar General."
bad,"While working there I felt as if management was non-existent, while at the same time there was no person autonomy in decision making. It might have been different depending on if your manager was hands on but I just had an overall bad experience with the job."
bad,"This is a fun place to work but it absolutely depends on co-workers and management. The compensation is the poorest I've ever had, corporate doesn't let stores hire enough people and the manager only cares about their personal life and we do not have enough people to cover emergencies, leading to being degraded when we need to call out. Not worth the pay."
bad,"Great retail experience. Poor management from supervisors or cooperate, stressful at time due to poor management, pay wage are poor, never show employees appreciation"
bad,I started out a cashier then moved up to a keyholder.  The management is poor. The one I worked under was very unprofessional. It was chaos alot. She also forgot to turn in hours for me twice causing me to not receive my checks til the next pay day.
bad,The only positive thing about working at this job is that you get paid weekly. I do not recommend anyone working here that has children. You will not see them very often. And if you don't have the proper Staffing maybe not at all. It is not a great place to work at all and upper management does not care. I have had issues and actually lost it on upper management for the simple fact is I wasooowas done. And if you're somebody who has any social anxiety depression do not come here you will regret it immensely. My manager tried her best but she is just one person who ends up working up to almost a hundred hours a week. Know that we only had a staff of 3 and as we begged for help we didn't get it. We worked like this for over a month and most of us have littlw kids. It was really bad... we tried hard and we did our best but it didn't do much. I was recommended by doctors only work about 20 hours. And higher ups maybe work over 40. They allowed my mental state to decline and at the time I wasn't able to quit that job. I finally had to quit it do to a literal  breakdown.  I was even asked to finish my shift even though it was clear I was unable. It's really sad because the job could have been good if the store actually cared about their employees.
bad,Love working with employees and the customers. Unfortunately I never get the amount of hours I was promised and it's hard to get time off when needed.
bad,Job was described to me differently than what I really  had to do if I knew  that I would be unpacking and lifting boxes all day and stacking  shelves mopping and  sweeping I would have never took the job
bad,I normally work the night shifts and almost every time I'm working they usually put so much on us that we don't even leave the store until around 11:30pm and we close at 10pm.
bad,Promises of moving up promises of job placement and my own store and promises of better pay $9.25 an hour is hardly enough to pay a bill let alone the bills.
bad,Understaffed.  They have a high turnover of employees.  They do spend money on infrastructure of their DCs.  The building I worked at was very clean.  There is no AP / LP at the DCs or stores.
bad,The store is always a mess. Clothes on the floor.....trash all through the store...you can't walk up an down .stuff is everywhere.  I big fire trap......the store is a mess an junkly.. .. .I go some where else...I first love the store but not now.....
bad,"Previous district manager is horrible example of ""leadership."" He got demoted too late to save my confidence in the operation. "
bad,"Dollar general is a stressful environment from working understaffed and constantly a struggle between key holders and cashiers especially when it comes returns, coupons, and  inventory."
bad,"Under proper management, and proper treatment of employees, has potential to be one of the best places to work for, and was almost that for almost 4 years. While there are those few good stores with good management, most of then are disasters. I was in two good stores under a good manager (at the time) with the help of good assistant managers, until the wool was pulled and about my last year it became a living nightmare when my long-time manager revealed her true colors and conspired with the DM and threw me to the ground. I made two mistakes under pressure from bad management and I got fired after 5 years. I was not given the chance to correct my mistakes, and the DM even suggested that if I lied that I probably would have gotten off, but instead I owned up to my mistakes and was honest, then I got fired. Managers literally get away with murder, and a slap on the wrist while any long-time hourly employee gets thrown to the wolves like they're nothing. I've worked in 18 different stores under many managers. The pay is also very poor and workload is way too much for 1-2 people working at a time. If they required no less than two or more employees, there would be a huge improvement in the stores everywhere. Even the small town stores which usually see great traffic in customers and business, but generally only have one person working. These stores are mini Walmarts and should be  treated as such, not gas stations. There's lots of potential, but most stores do not live up to the potential and the management doesn't even allow it. Before you can put customers first, you gotta put"
bad,"This is most certainly not a company you want to stick around in. Dollar General makes it a point to consistently remind you that you are completely expendable to them, all the while piling up the weekly workload and cutting payroll where they can. You can and will be left alone for upwards of 5 1/2 hours at a time on some days, whether it be from the ever-inconsistent schedules or because a coworker refused to show. You're better than this place."
bad,I have worked on and off for DG since 2014. Two of the stores I worked at promised me Assistant and it never happened.  Pay sucks. Always understaffed and never enough employees on night shift to get everything done. There are times when there is only 1 person working the store which is very dangerous and it’s impossible to get work done. Corporate doesn’t care about employees they just come by to make sure the work is being done and the planograms are set. You have literally sooooo much to do (especially evening shift) but can never get it all done because you are either on register the whole time or being called to the register on and off all night. They should at least have 3 employees every evening to ensure the store is taken care of properly. This is why you see stores that look disgusting  and always have rolltainers and Uboats through the store.
bad,Dollar General is a company that is not interested in investing in its workers or buildings. The store managers have no time for a personal life and the buildings are often in a state of disrepair for long durations of time
bad,I was left alone my first day to run the store and was very understaffed. The store was unclean and disheveled. Safety measures were not being held to.
bad,The store I worked at was terrible! The management was horrible. They want you to do 50 things in 30 minutes while still running the register! HORRIBLE! You don’t get paid enough for what you have to deal with from the customers. 1/10
bad,I loved my job at Dollar General. If the management team wouldve cared about their employees then I would still be there. I had concerns that I personally adressed over and over again with the upper managment and there was never anything done about the problems.The job was not hard at all the hardest part was dealing with the rudeness from the management team and when my boss says to me if DG doesnt come first before ur kids then you dont need to be here then thats when I knew that I had to leave that company. And remeber people dont leave jobs bc of the job people leave jobs because of the upper management. And to top it off I was an Assistant Manager and thats how they treated me.
bad,They miss treat there employees. Not a great company to work for. They have no family values . They do not care about their employees. They are so disrespectful to the employees
bad,All I can say is it’s a paycheck. Over worked and underpaid and not treated fairly most of the time. Definitely wouldn’t recommend working here unless you’re planning on moving all the way up in the company
bad,Ok if you want a part time job. Easy job they will hire anybody. Management is a joke you are just a warm body. If you get a break you still have to stay in the store in case they need you. Work off the clock constantly.
bad,When I first started working for Dollar General everything was fine until the store manger decided to walk out the back door and leave me in the store all by myself on my 3rd day and I was completely unaware until another associate come in wondering where he was then they had found his keys laying in the office with a note. But the job its self was not difficult. Just running the register and putting stock away.
bad,"I was hired as a store manager. Told me I had the same responsibility that I had as a store manager at my other job. But that was a lie. I couldn't hire when I needed people, I couldn't fire someone for stealing, I couldn't write a proper schedule that would benefit to good of the store and it's employees. The DM had to approve. Which took WEEKS!"
bad,"It wasn't always as poor a work environment like it seems be lately. Budget hours for this kind of operation make it impossible to acquire and keep team members as they do not base this on performance. They seem to be trying to grow beyond their capabilities, this has created a lapse in fundamental retail business practices, such as poor inventory control, some very questionable middle management personnel (district level) and major equipment malfunctions with very slow maintenance. This make the workplace very stressful, with the shortage of team members constantly making the salaried individuals (managers) commit to 55-60+ hours to make up for the shortages"
bad,I loved it at first until I got a new manager then. Got treated unfair. Got wrote up for stupid stuff that others did as well like not getting the store removed or finishing truck on time. But I was the only one that got wrote up bc I was assistant manager.  But it's still not fair.
bad,A typical day at work usually starts at 8 am and ends around 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Some days I would close. The hardest part of the job would be constantly standing on concrete floor for me. I really like my coworkers.
bad,"Corporate is out of touch and they control everything from scheduling to what merchandise needs stocked. They hire a small staff and try to stretch about 20 hours a week across 7 people. The pay isn't good, the work can't get done, and the IT system is so archaic and out of date that management has to override the cash register about every 5 to 7 transactions."
bad,Great people but the pay was horrible benefits was horrible and the place itself was not organized appropriately and the place was very cluttered and unsafe. Yu also cant keep nobody there to work
bad,"The pay is not worth it. It's filled with high school type drama, especially with the female workers. The actual hard workers get skipped over for promotion. People like to not come in so its constant double shifts. They make you do things on your lunch break, if you refuse they threaten to write you up. Sometimes you dont even get a break. I feel sorry for the cashiers. They have to stock and run the register while the others are in the back on their phones, taking their sweet time stocking. At closing time, the cashier has to clean the store (fix the shelves, put returns back, sweep and mop, and still run the register) while the keyholder or manager barely fixes the back of the store shelves and counts money. Let's not forget that some of these ""key holders"" and ""managers"" have the cashier do their jobs (meaning cleaning the back shelves AND counting the money and doing the paperwork) while they sit on the phone or smoke cigarettes."
bad,"There is no room for growth. If you get called in on your scheduled days off you better go, or fear of hours being cut drastically. Alot of favoritism & i had to go back and forth between stores weekly."
bad,"They want you to do too much for Soo little pay. "
bad,"To much work expected not enough time to get it done. The store manager is unprofessional, he talks bad about his employees behind their backs. Pay is terrible for the work they expect and no appreciation for good work, only point out the mistakes. I would not recommend anyone working for this horrible company."
bad,The job was an average job with little to no movement opportunities. With Dollar General the work is hard and  precise with little competition for the work done.
bad,"I wouldn’t work here again due to the low pay (minimum wage) and terrible attitude of the manager. I loved everyone I worked w, it made it hard to quit."
bad,"Your life is either Dollar General, or you don’t work at dollar general. You are property, treated decently face to face (in my experience), but overall you don’t get to have mental/physical health problems when you walk in that door. Call off just once and anyone who doesn’t know you, or your work ethic, will be asking if they need to let you go.  Not to mention you are severely underpaid for the amount of work you do. If you want to be JUST a cashier, or JUST a stocker, that will never happen. Oh, and don’t expect your lunches to be uninterrupted, or to even have a lunch. Corporate does try to fix that I will say, but it’s just not going to happen."
bad,"Too much expected for minimum wage or slightly more. Work completion amount never good enough. You can get promoted quickly but only get slight pay increase. Don't recommend unless you need a low wage, over worked job. District manager just wants to intimidate employees."
bad,Come was great at first. Then they keep adding more and more task and no extra payroll or means to complete. You are there by yourself till 3 Or 4 pm everyday . It makes it hard to do anything and control shrink. And keep good store conditions
bad,"It was okay, but pay is little. Not a lot of hours were given. Bad customers. Need to be a person who is customer oriented in order to work here and can tolerate negativity. Standing for 8 hours."
bad,I enjoyed the work. The company policies and scheduling need work. And their raise rates need work. They want their employees to do to much and don't give the stores the hours to complete it in time frame they provide.
bad,Managers are late to work and change schedules with out notification. Then hold employees liable for not knowing the new schedule hours. There just bad managers.
bad,"Left to run the store alone for many hours every day, given a long to-do list, spent my days rushing to and from the register to complete tasks between customers. Failing to finish even one task due to ""serving customers"" is unacceptable, This company expects you to be everywhere at once. Do not work here."
bad,"You can’t move up in a company that shows favoritism. The management team here are ruining the business beauty of the Dollar General Distribution name. Someone really needs to investigate them. Working with my team was great. But, supervisors and management or sneaky little snakes. They are always trying to make themselves look good. Not by providing the amount of people it takes to get the job done or finding the right materials. A very large amount of them are selfish. If there was a way to fix the company instead of harassing their workers about 100% or termination. They  should fire the supervisor and management because they don’t do anything unless their jobs or on the line. It saddens me to say that but the truth hurts.  I’m not being bitter, I just saw how they treat their employees from first hand experience."
bad,Its a bad company to work for they work you like dogs and write you up for small stuff. Its hot in the stores hardly any ac. People are rude customers and the people's who work there.
bad,It was not a good place to work. They make you call other stores to try to get more hours. Management doesn’t work very hard or give good directions.o
bad,This is a difficult company to work due to poor management with unreasonable expectations who will not assist until their higher up is brought in to help
bad,They only have two people working at a time and expect you to get so much done in 4/6/8/10 hours. Between cleaning the store taking care of customers doing the truck and recovering also doing planograms. It's just too stressful and fast-paced for just two people at a time
bad,Dollar General have me working 4 days a week and now they have me work one day a week and some has been taking my money off my card or something or Dollar Generals with me off of money of all the hours I have put in and I give the Dollar General in Chanute at 1
bad,Store managers are treated poorly. They expect too much out of you for the pay. There is NO work/life balance. You are paid for 48 hours a week but it is ALWAYS closer to 60-70 hours per week in which you are not compensated for because you are salary.
bad,"A typical day at work clock in count my drawer,run the register,stock/recover,sweep and mop.What I have learned is customer service and being a cashier.The management was very unprofessional."
bad,"Your first job is obviously not going to be the greatest. It's retail. Dealing with customers is annoying. A woman asked me where the batteries was, I pointed right behind her and she got furious with me because I acted so ""smart"" about it. The real family at your job is your coworkers and they become your battle buddies because you deal with the same stuff every day."
bad,"It's a wonderful work place if management can keep a team however no one would stay employed long enough to have a team Dollar General expects managers and assistant managers to work 60_ 80 hours weekly barely any sleep and disregarding health conditions as long as the job was done...my only problem with being an ASM was no communication with the district managers and no one being on the same page..."
bad,"Workers were expected to restock the store and watch the register. Sometimes there was a second worker out around the store doing more stocking. But often you would be the only one working. The company doesn't give the stores enough hours to properly run, stock and maintain their stores. This leaves the employees feeling overwhelmed for minimum wage. A manager at Dollar General was being paid less than a cashier at Meijer. Just to put things into perspective. Often times employees were fighting against each other to get ahead. Or bitter over someone else not carrying their weight when it came to the workload."
bad,"Expected to work long hours 6 days a week, most of the time you are there by your self.  Not enough hours given to staff the store.  Low salary, and doesn't pay overtime."
bad,"Overall just really low pay and no future put a wedge between myself and dollar general. Also a whole lot of micromanaging from upper management was infuriating, I understand wanting a nice store but something's were just unreasonable."
bad,"The people working here was good, however the management system was poor, keeping the store clean was impossible because of the management system did not reconsecrate people so they made it messy. the pay was poor!!!! nobody can live on 50$ a week!1"
bad,What you can expect from your typical corporate chain of stores. They fenagle and finesse their way around EVERYTHING. they would work me between 20 and 38 hrs a week inconsistantly so they wouldn't have to put me on full time. There's a lot of that type thing.
bad,There are just to many things wrong with the dollar general I worked at. I got my hours cut very often because of my co-workers not doing what they were told to do. I couldn't do there stuff and my stuff in the shift that I had.
bad,Store Managers would quit every month to two months. Store was constantly a mess and cleaned only when inspection would arrive. Long multiple hours with low pay.
bad,"company expects too much from salary employees. Doesn't allow enough payroll to complete task. extremely low pay which creates high turnover and employees aren't properly trained. Hourly employees usually receive 16-20 hours a week, while salary employees are expected to work 60+ and get paid for 40. U have to unload trucks and stock while running a register. Not a very good company to work for"
bad,I find that the new manager is trying to drive everyone out on purpose telling employees that you don’t have to ID other employees even though it’s against policy. She’s writing people up for other people’s mistakes. Just poor management all around
bad,I would not recommend working at dollar general for multiple reasons. I would not recommend working here because the manager and whoever else decides the schedule give employees little to no hours of working per day. If someone is working full time a few hours per week that would not be enough to provide anything.
bad,"Expected to work twice as hard as what they pay you for. Worked for up to 4 hours at a time all alone without being able to use the bathroom or get a break (that's really poor security too, what if I was robbed!?)"
bad,Was not fair at all had favorites and only did everything he could for a group to please them . Every one else was learning things on their own. Upper management never bothered to train new employees.
bad,Dollar general is good for a first time job. If youre in highschool or just need a second job on the side. Would never recommend dollar general as a permanent job. Definitely not a possibility to live financially off of dollar general salary alone.
bad,"I started at Dollar General to make a little bit of extra money. Although I didn’t mind the shorter shifts, it was never enough to ever make any real money and I don’t make enough per hour to make ends meet."
bad,Always very busy and never had a chance to take a break...Manager expected to much from employees because she never wanted to work everything was always about her daughter and granddaughter
bad,"People always stole from this location and the manager was aware of this and allowed this. She was liked in the area and it made the job annoying. She didn't check for IDs appropriately and definitely didn't practice what was in the books. In fact , she didn't train me appropriately and would sometimes leave while on the clock to get her children from school, get lunch, or just to talk to people in the community. The store was always a mess, and she would get annoyed when I asked how to do things she never taught me. I would make it clear to her that I would not bother her from laughing with neighborhood friends if I knew how to do these things. I was always on the cash register while her and her friends who worked there would be joking around eating pizza. The dollar general a few minutes away is a MUCH different environment and is managed accordingly.  I feel bad giving this company a bad review knowing this,but this is my experience."
bad,They could do alot better with their employees and by making it more professional. They also need to step up on their assistant mangers while they play around at work the cashier's do everything else and more .
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years"
bad,"Very quick paced job, you go through employees every month. The manager is rude and argues with customers and employees alike. They expect you to stock a whole rack in one hour every hour, and to run the cash register while doing that."
bad,"This company's only focus is expansion and cutting costs. Practically every store recieves too much product and doesnt recieve enough payroll to ensure that freight is stocked, tasks are completed, store is cleaned, and customers are quickly checked out. You have to sacrifice something  and that is what causes long lines at checkout. Store managers are blamed for every problem by upper management and no praise is given for a job well done. All we hear about is what can  be better. There is no work/life balance. 6 days a week, every week. Take vacation and you fall behind. No time to train employees. The only time you can count on not being bothered at home is after 10pm and the store is closed. Also, most of the customers are trashy. Good luck, there. Would not recommend anybody trying to start a career path with dollar general. This company has grown too fast  and takes itself too seriously."
bad,"It is a good job if you like to always be fast paced and stressed out, the management would always schedule me for AMY day I requested off, even if I asked a month in advance and they also made me (the only employee at our store with small children) work every holiday"
bad,"Working here was okay, at the time I was there the work environment was poor. That is why I did not work there for long. I have nothing against the company however I did not enjoy the management at my store. I am not even sure if they are working there still."
bad,"Terrible to employees. Part-time means there is no minimum requirement for hours for you. I was getting 8 at one store so I transferred to another store that said they had more hours, but then the district manager decided there weren't enough people in case someone called out so they hired 2 additional staff. You have to fight tooth and nail to get 12-15hrs on a regular basis."
bad,The job can be very stressful due to aggressive sales goals and productivity requirements. The pay isn't equitable to the cost of living for most and salaried positions find you at work for 60+ hours every week.
bad,Overall working here is stressful. You are never given enough time to finish what is asked of you and management is poor in my experience. Typically there are only two people on shift at a time no matter what day it is or how busy you are. Management is lazy and unprofessional. Hours are unpredictable and sometimes unfair. For a couple weeks I was given about 15-20 hours a week even though I was in a full time position. Not to mention I was accused of stealing multiple times for doing things like using the “price inquiry” button on the keyboard. I would never recommend anyone get a job here unless you have no other choice.
bad,"If you are considering a job in retail go anywhere that isn't Dollar General because the hours suck, the pay sucks, and if you are in a bad area expect to deal with more thieves than you can deal with."
bad,I liked working at Dollar General in the beginning. But then they started to play favorites all the time. Giving they're favorites more hours an everyone else less an less hours. (myself included)
bad,"The company it'self is okay, but the location I worked for had poor management, I had been promised a better job opportunity and that I could advance within the company, but that didn't actually happen."
bad,"Moved my way up for 10 years, worked in 2 districts and for multiple managers. These people treat their employees terribly. A lot of the store managers are trashy and low class, and have the emotional health of crazy ex-girlfriends. A lot of the store managers are lazy too, but DMs never fire them. We get a new  DM every 6 months, as a result of that failure to hold Store Managers accountable. These people do not work as teams or families. They do anything they can to sabotage each other and don't usually benefit from it. This company no longer promotes based on skill or hard work. They expect store managers to work a minimum of 48 hrs a week, which most DO NOT. Assistants work 30-40hrs a week and pick up a large amount of the slack for those who do not work but still receive salaries"
bad,They require management to work a lot of hours and the pay just isn't enough for the work that is required. Six day workweeks and a very heavy workload...
bad,My hours were up and down. Never set schedule. Worked my butt off to be a key holder like asked and my position was given to a new person that had only been there three days. You have to be in good with the manager to get treated decent.
bad,I hated my job it was very much not a job that cared about its employees. it became a very hostile work place for me and my supervisor did not like me at all
bad,"Dollar General needs to appreciate employees more and store management needs to improve. Dollar General needs to work on being a fair workplace. With this being said, race should not play a part in workload in the workplace."
bad,dollar general is not a place to work if you want to accomplish much. there is no room for growth and the district managers do not care for the employees
bad,"Dollar General only cares about the bottom line even when they say different. The first DM was awesome and took time to help. When he was transfered , the new DM was racist and very unprofessional. I gave 3 weeks notice and HR said it was up to my DM in which he refused my vacation time that I had left and it was lost. At that point he informed me if I was going to quit I needed to just go ahead and quit. I did per his instructions."
bad,I can go back but last option. I was lied to and worked the wrong way to help there company MISTREATED AS A WOMAN MANAGER.  Not enough hours to get a orderly store clean
bad,I think that it was a good place to work for but they need to pay closer attention to their employees who are managing the store locations who does the hiring an firing an does payroll entry cause in my experience they abused their position an made dollar General stores  look bad
bad,"Productive company with the right management"
bad,"Pay was not fair or reasonable,"
bad,You only get a 0.25 cent raise every year. your hours are bound to be cut due to the managers district managers requests. They don't care about your safety or security at these stores. they just want u to work and work. Its almost impossible to make a living off of this job unless you are a manager.
bad,"too much to do with the time allowed to get it done, seniority means nothing to them. The hardest workers were never recognized, learned that working hard and caring about the job and work never mattered to anyone."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job at Dollar General is working with the customers. Nothing is better than seeing the smile on their faces when finding a product that they are looking for.
bad,"The management never did any work, I was expected to do everything except the manager duties of counting the safe and paper work. The worked me like an animal for very little benefits."
bad,This job is way too stressful.  I am too stressed when i go into work and i usually have my attacks because i get sick every time I walk into the building.
bad,"I got hired on as a assistant manager thinking I was going to do everything that managers do (hire, fire, payroll, schedules, etc.) Never happened I feel like I'm just like the cashiers no authority at all the store manager never taught me any manager duties or task except to stock shelves and change price tags!! I'm full time but every week I'm scheduled with part time hours. The store manager is very hard to get in contact with.. the pay is horrible not enough hours or pay to get a decent check being that I had one of the highest position at the store... it's just not a great place to work especially if you have Bills!!!"
bad,"They shill their stocks and stores to employees. "
bad,"You either got a lot of hours or you didnt get any hours. There is never a decent schedule. The pay was not what an assistant manager should get paid, especially running the store without a manager for months."
bad,"Loved my job but no my manger. Would ask for time off and I couldn't get it ,would ask for more hours and I couldn't get it ask to but transfer to other stores and he wouldn't do it so I left"
bad,"They train you the way that Dollar General expects but that does not match what is actually performed. The corporate offices did not care, as long as the doors were open and money was being made."
bad,"the job was an okay job , I just hated doing the cash register work. I learned how to work a cash register good. I liked stocking though. The best part was the breaks"
bad,A typical day of work would Consist of stocking or cashiering and I learned how to stock cashier and multitask and the management is alright but the benefits are kinda bad actually and the workplace culture is a family oriented and now the hardest part of about the is no overtime at all you don’t get paid 1times 1/2 you are paid regular pay with no vacation time at all and the scheduling to work is horrible the most enjoyable part about is getting paid and leaving  honestly.
bad,"Management could be way better. Days are always busy  No matter what you do its not good enough. Way short handed, lots of customer complaints because of that. If they could get their stuff together and keep GOOD people working, that store would be ok"
bad,They have a long list of things they expect you to do while also trying to watch the cash register which is not realistic. I would often times be in charge of stocking the shelves and also having to run the cashier and would not get my carts done in the amount of time they wanted. They do not pay enough for all that they expect you to do. Breaks are short. Company policies are harmful sometimes and employees have to bear the brunt of mad customers due to this.
bad,"Most of the people(women) who work there are very rude to both custumers and coworkers. There is constant gossiping and clear favoritism from the manager. Additionally there are way too many cigarette breaks being taken by several workers, as well as unfair workloads being put on productive associates by lazy associates who wish to do less work than is expected."
bad,I loved working at Dollar General because my store was a neighborhood store  so I seen a lot of the same faces everyday so I was able to build relationships with my customers. The downfall with dollar general Is the fact that they still pay their employees $7.25. Nobody can live off of that especially part time. At the time I was working there I was going to school and living with my parents. my check every week literally went to gas and food. If I would have had to pay bills then there no way I would have made it.
bad,Depends on who the manager is how work gets done and who has to work. some managers will work and some dont and willl put all the workload on everyone else.
bad,"I had a horrible store manager. She was never on time, when she did show up she left early. She also set several of her employees up to be fired for stealing but she is the one that took money."
bad,There's no teacher like LIFE!!! EXPERIENCE IS PRICELESS!!! Try and learn something new everyday and remember to starve the negative and feed the positives in life...
bad,This is not a job i wound recommend to anyone. It is a bad company that does not care at all about it's employed. ......................................
bad,Company rather have a high turnover than work with managers and staff to increase success. They rather hire a lot of people but they will not give you the hours to support your shifts. Assistant managers are given less hours than team members.
bad,"I ran the register, cleaned balanced register and prepare night deposits, cleaned store , stocked.  I did all that was needed but was very unhappy with the lack of professionalism."
bad,"reconciling ending balances"
bad,There was a great deal of work at SM. Too much was expected for the amount they were paying. Corporate management was always rude when they came in for visits. Never greeted all of my employees who worked hard weekly. The job was very demanding and the hours were crazy.
bad,Management needs to be trained on how to manage employees. Management talks down to employees and treats them like trash. Required classes on management and safety need to be took on a quarterly basis.
bad,"The managers are overworked and the employees are intentionally scheduled less than 40 hours so no benefits have to be offered, such as paid time off, insurance, etc. I worked there almost 3 years and if i wanted to take extended time off (vacation) I didn't get a paycheck for my week of vacation. They are open on Thanksgiving and it is mandatory that everyone work that day."
bad,"According to a union leader, Labour Department officials, including the Joint Labour Commissioner (JLC), advised the workers to resume work and assured them ... The production in Royal Enfield's Oragadam factory was halted completely, while its facility ..."
bad,Not enough people on shift for desired wants of management and not an efficient enough system to give better  service to all customers. The benefits were that we got paid weekly
bad,More policing than working. Management is no good. Always revolving with new employees. Not loyal or considerate to employees. Don't know how to balance life and work
bad,High turnover rate for management. Complaints and violations are not taken seriously. Salaried workers don't work full shifts and instead rely on hourly workers to complete their work for them. Don't pay their workers a living wage.
bad,"They look for any and every reason they can find to fire someone.  High turn over, they can't keep good help. The district manager is a HUGE c0cksucker.  They don't help you learn things the right way or give you multiple conflicting answers to your questions. Then they fire you."
bad,"I learned money managemnet."
bad,"I enjoyed the work. However, the management was inconsistent and unorganized. I learned a lot from my time with Dollar General about customer service."
bad,Great people to be around but unfortunately not in a work environment it was all play no work. Manager's were being way too comfortable with customer's or rude
bad,The lack of decent management in the district level and sm position was a problem with this company. Shifts are poorly scheduled to the extend that there are times you are alone in the store.  The hours are not consistent and their is no loyalty to employees
bad,"The allotted hours the store managers are given are not enough to run the store efficiently without overworking the store manager who is on salary.  "
bad,"Work/Life balance is hard to achieve as a manager. The daily/weekly expectations are on a deadline, even if you have positions to fill and are covering missed shifts yourself. There are limited fluctuating hours to distribute to your employees, this can cause employee turnover. Upper management was quick to point out problems, but slow to acknowledge or ignored requests for support. There is no room for individual management, DG simply wants a body to execute the to-do list."
bad,"Shows you what the real world is like, but poor management. Good breaks and hours. Some nice people. Sometimes have to work weekends and holidays. Kinda good pay as well."
bad,Just felt it was to much for just 2 people to handle.  If the manager close they bring in extra help.  But I had to close just one person. They would always say they're going to write you up for any and every thing.  As a key Carrier there is only so much one person can do with no help.
bad,"an easy job with very nice coworkers and a nice environment, decent breaks and decent work schedule, very flexible. i liked the job but it’s not enough for me"
bad,"If you like working in an environment where you don't get much help, this is the place for you! More than likely you will be the only employee working while there might be one manager there to assist you."
bad,The job itself was not bad.  Typical retail and cashier position requirements.  Poor management and scheduling made it more stressful than it should have been.
bad,Lost the way in regards to caring for both the customer and the employees. Enjoyable-Fellow employees and customers. Used to be a great place for both customer and employees.
bad,Worked six to seven hours a week a minimum of 10 hour work day. Also expected to be on call. Typical work day would be with only two other employees for highest volume store in central Arkansas.
bad,The manager is wonderful but the company sucks. They think all customers and workers are theifs and demand your purse to be searched every time you leave. Also they expect you to throw freight like crazy and have unachievable expectations at how much can get done in a day.
bad,"I rate them a 3. I enjoyed working for the store, but had a problem with new manger that was there when I was forced out. Didn't want to leave, but had to."
bad,"Enjoyed the time with customers, Hated the long hours and the heavy lifting and cleaning, most times it was only one employee in the store, to run the front and stock and clean"
bad,"I worked at dollar general for about 10 weeks and it seemed to be a very tense work environment when the store manager was in she didn't want to take the time to make sure i knew what i was doing she preferred to just move me out of the way and do it herself for the closing shift which would be the shift i worked most of the time roughly 7 and a half hours including my 30 minute lunch everything felt like we werw rushed to get the store swept and mopped stock things like our 20 oz. Sodas the beer the bread milk and cigarettes in a matter of 30 minutes along with all of the things customers decided they didnt want, which most of the time was a cart full of items we managed to get everything done by the end of the night although we had 2 people working an associate and a key holder which is one of the shift managers hours were unsteady some weeks i would have 30+ and other weeks I would have 6"
bad,"the summary says it all. My manager was the only one in the chain of command who cared to help with any injustices done, however when they fell ill and as the next under them that could take the store I was left high and dry. no matter how high I climbed on the chain of command no one would hear or help, no one had time or cared."
bad,the summary says it all. I was unhappy most of my employment with Dollar General. No matter how high I went on the chain of comand list no one wanted to hear or help with any problems that arose.
bad,It’s an okay job if you love working with people and you have to be a people person very verbal and consistent and fair sociable and welling to work with othets
bad,"I was the store manager and on salary."
bad,I learned how to use money machine. How to call bank to call for certain amount of money. Also help customers. Gotten better at customer service skills
bad,I found the dollar general sore that I worked at to be an abysmal experience. The manager was a character that placed their own desires before the workers needs and company rules.
bad,Underpaid and stressful work environment and unfair. Impossible to manage a truly successful store as the company doesn't put money back into their stores or take care of their employees. This company is all about expanding rather than focusing on what is. Forget about a personal life if you are a manager because you will basically live at your store to keep up with standards.
bad,"Unorganized,  too much drama and lack of communication. The schedule was flexible. The work ethic sucks. Alot of the employees have a misunderstanding with each other."
bad,The manager was the only thing my location's Dollar General had going for it. The hours were slow-paced and boring and the people I worked with just did not care. I decided it was in my best interest to leave to pursue better opportunities.
bad,"This job has been difficult for my mental health. You are expected to do more than physically possible. There are very little hours disbursed to the employees. The company does not treat its employees with respect. Things that are reported to corporate are not confidential, even though they are supposed to be."
bad,"rapid changes to management due to district managers, trained many managers for assistant manager pay, for the last manager that became the actually manager of the store wanted to clean us all out so began threatening to let us go over ridiculous things, I knew it was my time to go but she didn't allow me to traspher out as a manager, so I gave up trying"
bad,"I think everyone should have an experience in retail, just to show them what the workers go through and how having to deal with the public is usually miserable. Maybe more individuals would behave differently or treat retail workers with more kindness. With that said it's a decent High School job but I wouldn't want to work there the rest of my life."
bad,"if you need gas money every week this is the job for u.Do not expect to make enough to support your family because even with full time hours which is(25-32)-by dollar general standrds,You wouldnt make it.The key holders and managers make mininum."
bad,"I worked at a distribution center, day shift, starting at 6 am and scheduled to work until 4pm with one week day off and the weekends off. However, we usually worked until 5:30 or 6:00 pm most days to get all the days' orders filled. This was in both departments I worked in: repack and non-cons (non conveyables). Often I had to work my weekday instead of having it off, due to the supposedly heavy work load, but the dept. supervisor had favorites and if they wanted their weekday off, they got it. If a scheduled holiday fell in the work week, we were scheduled to work the Sunday before or after the holiday to make up the time, being told, ""we have to support the stores."" The money was good, but working all the time, how can one enjoy it, or ones' life or family? It also gets old going to work in the dark and getting off in the dark day in and day out. The work is very physical and fast paced. It's all to a quota, and if you don't meet their numbers, they write you up, too many write-ups and you're fired. I wouldn't work there again for twice the money."
bad,I would rather not even waste my time nor effort writing about and honest work day/shift at Dollar General! I am one who simply wishes the company can and will do better.
bad,"I really don't have to regurgitate every other bad review about the company you'll find here, it's all the same. Bad Hours, Bad Management, Bad training, bad everything. If it wasn't fr up and coming high school workers, this place probably wouldn't be in business with how often employees change due to sub par standards."
bad,Dollar General was alright to work for once I learned how to do every thing. They didn't really teach me any thing on how to do things though. Some co-works help show or tell me what I need to do but others did not.
bad,The general manager took zero consideration for the lack of employees in the store and would not allow the manager of the store to hire any new people even though we were severely short staffed.
bad,"Dollar General was the most stressful management position that I have ever held.  Managers go in at 4 or 5A.M. and may not go home until 11PM.  To have a family and work as a salaried manager, it is nearly impossible"
bad,"you run a register if no one is in the store you stock shelves"
bad,"Hours are inconsistent and may have to work back to back shifts (i.e closing shift into a morning shift) eliminating any time for restful sleep. Stores are typically run with 1-2 employees making for a stressful environment especially during a rush. Management can be hit or miss, but usually nothing great. The pay is not proportional to the speed of the work load (I made $8.75 as a lead associate as opposed to $10.50 as a janitor for a different company). The only good thing about this company is that you're likely to get hired if you apply."
bad,"Help set up stores and was a cashier was promised advancement.found another job, then they wanted to advance me.I would be a good first-time job I suppose for younger people looking, but no future there...Stepping stone job"
bad,"there is no good reason to work here unless its that you need a job, it is poorly ran from corporate on down to local management . I am looking to leave here as soon as possible"
bad,"It wasn't hard but it's your typical cashier/stockperson job. Nothing special really. It got robbed once, but I didn't work there then."
bad,"The company did not seem to care about their employees. There were instances of physical assault from customers to the employees that were not addressed properly and the individuals  were not even given a break to deal with the confrontation that had happened; furthermore attempting to defend ones self would result in termination. On the bright side, the store location that I worked with was happy to work with schedules and falling sick. There is room for promotion and the opportunity arises often. coworkers in most locations are very friendly. Myriad of tasks to perform; you will be able to perform many different tasks and will likely not be bored easily."
bad,horrible store manager. great assistant manager. needed more help. had to stock as well as cashier. enjoyed visiting with customers. pretty easy job though overall
bad,"My direct manager was great, however the HR Department is a joke! Things that were suppose to be kept confidential were not, and soon everyone knew your personal business t. They give warnings, and write ups to the employees they want to, sometimes double finals and others they don't. There should be some consistency with the way things are handled."
bad,A lot of problems with the registers breaking down a lot of customers complaining about it . Only two people working a whole store through out the day.
bad,Very long work weeks and a bad turnover rate. The pay is Ok but a lot is required. It’s a great way to develop vendor relations. The customers are great and make the job rewarding.
bad,Working at dollar General was a good experience. The lack of staff was the only issue I faced. Lack of staff called for extremely long work days and no days off.
bad,Frequent purges and a patronage system make this a stressful place to work. Poor management decisions frequently lead to long hours and extra days that are unnecessary. The work is fairly demanding and you are constantly moved from area to area and have no set schedule you can plan your life around. Rules and procedures are changed almost daily on a whim.
bad,"The manager I worked for relocated to a new store. Two of the Assistant Managers/Senior individuals have also left the store. "
bad,There are not a lot of payroll hours to run the store properly. So being salary if you want things done you have to work open to close the SIX days you are required to work. Then there is the convienient text or phone call of a visit. ON YOUR ONE DAY OFF. Like they don’t already know it’s your day off.
bad,Working there I never got to see my family I had to do so many 5am-10pms because no one else would work went without days off missed seeing my kids sometimes a week straight
bad,"I work at dollar General in Sharpsburg n its so dirty , the pay is low and they give keys to anyone who apply n get hired b's hours they don't pay u for not taking your lunch"
bad,The summary is basically a perfect understanding. This company has virtually no understanding of respecting and compensating it's employees. The only time a person should consider working for this company is as a part timer. Full-timers and managers have ridiculous expectations with little to no satisfaction or compensation.
bad,They were very unprofessional. Not to mention they wanted me to work during a hurricane and a power outage. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"not much to say about this place they tell you that you get all this and that ,but the pay really is not good and some of the managers there are rude to the employees and the DM doesn't want to listen to the employees when there is a problem with the manager,it is always your fault and they don't want to hear you."
bad,This is not a good company to work for. They waste thousands of dollars on adverting and sponsor ships and refuse to give employees regular raises while still expecting them to work long and demanding hours.
bad,"I love working with the public."
bad,"What is there to be said that hasn't been said a thousand times before about a starting retail job? Bad pay, rude customers, no benefits, bad hours, something you work til you can go somewhere else"
bad,"I worked at the Dollar General in Stephenville, Tx while attending school there. The Hours were inconsistent, the manager would show up 8-12 hours late for her shift, she was rude and just a nightmare to work with."
bad,"Definitely not the place to be if your trying to earn a living and support a family. Pay is low, $7.25 an hour to start no matter your experience , getting only a 25 cent raise a year. Asking for a higher raise falls on deaf ears with the typical corporate answer of “It’s not in the budget”. Hours are terrible as well, part timers only receiving 15 to 20 hours a week, if your in the store managers favor. If not, expect about 8 to 12 hours a week.  The whole business model of DG is to make money for share holders, at the detriment of its hourly employees. The only way I could recommend working at DG is if your strapped for cash and need a 2nd job to make some extra money.  Working here will require a second job anyways."
bad,"would not recommend working here if you expect to have any type of family life, hours are terrible, stores are very poorly staffed and upper management only cares about profit"
bad,"This job is so stressful. If you are a manager, you do not get actual breaks and are not even allowed to leave the store. The hours are awfully inconsistent - you go from working 10-11 hour days to 4-hour shifts. They often expect you to close the store then open it the next morning. You are always exhausted and stressed out, and if you ever get a day off they are blowing up your cell phone asking you to cover shifts at other stores. Great job at first, but it really wears you down after a while. Not a job I would want to do long-term."
bad,They do not promote anyone older than 50.... I was let go with 250 other people for no reason. They made me sign a paper saying it was not because of my age but I was in my 50's at the time.
bad,We were unorganized and I felt targeted. You really can't schedule things in your regular life because they never got the schedule out in time. I felt stressed everyday I worked there. Even in really harsh weather it seemed the higher up people only cared about making money and not the safety of their store employees.
bad,The management was poor and expected the new workers to be cashier and work while manager and assistants smoked outside a lot  there was no help at all and very rude customers about how messy the store was
bad,"the job and life balance is just not there, management does not care if you have to work 70 or 80 hours a week and not see your family, they will just not help. The payroll given to the stores is a joke is too low for the amount of freight coming from the warehouse and management complains why stockrooms are full. Warehouse does not help they will send 5 boxes of an item you dont really sell, but the one you do sell the just sent out 1 box, that also ties in with the in stock which they require stores to be mostly in stock but dont matter what you order warehouse still sends you whatever they feel like sending in."
bad,"The management was never there to help. If you paged them, they never came up. Customers would have to leave and come back later to do returns because I couldn't do them. They never wanted to give me days off and made me work before my prom and my graduation party."
bad,The atmosphere there was always negative and there was so much gossip that went around about every co-worker. It was just not a fun time when you are at work and you always are checking the clock when you are ready to go.
bad,If you are thinking about  being a Store Manager for Dollar General Do Not think you will EVER get a day off!! You must work Six Days a week and on your Day Off they will call you NON-STOP. JUst rethink your life choices...
bad,"I loved the customers and the staff.  However, the company itself is very greedy and I didn't feel as though they really cared about their employee's."
bad,You work too hard only to be paid not more than 10.50 an hour as an assistant manager. After a year you may get a raise however it is NOT guaranteed. It is too hard for your body to keep up and upper manager does not care about health.
bad,I would never recommend a job at DG.  They dont treat their employees fairly and make you work lots of hours to get things done that never get done in a timely manner
bad,This is  a good company to work for if they had the right people to manage it.the co worker are great but The store was always mess up I really don't have more to say
bad,Short hours stocking and unloading trucks for just 7 dollars a hour on Fridays through Sunday I learned to stay positive even with the lack of management and coworkers the hardest part is the only one working while others stand there and last the most enjoyable was just being motivated to keep working as hard as I could for the company
bad,"Scheduling is unfair, co workers are ok don’t do their work, management is favorable to their own needs, pay is too low and not worth the time that gets sacrificed"
bad,If you have a family at home don't bother working here. They don't pay overtime and will work you as many hours as possible. Be prepared to work your butt off.
bad,Everyday was a different learning experience at Dollar General. The public abused the store and the staff was underpaid and expected to do a lot. It was very stressful
bad,"Unfortunately during my time working with Dollar General, I had a poor connection with the management, wish pushed me away from my employer. A solid 5 months into my employment I started to get sick while working. I would still do my job while on the clock and at most times do more than what was asked. But, I did miss a couple of days due to finding out I was pregnant and gave the store at least twelve hours notice of when I was not going to be able to make it in. Even if I made up my hours by going in for a coworker, there was never any one able to cover for my shift when I needed their help. When I was hired on I also started to realize most of my coworkers were related and able to switch shifts easily amoungst one another. One manager had been taking excessive days off and nobody ever complained once. I loved my job and the customers that came in on a regular basis and hated leaving but the management was intolerable."
bad,Hours were bad. I was lucky to make 100$ per week just to get by. I spent more money in gas to get there then what it was worth for the pay. I don't recommend job
bad,there is too much expected for what they pay. they want you sweaty and barely able to breasthe after busting your butt for $8.90-9.40/hr. super stressful as well
bad,"Typically you would come in count out your drawer, begin cashing out customers. During your shift there is a check list of things to be completed. Stocking items from the truck was expected also. The manager would change your schedule without any warning."
bad,"First thing when I got there went in start putting all the racks outside in front of store that was for display.  Then after that I would go and ,start putting up stock ,mainly groceries and then I thought got the groceries.I would do the bath and body ,then if there was any clothes I would do the clothes and shoes .  I learned how to do displays ,price changes ,the register, unload the delivery truck.   Learned how to do plan a grams that was one of my favorite .  Management was OK but , it could've been better . I get along with all cultures.  The hottest part of the job was unloading the truck.  The most fun I had there was actually putting stock up I actually enjoyed that ."
bad,"The management blatantly favored personal friends in work hours and hiring while shifting blame for mistakes onto employees that were not favored, often times completely disregarding the underlying problem that caused the issue in the first place. When questioned on the productivity of the store hours were often cut as a result. The other employee not involved in management were often pleasant and easy to work with. There is no particular part of the job that is difficult so as long store procedures are followed work can get done easily."
bad,I love my team I love most of my customers. Corporate does not care about us at all. We are over worked and so underpaid. Corporate and our district managers expect us to break our backs for this company with hardly any pay with hardly any days off all on a very low salary for 60+ hours a week.
bad,"Dollar General's main focus is getting freight out. They don't care about the employees. Store managers can take off for whatever reason but its an issue when the workers need to take off for something. If you have kids or a life outside of work, this might not be a good place to work because the schedule is inconsistent and its hard to plan activities around it. The pay is not enough for the work you're required to do."
bad,"The job itself was simple, easy and enjoyable, however i found the time limit for certain tasks was unreasonable and difficult with only a staff of 1 or 2 people. This job was very demanding and left me little time with family as i was working 6 days a week and no vacation days. I worked every weekend unless requested and was treated poorly by some of the other staff. I would not recommend working here again, however i did learn some valuable skills as a manager here as well as problem solving skills. I left due to moving."
bad,Stressful place to work but great people. They put a lot on you even if you're just part time. They don't explain the job well enough before they hire you .
bad,"Dollar General Warehouse was basically a huge sweat shop. You had a start time but no end time daily. Difficult to maintain a work/life balance. Working overtime all the time burns you out. Not worth the money if you have no time to do anything else, to include spend time with your family."
bad,"Promise one thing get something else, Co- workers are good, Customers are nice, lot of work, low hours with very low pay, poor training, Big turnovers. It's the company! They expect a lot of work for very low pay, long as they have a body to cashier, stock, clean.....or you can quit! they don't care, just hire someone else! They need to increase the pay scale and appreciate their employees. To many good people are leaving!  Pay them right, treat them right.. they stay."
bad,I lost pay over time and rules increased overtime and sooner our later was just to much for such a small pay. I got no benefits and felt the work was not worth the time I put into it.
bad,everything was ok until we got a new store manager I am a diabetic and I came to work at 12pm she made me wait to go on my lunch break at 8pm my sugar got low before that and I could not run register anymore.
bad,"The pay is 7.50 an hour.  They only give you about 25 hours a week. "
bad,It is a very good job for kids who want to start working around 16 to 18 during high school. Very productive business. You stay busy pretty much the whole time.
bad,"Not a fun place to work, work load is more than normal retail due to limited employment. Management does absolutely nothing but sit in there office.  Early mornings for days you get shipments."
bad,"Working here started out great, but slowly became a chore, which isn't unlike a lot of jobs. But the hours were too much, even when I had requested morning shifts, I was given full weeks of nights. The management was rude, unprofessional, and seemed to slowly start to dislike me personally which blended into the work environment."
bad,need better training on the job and better communication with others. managers need to train better on the job about how to recover the store and clean the store during the day Shifts and Night shifts
bad,"work load is overwhelming never enough staff,turn over is high due to pay,upper management is none existent in supporting its managers, shoplifters are overly aggressive"
bad,"I had worked at Dollar General for over a year and I had a terrible experience with this job as the hours were constantly inconsistent and the wages were low.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers, while the easiest part was scanning the items. The environment at Dollar General was often dangerous due to lack of security being put in the store."
bad,"A typical day at work I take care of the floor such as unloading truck, stocking shelves, and helping customers. "
bad,"No work life balance, job culture stinks, work all weekends and there was a time when being a DM was awesome and now its more work and less pay, with no balance to enjoy your family"
bad,"I loved my customers at Dollar General. Me and the managers did not get alone they did not clean up after themselves, they expected me to clean up after them."
bad,I worked a lot of hours to get the store up to my standards. It was almost there but then I got robbed at gun point  I had to work so I went back.  it took me along time to not be scared to work there and then it happened again   I had to get out
bad,wasn't enough employees to run the store. Always problems with management. Would only have one line open for check out and it was always the 10 items or less and customers were always complaining.
bad,A typical day at work was hard. You will be expected to complete a certain amount of duties in only a minimum amount of time given the fact that the employee's where only given a certain amount of hours.
bad,At first I loved working there i moved up very quickly from key holder to assistin manager hrs were good the last time management was changed hrs were cut to 14 a week my last yr there wasn't a good experience
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of me cleaning up messes customers made and standing at the register all day long ringing up customers. While working there, I was able to learn some management skills. The management was some of the worst I have ever been under. There was very poor communication and often times the lack of communication would cause problems in the workplace. The hardest part of my job was staying put all day long and the most enjoyable part was learning how to manage a store."
bad,"If you want to have your manager to demean you over months of working with her and treating you like you are nothing. Then that is the place for you."
bad,I would start my day at 5 a.m not to finish until 9 p.m I worked lots of hours and was underpaid and at the end I was robbed during Thanksgiving holidays so I decided to make a change in my career.
bad,"Lousy pay, no real hours, and no benefits. It was a decent place to work, but you should not be a local to work there. Coworkers willing to give you some of their hours, but not willing to take yours if you need help."
bad,A typical day was opening/closing store. Upper management and employees not trust worthy. Hardest part was DM and management. Culture was horrible. People stealing daily. Got robbed.
bad,Constantly understaffed. Management did nothing but sit in the office. Store's disorganized. Wanted me to do basically everything while also attending to customers.
bad,"Decent job, some good coworkers.  Manager wasn't the greatest.  Talked about other employees all the time, not very professional.  Asst Manager was a decent guy, good at his job.  Pay could definitely be better for all the things you do."
bad,the company does not care about their employees. they would rather hire new instead of take care of the hard working people they already have. i wish it would have worked out but it didn't.
bad,Usually we were over stock and very unorganized. the management would give every task to the new hires. I don't have much to say it was just a very horrible experience.
bad,"I did not get paid much, but had to do others jobs as well as mine. I was not trained well my first day and was left alone by another employee, but our manager was great"
bad,Day at work was out going fast pace. stocking inventory was very organized.I learned alot how to work the cash register that was really fun.over all the store was well taken care of.
bad,It was a great job just need more pay an more hours an a better manger an some security  at the store at all Times. An how to make sure all employee got the Same amount of hours
bad,"Not a job I would recommend as this company does not appreciate it employees and does not pay well. This is a fast paced, hard working, stressful, with no gratitude for it employees."
bad,A typical day at work was it always busy. I learned that know matter how busy it get during the day you should always wear a smile. Being in management was good because I am a leader. There was really no hard part about my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around people especially when they was friendly.
bad,It was a job and good place to work but not enough hours and the pay should be a lot better than what it is. Everyone deserves more than $7.25 Hr. The good part about the job was meeting  people and helping them. The bad part was not enough money or hours.
bad,"If you're a cashier, you have to keep up with stock (which 90% of it consists of overstock) and the registers, which is harder to do if your store is small and overrun with stocking carts. There's not much training, and (my store, at least) communication relies on a landline that your manager may or may not care about. My first manager was nice and actually cared about my well-being, however she was moved and the next one didn't care at all. She didn't care about me going to school the next day (kept me past midnight), didn't care about my mental well-being, or any real complaint I had."
bad,"Fast paced and barely get breaks (cashier)"
bad,Great place at first. Upper mgmt changed and everything went downhill. No common sense or logic. Constantly cut labor to show profit and expected SM to work extra cause we were salaried.
bad,"My manager was amazing. My co-workers was amazing....besides one who was a power hungry but lazy bum. "
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for 2+ years and over all I would say they are a very selfish company. The people in the corporate office are treated great, but the people actually working hard and making the money in the stores are not cared for so well. They pay cheap and do not respect their employees. It is easy to work your way up to key holder or assistant manager but that is because your pay doesn't change much."
bad,Needs some improvement in corporate. Little pay when they expect you to do everything and fill in for a salaried store manager and do all she does with barely any hours to work with.
bad,"Overall,would not recommend this place to work for it is draining mentally because it's rarely busy, the manager is not easy to talk to and makes you feel guilty for calling off, no matter the reason. I dreaded going in every day."
bad,"If you can't stand and move for long periods of time then this is not the job for you. Long hours, strenuous work.... Safety is not the first priority, numbers are. Over turn managers and supervisors more than employees, management team has no clue how to run anything. Job is constantly threatened. They have no respect for you and nothing is ever good enough. The only good thing is the money is great and also the benefits and the people. Would I recommend to anybody no.... Just make sure this is what you want before you apply.... And last thing they half train you... You're lucky to get two days before they throw you to the wolves."
bad,Can work as a temp with felony's but not full time.  It seems redundant to work extremely hard for a short period of time. There is a lack of unity an team work in the shipping department. There are many things that could be improved if it wasn't a numbers driven department
bad,"This job can be grueling. I worked my way up from a cashier to assistant manager within a matter of months. The pay was not dramatically different even though the responsibilities were. As a cashier, you are expected to stock the shelves, clean, and ring up customers at the same time!! There is often just a cashier and a manager working every shift which puts pressure on the cashier if the store gets busy. Working there, I did learn the importance of team work and of putting in a hard day of work. I liked to see progress of the store being organized and clean. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customers. I am a people person."
bad,"Corporate does not care about the employees! since I've been an employee I have seen people leave because of the way the company treats their workers! The company has a ridiculously high turn over rate because of the pay and expectations! The pay is not correlating with the amount of work expected. As a manager, I have been robbed of money that I deserve because of my work ethic and experience! When I try to get answers on concerns that I have, it always takes a week or longer to get a response!"
bad,"I won't speak for all Dollar General but personally the one I worked at was not in good condition and poor service and management. But, however I tried to enjoy the little time that  I had."
bad,Made sure shelves were neatly stocked with labels facing outward for easier browsing. Operated cash register while greeting customers entering the store and helped them locate the items they needed.
bad,"this retail employer requires total open availability, but does not provide hours, or timely schedules to employees, Expectations of employees are set unreasonably high, and compensation, and recognition is the lowest for any retail chain I have ever heard of."
bad,It is an okay place to work if the store has a decent staff that works as a team.  Store was neat and organized but staff was not suitable.  Not to mention that the environment was to relaxed.
bad,"Working for Dollar General was very rewarding, yet very stressful. "
bad,I never really had any problems with my job. I wouldn't want anyone trying to make an career out of it at all. If you want a summer job this is the best place for you.
bad,"I worked here for a year in Darien Ga.  It was very disorganized and they never knew what was going on.  I got called in all of the time to work.  I worked 40 hours a week and still got paid hourly minimum wage.  Just, no."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General, however, the manager I worked under and several of the assistant managers were difficult to work with. My favorite part of working there was the people I got to meet every day. and the hardest part of the job for me was the expectations they had of their employees."
bad,"I worked mainly on the floor, receiving truck and placing merchandise on the floor, as well as, stocking. I also worked register. It was a very busy store where you had to be able to multi task.It was your typical retail environment dealing with customers and their requests. The management in some of the store had to many chiefs or not enough associates almost always understaffed which it made it harder to get some of the assignments on time. I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with some of the customers, I also enjoyed doing the opening and closing  paperwork. They taught me how to manage the bank deposit and counting of the tills as part of the closing duties."
bad,"Great for a two income family trying to make extra money.  convenient area for lots of business. work load is easy, some employees are lazy, and not friendly."
bad,"No respect, no confidence, no security and no help! Just outrageous! Lack of cooperation and communication between management. Most enjoyable part of the whole job was the day I walked out."
bad,"Routinely go through managers and employees. "
bad,"The most greedy company I have ever worked for. Not everyone's experience is like mine, however, most people would agree with this. I was here for years and it just kept getting worse by the week. Long hours never end. Horrible management decisions that have no practical logic. Company does not run smoothly. Morale is low. They blame employees for everything and rarely show appreciation for good work. Pay is the only thing here that is a positive."
bad,I'm not saying the job is hard but for what little they pay vs all the work you have on your plate isn't worth it. It's manager work for less pay than a Walmart cashier or a McDonald's sales associate.
bad,"you will have no life if you are a manager. expected to perform as manager as well as cashier, while trying to make sure truck is completed in specified time frame, and follow a 7day work flow. they want you to work with only 3 or 4 total staff. tell you they only want you to work 55 hours a week, but you are lucky if you only work 70-80 hours a week. they expect you to hire responsible staff on minimum wage and at most, most regular staff get 15-20 hours a week. overall, this is not a place to work if you want a life, only work for Dollar General if you have no life and want to live in the store."
bad,The workplace it's-self was okay. but the personal relationships with others there were strained due to rumors and such.
bad,"I loved my job but as the months went on the work load was impossible for one manager to handle, and no hours given to the store for productivity to get done in a timely manner, The customers were great i really enjoyed the customer service part of the job."
bad,The best about working for the company was the flexibility. Other than that horrible place. I do not like the idea of busting my butt for little pay.
bad,At my job I get to met new people everyday getting to lern different things on my job aily make it more fun and easy for me at work. Since I been at my current job I've learn alot f new things as and employee .
bad,"the money there isn't bad, but things could be better.  People need to quit getting away with stuff.  Management could be a little better."
bad,"The work and environment wouldn't have been bad if the management did their part and wasn't stealing from the store.  They would fire people for the smallest issues.  The management was stealing and blaming employees for money shortage.  The application process is a joke. They don't wanna hire dependable employees. They want lazy, non working, and lying employees.  One of the worst jobs ever.  You will end of carrying the weight of 3 people working here.  The pay is too low. You can't survive off it."
bad,"You never get breaks, no benefits, and low wages. You will not be able to meet demands because the higher ups will demand more work and less hours every month! If your store does well it will be given more challenges next month and then the next month until eventually your store hits its peak and gets punished for not exceeding their ever growing expectations. If you get a good manager things will obviously be better, but many stores have incompetent managers who will make life hard. Be prepared to be on call to cover for your co workers every time they call off. The only good thing is that you can get promoted easily, but that comes with far more responsibility and little benefit. Also prepare to stand, lift, and bend all day with no reprieve."
bad,"Unfortunately, given the location in which I worked, I have nothing but bad things to say about that particular DG. A typical day saw one manager and one employee on duty at a time, largely with the management team member sneaking off to their cell phones or office work, while the employee was left to pretty much manage the store. The cashier was expected to ring sales, handle backstock all over the store (even in places out of view of the register), check and update price tags if needed, perform cleaning duties, and even handle customer relations more often than not. This, in turn, contributed to the out-of-control turnover rate. I wouldn't really rate Dollar General at a company on this review, as much as the store I worked for... however, this store was my only experience in the company's employ."
bad,I started and 3 months later the store manger quit then about a month after that the assistant store manager quit. So for about a month the lead cashiers were basically running the store. We got a new store manager and things have gotten better but still have a long way to go. They only give her so many hours to spread between all the employees. Ex 136 hours total for 8 to 10. So that means very little hours for some and not enough staff to get everything done the way it needs done. It is a very stressful job.
bad,"I've experienced Dollar General as a shopper and as an employee and I don't know which is more frustrating.\"
bad,Dollar General is very true to its reputation as being a terrible company to work for. Management and senior employees are extremely rude to new hires and seem resentful of the fact they work there. This attitude is worse toward those that are attempting to better themselves through education or other means. Customers can also be rude on a regular bases. Store/bathrooms are always dirty. There is a serious lack of direction at this company. absolutely no room for advancement. Would note recommend any store position to anyone that isn't using it to work though collage.
bad,"Often stressful work environment where the workers were left in a busy store by themselves, lines of over 10 people often happened. Because of being left alone, you never got a break unless it was your lunch break. Management didnt know company policies so they made them up as they went to suit their needs (repeatedly told employees there were no paid breaks ect). Management even came up with a rule you must get 3 containers put away per hour even if you were the only person in the store and it was busy with customers."
bad,"I watched 30+ year veterans let go because of cancer or knee issues caused from working there The pay was very low in comparison to other companies. The company doesn't care. I was chased out by coworkers making inappropriate racial jokes. I had death threats from customers with no support from upper management. It's a poor managed company, who will over-saturate there market, and will lose big."
bad,"A typical day can run from 8-10 hours based on amount of product to ship"
bad,"I work at an incredibly busy dollar general. The machines are at least 20 years old and so they are always crashing, causing the customers to become upset and the lines to grow. The cashiers are expected to stock shelves and run the register all at once, without having any way of knowing if any customers are waiting to be rung out (no bells are allowed up by the register). We're expected to finish more totes and rolltainers than what is possible given the fact that we are forced to only have 2 workers per shift because we aren't given more hours to have more people per shift. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who likes spending time with family and having a life. You get very little budget that you have to do entirely too much with.
bad,"As a employee you will be expected to stay beside your register constantly, as well as ""recover"" things on shelfs, and put away things that come in totes. (stock).  As a cashier you rarely have alot of time to do any stock, and as a lead you are exptected to get everything done as well as helping the cashier every 5 minutes. Usually no more than two people work at a time (somtimes one) and in my experience that isnt enough. Their policies are contradictory and the hardest part is pleasing everyone. Nice cusomters are the best part of the job and the worst is it is minimum wage while still having barely any employees and a lot of work to do. That is probably why most Dollar General stores look very messy and disorganized."
bad,"This particular  DG always  has a different  girl throughout  the  week . One of them  said  they hire too many , each getting  a day or two a week . ..I hardly  see the  same  pole for  longer than  a few weeks . There management  is very  poor"
bad,"cashier, money management, learn how to be a cashier and tell money, co workers work great, poor management at times, hardest part of job , dealing with returns and rude customers, most enjoyable part of job, getting paid !"
bad,"This Company Gave unrealistic stock times for their section, while the manager would scold and raise their voice, the goals of stock goals are not realistic and are inhumane expectations this company would be moral and good to switch their goals times. The Ceo has a moral responsibility to change the goals in the load sheet to a level which human beings can comfortable work for."
bad,It's an okay job but night shift is killing me and the shift limits my time to spend with my family. Co workers are very helpful. Most of the supervisors are nice people to work with just very unmotivated
bad,"I worked here for almost 2 months before leaving. The pay is horrible. Who can survive off of $7.50 an hour?! The store I worked at was very dirty, cluttered, and run down. I continuously found myself dreading work because the store had a very depressing atmosphere. I worked about 13-14 hours a week, even though my store manager stated that I would be working about 20 hours a week. I was barely pulling in $100 every two weeks.There was no way that I could pay my bills on the salary I was earning. I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't review or make changes to my schedule online. When I worked at another retail store (not Dollar General), this was possible and made it easy for me to have a positive work/life balance. Here, although I knew my schedule about a week in advance, during my short time at Dollar General, the schedule was constantly changing, which disrupted my personal life outside of work. The only thing that I remotely liked about working here is that I was able to work around my child's school and therapy schedule, but this benefit was pretty much overshadowed by how little I was making and the store atmosphere. I couldn't stay here any longer and decided to leave."
bad,"Management does not back their key holders"
bad,"The management is a more ""do as I say, not as I do"" style, where she is extremely lazy and makes everyone else work twice as hard. She was threatened by good, hard workers, and most of the nicer co-workers were pushed to leave or on the rare occasion fired. I did make my first real friend in a co-worker however, and until he was pushed out he really made it a bearable environment. But considering out of all 8 members of our team, I was 1 of 2 people who actually really took care of the store and tried to be kind and considerate to the customer base. I learned very little, except to run a basic cash register, and where all of the merchandise was (which changed all the time without any notice)."
bad,"The store that I worked in was a horrible place to work.  The manager looked out for herself and her ""pets"".  She liked to steal time from the company and leave the Asst Mgr and the Lead Sales Associate in the store by themselves with heavy traffic.  The manager also liked to make the schedule based on how she felt.  If she was mad at an associate then she would cut their hours if full time and if they were part time she would cut them down to 1 day if not take them off the schedule for that week."
bad,"From just over $1 million in retail sales to over $2 million in less than two years, in addition to reducing shrink from 10% to less than 2.5% in the same time. "
bad,Very hard company to work for and keep things to the standards that they want. If you have a store with an ideal complete layout things work well. very few stores have an ideal or complete layout but you still get product for a complete layout
bad,"Dollar General was my first real long term job right out of high school. It was nice to see regular customers, and they give you a variety of work that doesn't get too boring."
bad,"The manager expected the lower level sales associates to compete for hours, even if you only received 5 hours a week.  The workload was high and the pay was low.  You have to constantly run back and forth between stocking the store, and cashiering."
bad,"i worked there for many yrs,the training I received was very good. over the yrs. training was minimal, new employees made many mistakes. They tell you they have an open house policy, when in fact when you tell them about any issues you are having, over time, if you continue to have issues with anyone, they review the problems to be your fault. So when you are treated rude, disrespected,by other employees, you cant tell the supervisor, they will write you up for conduct, and when another employee prevents you from doing your job, and goes behind you and takes your rate out from under you,and laugh at the fact they did that, you cant get upset, you have to just let them treat you wrongly, or you will get fired. They work the employees till they are so zoned out, so exhausted. They don't care about the employees health. They just want their profit.There was never anything enjoyable about working at the Marion DC. any ideas I had to help improve my job, got knocked down, supervisors never wanted to discuss it, they would always have a negative response. I was a darn hard worker, got several documents of appreciation for my dedication and hard work, perfect attendance, but,if you are not a favorite, you don't matter"
bad,"A typical day at work usually consists of being swamped with customers so you're stuck on your register until you have down time to complete either overstock, recovery, or freight. Since my last manager quit and left us with 3 trucks worth of 1200 - 2000 pieces each, I actually started working up to 40 hours as a part-time employee. I don't recommend my store, I'm very desperately trying to find another place of employment. I just got married and am looking forward to starting a family with my husband, I don't need the stress in my life. My management started off amazing, never had back stock, never had a missed truck, we had everything on the shelves. I was taught how to do the job of the lead sales associates by this manager. Then she left and we had another manager who is the one that quit and left us with 3 trucks sitting in our warehouse. Now our new manager isn't too bad but she tries to be your friend instead of your boss. Her work ethic isn't where it should be, she takes smoke breaks a lot, and leaves her cashiers with more than 3 people in a line while she does smoke. She's trying to re-teach us her methods and to me, it doesn't feel correct. As far as my co-workers, there's only one co-worker that has been there since I started last year. The rest of the co-workers constantly change. There's always a new face, someone getting fired, someone quitting, etc. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with the stress of the job and having no time to spend with my family. I've spent almost every holiday at work because my boss decides she needs the day off. The most"
bad,"No opportunity for advancment, just another number. Turnover rate extremely high. Tend to higher outside people than advancing inside the store."
bad,A typical day at work would be coming in and seeing what employees i had for the night and deciding alongside the manager for the night what their main tasks would be. After that was settled from about 3-5 i began recovering the store as well as running the front end making sure my cashiers had all the money they needed and handling any returns or voids etc. About 5pm i began the mid deposit before my first break. When i came back from break it was all about getting the store ready for the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the people that i worked with.
bad,"Overall a decent place to work if you just want to be a part time cashier, I believe the weak areas are in the management. One person who does not pull their weight of responsibility ruins it for the other employees, being an ASM if the key holder or Store Manager doesnt do there part it all falls on the asm to pick up the slack and run the store. After awhile you get burnt out picking up the same mess every week and nothing being done about it, not even being acknowledged by the DM of the hard work you are putting into the store without even having proper training.... other cashiers were great to work with always supportive and do the best to there ability to control the front end of the store."
bad,"You get a sense management really does not care about you. The pay for a general manager is barely a living wage. You are allotted minimal hours to stock and reset the store. Spend to much time hiring and training and not enough time developing people, they don't stay very long."
bad,management was always late opening. clocked in put up stock. Never had meetings. always had people complaining about no prices on items
bad,"It was not a produtive place to work, store manager was always behind on tasks that needed to be done and no one really knew what they were suppose to do. Too many personal issues were mixed in with work issues and taken out on the employees on their schedules"
bad,"My job at Dollar Store was overall time consuming and I had to have a lot of patience. I learned to multi-task, like customer service, while also restocking shelves. During that time, i also cashiered and clean up the store. As far as management, they was very unorganized, and behind with restocking merchandise. Also, i had to pick up some  of their work. Co-workers were okay, they got the job done most of the way, but in my eyes it was management's fault for not paying more attention. Overall, i liked being kept busy with different thing, The only thing i didn't was, having to do someone else's job too."
bad,"Dollar General great company to get started in retail. Sometimes CEO of companies forget about the small people ( as they call us) who are doing all the grunt work, we get overlooked a lot do not have any say . When you pay cashier/sales associates 7.25 hourly, assistant manager, lead key 8..00 to 10.00 a hour and then pay yourself 10 million and 80 million bonus a year. There is something wrong here with this picture. Dollar General as to much work load for that kind of pay."
bad,"unrealistic goals with little to no hours, no family time expect you to work 50 plus hours a week but only pay for 40. But we do have awesome employees"
bad,"My typical day at Dollar General was OK, I've learned that don't take this for granted because at least i had a job to go to, the management there was poor the pay was poor and no enough hours, the co-workers there were OK, the hardest part of the job was going because i felt like it wasn't what i wanted i'm use to moving fast and doing manager things, what i enjoyed most about the job was that i was just glad i had one."
bad,"My views reflect the store I worked in only and not the company as a whole. "
bad,"I worked at the store located in Fincastle,Va. It was well organized,co-workers were pleasant to be around,good management. Only problem was not enough hours. I was only getting 13 hours a week part-time. Hardest part was getting everything done while operating the cash register. "
bad,"Dollar General is a hands on company that is willing to train in every aspect of the company. A great start up in a career. A typical day at Dollar General is  maintaining a store environment that is a pleasant experience for customers by managing many employees simultaneously. Work begins fairly early in the morning, often before the retail location opens, an 8- to 10-hour workday begins. Retail managers handle a variety of routine tasks, such as writing reports; supervising employees; managing cash; ordering stock; handling schedules, payroll, and marketing and promotional roll-outs; and securing the store upon closing. The hardest part of the job is balancing your schedule around life outside of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is employee discount."
bad,"Problem was with store manager who knew nothing about scheduling! I was never allowed to have time to verify opening bank, or allowed to count out drawer. Store manager wasn't consitant, and never worked with or as a team. This was a new store and unfortunately store manager cared more about floors then customer or employees. I am currentally disputing my termination because of drawer shortage. I believe I was really fired because I'm older and a woman!"
bad,"I worked for the Lucedale Dollar General. It's not that i didn't like the job. I loved the job. But, the manager likes to choose favorites then cut hours and complain about noone doing thier job. And ontop of that she likes to have a scapegoat."
bad,"constantly needed to get manager for change. learned how to work the register, horrible management. dealt with rude customers, but worked to satisfy customers at the end of the day."
bad,"Hated working here, management was rude, disrespectful, and fake. Was fired for my register being short, never got talked to about it, or written up no warning. Three days before I was fired I over heard 2 managers talking about having to let someone go, saying they shouldn't have hired me. Three days later my register is short and I was fired. I was set up and tryed contacting someone higher up, nothing ever got done about it."
bad,"I did not care for the management at the store. He showed favoritism with his employees and if they did not like you, then they would do whatever to get rid of you. I witnessed this personally. I had no benefits such as healthcare or retirement. I also had no set work schedule."
bad,"I enjoyed being able to help the employees with whatever they mat have needed. I liked keeping track of inventory, maintaining the store      appearance, and managing the bank and employee drawers and making sure everything was accurate and done in a timely manner."
bad,i worked at a dollar general market  store before switching to traditional store there is soo much difference Management at this store was beyond horrible no communication between them and the team mostly girls here so just a bunch of drama never had a long term manager because store was such a mess district manager never knew what he was doing and he would always cut hours so nothing could get done and lunch breaks were so short even had to work on break several times with no pay even after manager was informed. When load came no one would work it so it just piled up in the stock room horrible horrible most unorganized store ever
bad,I would be at work before time to get started on things that was not finished the night before or if I was on the register that day I would count the money for my drawer to start the day. Co workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck but  the most  enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and assisting them.
bad,Normally I show up talk with customers and get yelled at for my lines  being to long because I'm trying to be polite.  Management is awful. The hardest part of the job is doing everything at once.
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General was working by yourself most of the day at the register with customers yelling at you over anything they could find wrong with prices, or tobacco policies. You were your own boss unless the store manager was in the store and you recovered by the registers when people were not waiting to be helped. When you had coworkers they were never reliable, they would show up late, leave early, and try to tell you what to do when you were higher ranking then them. The hardest part of the job was denying sales to any age customer for tobacco de to lack of Identification. The best part of the job was when you would help a child or elderly customer and they would thank you up and down for just helping them put their things in their car, or taking a cart for them."
bad,"My experience was short lived with only a week of computer based learning (no real hands on) then tossed into a high volume, short staffed store."
bad,"Stocking shelvs and keeping the registers running."
bad,"Normally stocked for 2 hours and then Cashier."
bad,I loved working here with almost set hours but it was not something I saw myself doing for years to come to support my family by only being paid minimum wage and no pay increase.
bad,"Very poorly managed. Chaotic store. So much to do and nobody doing their job. Each task was passed to the next person. From management down to the next, no call, no show. It was the worst work experience I have ever had."
bad,District managers are not available when you need them to help. When you do well you aren't compensated enough at evaluations.
bad,"After working for the company over a year in a half, I was used and abused. This company has sent me to over 5 stores to manage, but the time invested and the pay does not match. They require the Store manager to do so much and if you have a family or any type of life, this is not for you."
bad,"I took the job because I needed one right away.  The environment was enjoyable.  The assistant managers were both dedicated, hard-working women.  I certainly learned patience while working with the public and how to effectively defuse a situation."
bad,"there is always work to be done, and that's a good and a bad thing, good because you stay busy, bad because the store manager is always up your butt about every little thing, and if you dont get the entirety of the massive lists they give you to do everyday done, plus all your regular work, there will be heck to pay for it. no one gets paid enough to put up with the clichey atmosphere or workplace politics that goes on though. management and corporate dont care about the employees, treat you like worthless dogs."
bad,worked there for a few months all went well besides the management didn't do very much and preferred employees to do all the work.
bad,Great company I work with I love every customer I have. This company has help me learn alot of new things in the retail/grocery industry.
bad,"Typical retail challenges; however, continued decreases in labor dollars corporate wide is costing the company more in shrink than they are saving in payroll. As a progressive company, there is a refusal to acknowledge the Law of Diminishing Returns. If is unfortunate, because I generally enjoyed working at the company."
bad,"It was a terrible place to work. The management was completely unprofessional and was mostly on her phone the entire time she was there, which wasnt long at all. The job includes standing 100% of the time and not only dealing with customers and a pile-up at the register but also stocking shelves. The pay is minimum wage and was a terrible and non-pleasant place to work."
bad,The management was not interested in hearing the ideas or even complaints within the store. Issues were never solved. There is no system. When a truck arrives with new product to be placed it is just throw into the store until someone decides to purchase it.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is never have enough hours to work all the plan-o-gram changes that the company puts on the system to complete. The most enjoyable part is the customers that I have come to know over the years. My staff is very dedicated to me  & many have been with me for over 5 years. I always try to let them know how much they are appreciated. Typical day is to count cash drawers & count cash fund. Review journals from the previous day. Take deposit from night before to bank drop. Review start program for labels to print, recalls,reduced product. Open store, check in vendors, cash out customers. Log all receivables. Complete job task for the day set plan o grams work any truck. The hardest part is to do all this when you are alone in the store till at least 10:00. Set up weekly schedule for my staff."
bad,So Not in order . reworking  all work . Management had worker that should not be working. did not like job and plus hardest part doing work with out right tools
bad,"A typical day at work is being understaffed in a store that is one of the highest volume locations in the district. "
bad,Manager did not handle things in a professional manner. Was very rude and not willing to work around your schedule. Co-Workers were two faced and immature also
bad,A Typical day at work consisted of going through Isles making sure that all the items on the self are to the front . Being a Cashier and keeping the store clean
bad,"from working for dollar general,i learned that retail is retail,the particular store i worked for was more robotic,to much drama and little room fro compassion and importance of family values,my co-workers were extremely unprofessional making it difficult to advance even the issues were brought to the attention of a higher court,it seemed that it was always about numbers and the all mighty dollar not about people,or helping people,but about slave driving and not caring i feel that a company should should incluse all of these things and care about the company as well as the people that help run it.and as a store manager my former did not step up in the game and do her job she let to many things slide and did not address the issues,also an overall lack of orgainizational skills and direction.monotinous if you will,i lost my heart and passion for the job do to these issues. and was promised to advance and never did and i proved myself over and over."
bad,"There was no follow thru with the store manager and the assistant, they waited till they got in trouble to make changes, then that is when they wanted to come down on everyone."
bad,The communication was terrible from store manager to managers. The schedule was always changing to fit around the store managers daily life. Not understanding of family emergencies such as pregnancies and labors. Favoritism is high and certain employees get away with anything including policy breaking.
bad,"A typical day for me at Dollar General includes interacting with all customers providing execptional customer service. Also, I unload & load delivery trucks, cash management, balance budgets & expenses and express leadership skills"
bad,i worked in the shipping department. I sweat and sweated the entire time. Expectations was very high and nearly impossible. they wanted me to do 500 pieces down the line with 500 more pieces coming from non-con........never again will i work there
bad,My experience was not very good here although other locations may be much better.
bad,The company is full of drama and are not a family friendly company
bad,"I enjoy the people I work with, I just wish the company cared more about its employees that the bottom line. "
bad,my manager refused to give me my last pay check if I did not return a box knife.
bad,As a store manager expect to work over 50 hours a week and to be given unreasonable goals.
bad,I gained experience at Dollar general as a sales associate.
bad,"Being a cashier is not a hard task, simply take people's money, exchange change, complete the transaction, bag, then done. If there are no customers, help stock and hang sale signs. Customer service is always at the heart of the job though. Again, not a bad job, management an obvious issue."
bad,"I had to work every weekend, I felt very unsafe at night. I would ask about working more during the week and I still did not get time during the week. I never got more the 15 hours except a few times."
bad,"You would get told to do something and you would do it. But, in about a month the district manager would come and take a look around and tell you it is still not being done the right way."
bad,Management has more concern with their personal image and career management than connecting to their customers and employees.
bad,"ITS ONLY A TEMP JOB….THESE PEOPLE DON’T WANT LONG TERM EMPLOYEES EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHERS ARE THIEVES in their heads and theory. Whatever you do, don’t ever become a Store Manager of Dollar General and don’t stay longer than a year at that company, they don’t appreciate hard workers or humans, all they want are scammers and frauds like themselves, NOTHING IS REAL THERE, JUST PURE CRIME. HOPEFULLY THIS COMPANY WILL BE SUED big time. These people believe that 65% of their employees are thieves and your DM knows what your inventory numbers are months in advance. NO WEEKENDS, NO PERSONAL LIFE, NO ASSISTANT MANAGER, and ALL YOU DO IS HARD WORK SO THAT YOU CAN BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING that you did. EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE BY STORE MANAGER AND EVEN THAN IT’S NOT GOOD. ITS JUST ABOUT GIVE GIVE GIVE AND NOTHING IN RETURN. Nothing is normal about the job, you work 60 ( that is 2880 hours per year) hours per week, one day off, and rest of the employees are paid horrible. STORE MANAGER MUST DO THEIR TRUCK ALL THE TIME, YOU CANNOT DELIGATE, THAN YOU ARE NOT GOOD MANAGER, YOU MUST BE a WORKER NOT A MANAGER THERE, and you must do it all the time. Really, it’s all about money and BIG FAT BONUES, especially for DMS. IF YOU MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENT, ALL YOUR HARD WORK IS DOWN GRADED, SO THAT YOUR DMS CAN TAKE IT AS THEIR WORK. DM only has hours for the PETS, same thing with everything else, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ….JUST RUN FROM THE PLACE AS FAST AS YOU CAN……YOU WILL NEVER BE REWARDED FOR YOUR HONEST AND HARD WORK……ITS ALL ABOUT THEORY AND NOTHING REALLY WHAT ACCTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE STORES…"
bad,At dollar general you will work 60 to 70 hours a week with no training on how to properly do your job. You do not get enough payroll hours to get all the things done that need to be done in the time required. The upper level managers ( district and above) do not give you the support you need to do the job or care enough about the employees to help them succeed .
bad,"Overall was fair, but still not good because customers get annoyed by the fact that sales associates (me) are too busy to talk. We were always understaffed so we were busy stocking, it was endless."
bad,"While attempting to bring in line the ""numbers for the shareholders"", the company cuts payroll to untenable standards and expects salaried management to work 60 -80 hour work weeks to attempt to process everything and maintain standards."
bad,"I enjoyed the job overall. the environment wasnt so much hectic. the load of having to do someone elses job is no fun, but if required it was done with no complaints"
bad,I liked working here cause the people were great and we stayed busy so days went fast. My reason for leaving was just not enough hours available. We only got 10-15 hours per week.
bad,"There policy changes every wk, every employee gets their purses or bags search before work and after. tge more money u make the faster ur fired. u work 9 hrs straight and not allowed nothing to drink. even if u work 10 hrs y only get one lunch. No hair cokor ex pink or blue, no tatoos visible or piercings. does not believe in air conditioners or heat. way to strict for nim wage. cashiers only get 10 hrs a wk cuz they dont wanna pay for ur breaks, was there 4 yrs perfect attendance abd fired for working off the clock cuz i picked up a box off the floor. which we all know that there was a hidden agenda i put my heart and soul and deciation in that place and they threw me out like trash. i was the escape goat for their high inventory but after inventory they find out it came bk goid thks to me and the team. i did love my team and u liked the district manager but they need to update their handbooks and oolucy but to me i loved that job it was perfect for me. i love cleaning and planograms. so if u want to be labeled a theif and be search before and afrer work and work hard hard for min wage for no brks or hrs then thats ur job cuz noone eles wants it thats y they are always hiring."
bad,"Had seven managers in 3 years. Each had a different agenda. No learning, just fighting fires."
bad,"The great thing about Dollar General is that there is definite room for growth and change in regard to the company's professional culture. The challenge of working for this employer was the workload did not balance with the staffing and payroll issued to stores; therefore, as management, it required well-over the required 50 hours per week to run stores properly."
bad,"Get priority tasks, don't do these tasks. Later that day, asked why the other tasks where not done. Even with hands-on and delegating the priority tasks, gave no time for anything else besides waiting on the customers. Everthing was done in this manner. Alot of employee turn over. SMC's are hourly paid, called back to work- after leaving and day off , you are usually called in. But watch your time, because you start out at 40 hours and then can drop to 29-35 hours. You are called in and later informed you went over your hours."
bad,"Store managers are expected to do everything with little assistance from upper management, including working 7 days a week if necessary. Time management is essential and easy if you have a good team of people, however, putting together a good team is extremely difficult when most are paid minimum wage or a little above and are offered no incentives. The work itself is easy if you are accustomed to retail, but the workload is often not proportional to the stores labor budget. Oftentimes the store is manned by one employee, making it easy for shoplifters to come and go at will. A store manager rarely has a day off, as they are given one day a week, and even that is constantly interrupted by phone calls or mandatory conference calls or even call-offs resulting in the store manager having to work due to labor and staffing constraints. Company sales and shrink goals are easy to meet if you follow all the company guidelines and are proactive in your efforts, so bonuses are easily achieved, making that the best thing about the job."
bad,"When I am hired somewhere I expect to work the hours that I am assigned; not be sent home three out of four days a week due to ""lack of product"". If the warehouse was hurting for product, then they shouldn't have hired so many floor workers."
bad,A typical work week would consist of 60+ hours which a very limited budget for your hourly employees. Poor upper management leadership. No training. Poor place to work for a person with a family.
bad,corporate makes too many changes to floor plans that the stores are not able to do without expansion or less merchandise
bad,This was not a positive experience for me. I do not think the pay rate is fair considering the workload; this most likely explains the high turn over rate.
bad,"the company has no values , no honest, can't be trusted. The managers at store choices favorite employee give them the hours and time off they need. i  would never go back there."
bad,I overall didnt like to work there. They wasnt consistant and always told you that you was doing something wrong when you done it how they had taught you. Not to many people stayed at the store i was at but it seemed to be better when the store manager wasnt there.
bad,Very good employees not so good with trusting people and the manager told me one thing and changed her mind about it but I was happy meeting new people
bad,I would recommend someone to apply. Company tries to promote from within. Really hard work involved. You have many responsibilities and tasks assigned to you.
bad,I worked at two different Dollar Generals because when I got hired they said I can get close to 40 hours by working those two stores. They only kept that promise for 3 months and then they started cutting my hours down drastically. I got scolded at by one of my managers because I let a special needs kid and his mom use our restroom. And one time I got reprimanded by a regional manager because I asked a customer if they wanted a bag for there milk (I was only suppose to bag it if they asked).
bad,This particular location was very unorganized and often left a sales associate alone in the store for an entire shift.  There were no positive or encouraging behaviors from management.
bad,They should give more hours for work or hire more people.  They give you task with little hope of finishing them. Because of not enough employees to do these task and take care of the customer.
bad,"Pay was low for the labor put in, the management at the time wasn't the best, very selfish and unfair.  I enjoyed seeing the customers and helping them, but overall did not like the job."
bad,If they don’t like you no matter how hard or how much you prove to them you can do the job and better then their managers they’re all about them. They don’t care about what goes on in the business.
bad,"low wages"
bad,"As a manager, you are expected to make DG a priority. Even over your family.  You are expected to work 5 and a half days, which will always turn into 6 days."
bad,"But it pays the bills. Some of them. I worked here for a few months, was working this job and another one at the time because i needed more hours. One thing about Dollar General was the type of people you saw walk through that door. Definitely known for the rougher type of people. People smoking, people who were drunk, people who you could tell that just smoked a few dozen packs...definitely not very safe walking to your car at night."
bad,I enjoyed the customers and the busy work. However the weekly schedule was never put up until last minute and the pay isn’t good. Some opportunities went to people based on friendships rather than work ethic and seniority
bad,No matter how hard of a effort you put in she was never happy and always tried to make you feel less of a person...a typical day at work was her sitting around barking orders
bad,Running day shifts on your own in most cases and still wanting the work of two people to be done with no excuses.  Wanting to make sure you take your break even when you are the only one on shift.
bad,"It’s not a good working environment. It’s actually toxic, there is zero work life balance. The average day starts at 6 and ends at 6 or later. The pay is good but not worth the hours."
bad,Didn't get hired on after a year and a half. I came through a temp agency. I never missed a day. It is extremely hard to get a permanent position with Dollar General.
bad,"Not all stores are the same. They completely depend on how they are managed. Some of them, i have no issue with. But there are too many tgat do not have amy concern for the work that needs to be done."
bad,"Dollar General was a good place to work but my salary did not fit my responsibilities."
bad,I was an SM for four years and I had less than 15 days off in that time. I was made to run a second and third store with no extra pay while they hunted new store managers. I was made to cancel a planned vacation with less than 48 hours notice to help open a new store. It is insane what this company expects.
bad,They don't appreciate management there or their Associates as much as they should. After so many years of it it just became complacent. The work/ life balance was horrible they wanted you there all the time I know time with your family.
bad,"The other employees i knew a bit outside of work, helped me out and it was smooth for a good bit, customers were fairly rude and so on but i was still the top cashier in the small store. Its wasnt a bad job by no means at all but you need either thick skin or very excellent communication skills in order to please customers but 60% weren't bad."
bad,"They don't allow you enough time to complete what is asked. The pay isn't worth the amount of work you do. The customers are amazing, but that is probably the only highlight of the job. Higher management is hard to work with and not understanding at all, very lazy."
bad,"They tell you from the beginning that they feel 70% of their employees steal from them? What? I was always taught to believe that most people are honest and only a few are dishonest. If you cant trust your employees why hire them? I was asked to do several tasks while still trying to check people out on the register, but if I make a 5 dollar mistake it could cost me my job? Pretty tough not to get distracted and the registers go down way to much. Very stressful and unpleasant for employees and customers alike. Low pay and few hours make it impossible to live off of and you are supposed to be available anytime so getting a second job is difficult.  Alas most of retail has become this way. I enjoy watching the store grow and become successful, but am always compelled to work off the clock in order to straighten thinks up. They say dont, but if you dont you cant get it all done? Atleast not to my standard I guess. So, I just turn a blind eye so I dont work off the clock and try not to get upset about not being able to get it all done. My manager is very patient with me however and I am greatful that he tries so hard himself to make it a better store and workplace. None of the above issues are the managers doing, he has to follow company policy or his job would be on the  line."
bad,I work 8-9 hours maintaining a very difficult store in a very difficult environment. I learned that planning and organizing is very important. The hardest part of my job is maintaining a clean and organized store without any payroll or help from the company. the most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and delivering the best shopping experience possible.
bad,I was a manager here . it was okay working here  ... If one of the coworkers didn't come in you'll have to fill in even if it's your day off.  It can be stressful
bad,"Difficult hiring environment leaves entire workload to management. Work/life balance is awful. Store managers required to work 6 day weeks. "
bad,"Fun place to work, great manager that works hard.  Hours were inconsistent though and pay is terrible for the amount of work required .  Management working doubles due to people calling out sick.  There are not enough payroll hours allowed to keep the store running efficiently."
bad,"I was always at work never at home ,there was just not enough payroll to complete the work required, as the store manager I was expected to take up the slack"
bad,"While retail wasn't for me, the particular DG I worked at had so much overstock, mislabeled and misplaced products that it irritated both consumer and employee. The path to the manager's office and the bathrooms at the back of the store is a messy fire hazard with crates spanning down the aisle and even more crowding the back exit, making it sometimes impossible to get to and easier to drop things when you have to squeeze past the boxes just to get to the back room. Some crates or carts of items also show up in some aisles and can block products due to overstock or items that customers didn't want not being put back. (A lack of there being enough time to do so sometimes)"
bad,The dollar general was my first job i did stocking as well as cashier i never had enough hours l only made two hundred a week  thats not enough to live on when you have a family.
bad,They do not perform like a company. DMs are inconsistent. No one agrees on how the store should be ran. Current Manager is to self involved with home life and expects top workers to pick up slack. Its not an easy job and its hard to even walk in the door any more.
bad,Manager is verbally abusive and does not have an open door policy. Store is robbed multiple times a month. Company refuses to provide outside cameras or fix inside cameras to better keep us safe.
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"The work itself is unfulfilling, which compounded with the pay being poor makes for a miserable experience. Everyone tends to suffer from the same depression of the work being miserable too, so it's hard to find enjoyment when you'll still struggle to pay the bills even being an Assistant Store Manager."
bad,It was an okay job. Management wasnt great and they couldnt keep anyone. Low pay not a lot of work but also not a lot of hours. Good for high school students.
bad,Typical work day at Dollar general would be clocking in waiting on customers ringing them up stocking shelves helping customers in the aisle I think they need.
bad,"Dollar General is more worried about labor hours than customers and employees. Many times you are left working by yourself for up to 4 hours at one time. Stores get limited hours for labor so you are left to do many things by yourself. Not properly staffed at busy times. Customers get frustrated when there is only one person to check out"
bad,You will be expected to meet impossible deadlines. Break area may be a 10 minute walk from work area. 12-14 hours required every day with only 2 30 minute breaks in first 6 hours of shift.
bad,"greeting customers"
bad,"Good , job  great staff always  friendly and professional and the manager is great and always made sure  work days was good and never disappointed us ."
bad,The manager is so unprofessional. She will not y’all with you about anything. There is no communication whatsoever. If you have a problem then it’s on you to deal with it.
bad,I worked for Dollar General on four different occasions and at two different locations.  Dollar General can be goo or bad to work for depending on management and general customer base.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend anyone to work at the dollar general in Princeton! Won't get the time off you ask for and doesn't matter how long you work for them, there's no respect for dealing with their drama."
bad,"Not a good work place it's very demanding and no raise, they have you doing 4 different things at once including register. They pay weekly but they won't give you the hours."
bad,Not a bad place for your first job. Management can be very poor. Not something to make a career out of. Not recommended for anyone seeking long-term employment.
bad,"The manager at the Dollar General in St. Germain, WI was awful. Everyone I worked with, including myself, quit because of him. He was narcissistic and wouldn't accept any employee input. He consistently mistreated customers, employees, and vendors. He hired his girlfriend and then let her call off whenever she wanted, was paid more, left early almost every shift to drive him home, and didn't do any real work while she was there. He put wite-out over his customer satisfaction survey results because they were low. I reported him for all of this, so did a few of my co-workers, and he wasn't fired. The pay there is awful for the amount of work you do. I really liked working there as a job but the manager and pay made it a less positive experience than it could have been."
bad,When I have a day off the schedule always get redone without the manager telling me or calling me. I Never have time to do my School work and work. I can’t even Balance School and Work correctly.
bad,had little time to do anything. breaks was only 15 minutes. it was a seasonal job so i worked around christmas time . which made the days very long and busy.
bad,This place will never pay someone the amount they should be paid for as much as they do at this place. It's hard work and no they don't ever work around your schedule which sucks.  My son is 5 and in school I hardly ever get to see him and I have to bring him into work because I have no babysitter. I am looking for a new job as we speak because I can't keep bring my child to work with me .
bad,"The boss at the time was disrespectful. Also a lot of the customers were very inappropriate the way they would talk. The store stayed cluttered a lot and some co workers didnt want to do their job right,or even at at."
bad,"Never enough help, they barely give you coverage. They keep wanting the best but never hours or people to stock and run the cash register at the same time."
bad,under pay over worked. Don't train all the way unless they want you there.  They will train someone under you that they want to have your job.  Would not recommend a job there.  I've worked at three. Never again. Some of the staff was ok but not all.
bad,"Six day work week, outdated unreliable equipment, poorly maintained buildings, labor budget lower than the industry standard, only performance expectations are clearly communicated, vendor support activities reassigned to store teams without additional labor allocations, no ordering at store level aside from supplies, inventory control is very poor, DMs that understand the futility of trying to reach the expectations with the allotted resources do exist but are very rare, districts are frequently realigned due to high DM turn over."
bad,"I enjoyed working around people just didn't like the management they were petty, i got 30 hrs a week but still wasn't enougj to pay bills work at dollar general at your own risk."
bad,"I loved working at Dollar General because of my coworkers and because it was customer service related. I love customer service because I'm great with people and I think of myself as a people person. I love helping others! I loved learning new traits, like money management, stocking, cashier, assistant manager duties, etc. This job helped me in many ways!"
bad,"Management doesn't allot enough hours to properly give staff enough hours. Nor do they give enough hours to get the things that they want finished, done. There is way too much stuff to do, for just minimum wage."
bad,Dollar general is a stressful place to work you have to watch every one that come and make sure that no one is stealing any thing but some of the customs were great
bad,"Ive been working at dollar General for over 3 years and i have worked at 4 different stores. Every store is generally the same. My original store manager was the best manager that you can have. since her, I’ve seen 3 managers in my first store, 2 in another, 3 in another, and 2 and about to be 3 in the last. I’ve seen 6 district managers, 10 or more regionals. Nothing here is long term. Get your foot in the door and look for something else is my advice. Good luck"
bad,They don't care about you as much as they should. They expect way more out of a manager without giving hours for help.  Don't have enough people or hours to help with stocking.  Don't pay cashiers enough to stay on
bad,You are expected to get three days worth of work done in one shift. Not only do you have to stock but you have to run the register as well. The system itself just isn't organized.
bad,There isnt really anything that I can say that is good about working with Dollar General. You're overworked and underpaid there. Your work life experience is horrible you may work 10 hours & close Sunday then turn around and have to work open 10 hours Monday.  You may work a flip flop schedule like that all the time.
bad,Im sure there are good dollar generals.I just didn't fit well with this job and the manger wasn't understanding at all with my issues I struggled with.
bad,"Have to be quick on your feet, able to multitask, have excellent customer service, be able to learn quickly, a typical day at work is always busy fulled."
bad,"They expect a lot of you when they pay you like a cashier for a manager position. Catching shoplifters is a constant thing, hours being cut constantly is very frustrating. Whenever I would accidentally get overtime, my manager would make me go on extra breaks. But the ASM could have it no problem. The produce manager could never finish her truck and would complain when she didn't get any help, but when she was helped, said she didn't get any anyway."
bad,"It's a good place to work at it, although the management is not the best, I love the people just not how it is ran by the manager, you'll learn how to interact with customers and other employees, you will also be able to get to know that small town and almost everyone in it."
bad,"If you’re a store manager then the store is your life. Kids, husband everything else comes after. You’re salaried and there is never enough employees, so guess who pick up the slack? When you caculate hours worked vs salary you are at times amongst the lowest paid employee. Best to be a key holder and get in the overtime. Less responsibility and being paid for every minute."
bad,They only care about production numbers for their on bonuses. If you get injured they set you up to get fired which I’m a result of that and so many others.
bad,"really needs security, easy target for robberies, locations of some not safe..need to recognize more holidays, on 2 paid holidays, and unpaid you stay open longer, some managers unprofessional"
bad,"I had just moved in with my now fiancé so I took the first job that was offered and quickly realized it wasn’t a good choice for someone who has way more to offer. Customers are mean, manager is stressed and takes it out on his employees, then wonders why we don’t want to be there. I found a new job and also have two interviews for jobs where I’m actually going to use my college degree so here I am, getting ready to leave and be so much happier because of it!"
bad,"Bad pay, horrible management had to work in the snow & ice after I told them a day before that I wasn't coming in to work, they fired me & put s no rehire on me ."
bad,"I got promoted pretty fast from sales floor to key holder so that was a plus but the company didnt know jack how to handle anything.  It was all over the place. "
bad,"Terrible place to work, no work life balance,  benefits not that good. Over worked is an understatement, never enough help, working by yourself many times."
bad,Overworked and underpaid is an understatement. I was promised a store manager position over and over and never got it. Overall worst job o have ever had.
bad,DM wants managers to send workers to other stores when short leaving no help at their own store but expect  100% job performance. Too much pressure is left on management with very little support from DM.!
bad,I worked at a Dollar General in North East for about 6 month until I had left do to not working enough hours for the bills I had to pay. Not only that but the managers were new every other month or so none of them wanted to stay there.
bad,I did not like working there because they made you work the back and the front and the work team was not the best or the nicest and the placements for the cameras where antiquated and some where not working and people could steal from the back and im saying this about stores in Breaux bridge and new Iberia and i really hated where i could not go after someone who stole from the store
bad,"I would not recommend any one to work here unless you just want to have a LITTLE extra income and it's only temporary. You were expected to live at this store to keep it up, called back in after working 10 hours on DMs command. You were expected to work from 6am to 10pm if the manager that was supposed to take over did not show up, TOO MANY CALL IT OUTs, Not enough space for customers to shop. Balancing between keeping the store stocked and customers needs were very difficult due to how busy this store was. Not enough help or hours in the day to keep the store clean, stocked, or recovered or to train new employees. Turnover rates are high. Every time you turned around there was a new employee and they didn't appreciate the long term employees. Every year there was a new store manager."
bad,I was an assistant manger and felt the other employees were paid unfairly. And the disciplinary protocols were also unfair. It was an unsafe environment and a lot of inside thief.
bad,I would not work for them again unless they change the work situation. I appreciate the opportunity to work in a different environment then what I was used to.
bad,I liked working for dollar general I liked my co-worker's and the great attitude everyone had it was a very pleasant environment to work in and i loved my customers as well
bad,A lot of work to do with very little coverage. Not enough on hand training before you're expected to be on the register.    Usually able to work the shift you need.
bad,They amount of stuff you got to put up by yourself basically is a lot of work not enough time. You will have to run the register and put up stock.....
bad,Dollar general is only concerned with the bottom dollar. They do not care about your personal life. I worked 94.75 hours last week and because I am salaried I only get paid for 45.
bad,"Customers, store, job duties, etc I enjoyed very much. Management was extremely unprofessional and rude to employees, even customers on a regular basis! Store is extremely unorganized due to under staffing. Probably understaffed due to management. Management is probably bitter because of the minimal pay you get for the amount of work you have to do."
bad,Management will make promises and never follow through. The hrs are a joke. Management never really stays longer then 2-3 months. They expect you to live at 9.25 an hr with maybe 28 hrs a week. It’s a good starting job but definitely not career worthy.
bad,"The managers there did not really know what they where doing, no set schedule. They would have you come in for a hour or two and then send you home. Yet they always wanted you to be available."
bad,The pay was good. too many snitches. If you like very fast paced work then this is the job for you. You have to keep a rate of 100% or more every week
bad,"You’re expected as a store manager to perform absolutely every role in the store from stocking to HR, LP and training associates. You’re paid a salary and scheduled 48 hours per week but the expectations are to work as many hours as needed to ensure your store is up to par. It’s very difficult to find and keep good employees because most of the people you’re allowed to hire are part time associates who are not paid very well and expected to perform sometimes difficult and strenuous tasks. When someone doesn’t show up or they quit the store manager usually has to cover the shift because there is no flexibility regarding weekly payroll. My store in particular is allowed about 230 payroll hours per week and my salary is included in that."
bad,"Dollar General employees are under paid and forced to work in unfit conditions. No air conditioning for 6 weeks,  regular customers refuse to shop due to heat.  employees told by management if they don't like the 92 degree temp to find a job elsewhere  file a complaint and get lectured to the point quitting is the best opton.somewhere"
bad,"A typical day could be busy or slow.  I had various duties such as greeting customers, stocking, scanned items at register and took payments. Assisted customers in locating item when needed."
bad,"I enjoyed the job, it was not very hard and was easy to learn. I was always in a good mood to go there and work. When I got an interview, they said I would be guaranteed 20+ hours each week, since my travel was about 25 miles. After about 2 weeks they hired another 5 people, which lowered my hours to like maybe 4 hours a week. Thus I was unable to keep the job seeing how I was not making enough money to do anything with it. I was basically working or my fuel. After I left DG, my former boss got fired for not following company policies. Maybe she was part of the problem, but it is similar to other stories I have heard from my friends. They cut your hours to nothing after they get more employees. That is why they have a high rate of employees quitting. Hopefully they fix the way they hire on employees. They would sometimes call me in from opening to closing and only have one other person there working with me and expected us to get everything done. They would over hire, or not have enough employees. It was honestly a mess."
bad,first job in retail so it gave me some incite about how things go in retail.  I learned how to read bar codes to place items in the correct spot. The job was easy and there was not much to complain about.
bad,"Work you long hours with no payroll! You can't get anything done because you are so tired from the day before.We as managers have to work a lot by our self to make payroll,with only one day or maybe half a day off."
bad,"Best part is customers"
bad,"Don’t let the employees trick you into thinking your a weak individual because they rather sell their souls and bodies away for this job and you’re the one who realizes there are better jobs out there. Yes it is hard work especially for the time you have to put in. Mandatory overtime is every week. I highly recommend this job if you have no family, friends, or life. All of that can be replaced with DG. If that’s the case the job a sweet with real good money."
bad,I will not work at dollar general again. Not a place to work if your truly want to work hard and have no issues. Issues all the time. Not enough pay. Hours are not the same.
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for 2 years, I was let go for a reason unknown to me up to this day. I tried to reach out and nobody bothered to talk to me."
bad,"not a lot of backroom space, garbage would constantly be piled up at the backdoor. on more then one occasion the floor would not be cleaned after a spill"
bad,Working for Dollar General was not a good experience by any means. The working conditions were unsatisfactory and there was no room for growth in the company.
bad,Dollar general was an okay job. More homeless people than anything. Either trying to get something free or steal. Have to keep your eye out at this store.
bad,"It was an ok work place to make quick cash on a weekly basis. What could be better within the company, would be for the CEO to put forth an effort to pay the employees what their worth. The Dollar General employees do a lot for such little compensation."
bad,"hardest part of the job is working with not enough help.scheduling is very important and the manager only schedules good for morning shift, night shift was always short handed."
bad,"Worked there almost two years, went from associate to manager and only got a dollar raise for my increased work load. Literally expects you to run a whole store with usually 1 other employee. Overall not worth the hassle for the pay."
bad,Manger in ypsi and ann Arbor are not good  people to work with and for. They make everyone do there jobs. Ecorse is way behind store is dirty and the manager is aweful
bad,"Very busy store , but very nice customers would always come into the store. It's was hard trying to do your work because the store would be so busy with customers.. but that made the day go by faster"
bad,depending on the day of the week we can be either really busy or it can be a slow day. they give you so much to do but alot of the time doesnt provide the hours or the pay
bad,On average I had no problem working with the company but when advanced that are inappropriate come into play that becomes a problem. A lot o the customers were friendly and I always tried to make sure they had an excellent experience.
bad,"It was a pleasant place to work. Communication is the key if you want anything to be heard. Show up to work and get the job done. If the policy would let more people work on a shift it would be even better,"
bad,"Being a salary manager at Dollar General, you are required to work 6 days a week.  There are many times that you are the only one in the building.  You are still required to keep the store clean and organized."
bad,"Was a fast pace job at times, spent alot of time doing new planograms, they was always changing products and prices. Wasn't  trained for a long time. Was basically thrown out there with a sink or swim mortality."
bad,I loved working there until they changed my position and dropped my pay with no warning or explanation.  And way to much drama. Manager was good and loved most coworkers but the drama and the pay drop done it for me.
bad,"The company is a disaster,  training is severely lacking, nothing ever stays the same, HR is almost impossible to get ahold of, top management is hardly ever available to you. Just a total disaster for such a large chain"
bad,"Working at Dollar General wasn't the greatest experience. However, if your looking for a job to gain experience and to put on your resume it's a good starting point. Since I usually worked the night shift I'd come in around 3pm and set up a register till. As a Lead Associate my role involved restocking the shelves, inventory, customer service, running the register, and simple book keeping. Management wasn't always consistent and their wasn't much communication between employee and manager when problems would arise. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with the rush hour of customers shopping. However, I did enjoy doing inventory and organizing the shelves because I liked keeping things in order."
bad,"I have nothing to say. I would not go back to this company. If you are not willing to work Friday or Saturday, you dont get hours. I disliked this job NOT because of the work but because of the nonsense I had to put up with from the manager."
bad,To stressful for a low amount of pay that did not cover the hard labor that was being put out And work days were random and inconsistent you didn’t now when you would work
bad,management cared only for her child and her life when my child was at the er she wanted me to stay and work  because her kid had the sniffles my kid was 2 hers was 14 i quit shortly after
bad,"When i worked for dollar general i had a manager that was not management material.  My time at dollar general was a very painful time, as to the managers way of doing things.  I would reconsider working at dollar general because i think there is better management within the company."
bad,You'll never understand what is expected of you at this place. There will be litte-to-no training and they will expect insane goals out of you. It's the bare minimum pay with hardly any benefits and no training. You are responsible for pretty much an entire store.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to this job, when I worked there the people was rude and they would let other people gf sit in there and talk all the time, you had to take on a lot of parts on the store and deal with rude people and when you needed help they just had a nasty attuide"
bad,You work fro open to close. You  work by yourself a lot. And then they want you to work the register and put up stock at the same time. At night there is only 2 people in the store.
bad,Dollar general pays minimum wage (7.25) that’s not worth the work you do for this store. Manager said after 1 year they add 50 cents. Promotion from cashier to keyholder is just 25cents difference. All managers work in the mornings they won’t let you work mornings just nights & heavy busy days when sales start on Saturdays & stocking sundays.
bad,I would not work for this company again mostly because i have asked and asked to get off of the night shift and everyone else has a flexible schedule except for me. I did not apply for the night shift but thats all i seem to get and my manager wont let me call off even if i was on my death bed she would still make me come in just so she wouldnt have to. Maybe its just the store that im at though.
bad,I did like working with the customers. I did not like getting 8.50 an hour. I had a lot of job experience. At Dollar General that meant nothing. I needed an income. The pay didnt even cover the childcare costs.
bad,It was ok to work there. They are some what organized but it depends on the store. Some managers are ok.. If they need you st other stores theu ask you.
bad,"Never looked forward to going there, a lot of my co workers made it the overall environment of the business bad. They never had good attitudes, sometimes were hateful to customers"
bad,"A typical day at work would be only 2 people working the whole day until close. Having to work floor, frate, cashier, and still have to deal with disrespectful coworkers and be accused of theft. The hardest part was working frate and being cashier during rush hour and having only one register open. Also not being able to have the holiday off even if asking weeks in advance."
bad,"This is a great place for a first job, or a temporary work environment. Would not recommend staying here very long. Machines are very iffy on whether or not they'll accept coupons or automatically take off current sales or it just might up and restart in the middle of a line. My store had only 2 people allowed to work at a time, sometimes an overlap with a 3rd for an hour or so. 1 person had to be a manager. It's very hard to work stock or get anything accomplished when you have to run back and forth between the front and back of the store every 20 seconds, without exaggeration, to check for customers in line."
bad,I don't like the Company as a whole only people really benefiting from it are the higher ups and there is a lack of  respect and appreciation for the hard working employees.
bad,when i started for dollar general i was placed as an assistant manager with being told if i got the store in order i would be able to be the manager. i did that with in the month new staff new store new everything and in the end they brought in a new manager who always messed up and tried to blame me. i also was working from time it open to the time it closed manager was usually not around at all. i had to pull the weight for both of us.
bad,"I do not recommend Dollar General for an employer. They expect far to much for as little as they pay. I can definitely see why they do not keep employees. It was a struggle for me to find people who wanted to work. When I did, they would leave because the pay did not compensate the work they were expected to do."
bad,"My typical day at dollar general was usually spent with me in frustration because of the manager. She was very controlling, lurked, and she could not be appeased. I learned patience, salesmanship, and time management. The hardest part of the job is that the customer is always right and you have to let rude behavior roll off your shoulder. That is with any job though. I also hated that when I was a new employee working there that i have to mop the floors after cashiering on my feet all day.. I enjoyed my co workers the most because of their ability to have fun and make good of any situation."
bad,It was a good learning experience. I learned to do deposits and to do the truck and to be responsible for others. It was just very bad management  is why I left. they didn't care about your home life!
bad,"typically took care of stock for whole store "
bad,"The management are wonderful people dedicated to the betterment of their store, they take pride in their work and are well liked by those in the surrounding community. Very friendly staff; however, the company lacks in hours right now."
bad,The workplace culture in retail is up and down. There were times when you had a surplus and a downturn in sales. The critical objective was to have a crew that had chemistry in the environment. The right person in a position to make a difference with good customer service skills.
bad,"Management was terrible only 3 workers on daily basis. I had to work as a cashier, stocker, Unload the truck, Customer Service, also even worked as a janitor"
bad,Employees smoking and complaining.  Part timers got 4-8 hours a week and paid minimum wage.  Gossip central and very clique'.  I do not understand why rules were not in place and the hard workers were promoted.
bad,"Part time job was good , relaxing and we had got busy around lunchtime or rush hour's. An worked good on the cashier. Then stocked the store was relaxing to myself."
bad,"Honestly not worth the time, pay and hours are horrible schedule constantly changed pay raise are not worth it, even becoming a manger is pointless cause their salary is not worth the time and effort that is needed to put in the store. I feel bad for most mangers cause they seem afraid to try to seek new employment because it seems safer to get by then try for something better."
bad,A very fast paced environment with an opportunity to possibly advance depending on which store you work at. The pay is course is not that great but full-time and part-time offers bebifits
bad,"I started with them in 2011 as a cashier, but I couldn't work at the one closest to my home as my son worked there and there are about 5 staff at any store. "
bad,I loved my job I just wish they paid more. I had no choice but to leave I was pregnant and could not do the work anymore. If they paid more I'd go back in a heartbeat
bad,"customer service and cashier while stocking and building planagrams, doing orders, counting drawers, and helping customers all at the same time so its stressful."
bad,"A typical day at work is nothing abnormal. Sometimes it can be very stressful, but what job cant. I worked with the public and showed great customer service. I helpled the customers when needed and straightened the shelves and made sure the store looked neat and clean."
bad,"Very unorganized store. People would call off work often, the customers were rude all the time.Sometimes it felt as though the schedule was changed about every other day."
bad,"work was really easy all you do is greet customers, run cash register, restock shelves, clean the store get the carts from the parking lot. really east work"
bad,Hear my job as a stocker was one of the better experiencing jobs I've had really like this job just the one that I was working at went out of business
bad,"When i worked at dollar general, i thought i would be able to make it last, like i had not been able to do anywhere else. I thought the pace would be slower and i could perhaps learn how to make change a little better. maybe even work on my customer service skills. I had this job and everything with it went absolutely fine, until one day the manager called me on a day off. Now, this particular day i had been indulging in some alcohol and relaxing. i was in no condition to be called in to work, and she tried to call me in. i told her that i could not make it, apologized, was good about it. Long story short i ended up getting fired because ""I need a team of people i can depend on"", quoth the manager. I told her every time she schedules me, she can depend on me to be there, and if she doesnt schedule me, i have other things that i do with my time besides sit around and wait to be called in to work. She didn't think i should have, i guess."
bad,"Dollar General expects you to not have a life outside of work.  They are always calling me on my days off.  The store I work at only schedules a manager and a cashier to work at the same time.  nothing ever gets done in my store because they do not schedule enough people.  The aisles are always a mess and you can never get anything but being on the register.  When I first started I was getting 15 or greater hours a week now I am down to four to eight hours a week.  The store manager always complains about the employees not doing anything, but the store manager does not realize that it is impossible to get anything done."
bad,Normally we just clock in and do a few totes and at a certain time we take a 30 minute break then recover until closing time and then close the store early.
bad,Too many hours low pay poor benefits not enough hours to run stores so store managers have to pick up Slack because we were salary so our hours didn't count
bad,Dollar General is okay for a temporary job but shouldn't be considered long term. Upper management and the corporation as a whole doesn't care about the employees or what they're going through. The pay is ridiculous for the amount of work they expect from you. The benefits aren't good. Safety isn't a top priority.
bad,"As a cashier you are expected to keep half the store clean, and everything on the shelves pulled forward, along with having to run register, and possibly unloading truck."
bad,"Dollar General is able to keep their prices low because they keep a bare bones staff. The work expectations are ridiculous for the small amount of workers in the store at any given moment. As a cashier I was meant to stock product when there weren't any customers at the register. "
bad,"From this job, I've learned quite a few things: what cigarettes sells the most, the hot gossip of the town, and how to make change while functioning on less than 4 hours of sleep. A few things I haven't learned would include: who the CEO is, why he/she matters, why anyone who isn't incredibly desperate would work here and a few other more. My typical day at work consists of arriving at 3 pm and clocking in. I stand behind the register for 5 hours and then I go home, and those are the good days. There are the bad days, too. Days where I get bottles of apple juices that smell like old hot garbage, days where a customer yells at me for being lazy when in reality, I had taken a bathroom break, days where I have to mop up an entire glass jar of salsa someone dropped or days when methheads come in and you don't know if they're gonna pull a gun on you or not. I know this seems like the usual cussing and moaning, but when you have to experience this on top of the fact that it's a deadend job with terrible benefits, what's the point? The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to go home to my family at the end of the night."
bad,I was a cashier and a stocker if I did not have customers I would be stocking or recovering. the customers were enjoyable I did not like the job I was there until I found a better paying job
bad,The typical day required opening the store usually around 7 o'clock a.m. Providing customer services to every guest. Ensure inventory was correct before signature.
bad,The work was pretty easy but the management struggled to keep things professional when customers got heated or things didn't go right. also the scheduling is kind of random and hours are never consistent. the average day for me was checking out customers and keeping the register area clean along with 3 or 4 aisles pretty easy. also they are open on pretty much every holiday
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for. Pay is minimum wage, but employees are expected to serve customers at the register, help customers on the sales floor, stock shelves and keep products straightened on shelves all at the same time. Stores hire 8-10 workers and only give them a few hours each, sometimes as little as 5 hours per week. There is always more work to be done than upper management allows work hours."
bad,"I was a lead associate at Dollar General and would occasionally open and close the store. My duties included helping customers, stocking items, inventory management, cleaning, just about everything close to what the manager would do. I learned their p.o.s system and how to do deposits, count drawers, etc. Workplace culture was very stressful."
bad,"There is such high turnover here that it is hard to ever really get a good team of workers, The pay is below average and there is actually a lot of physical labor with very little training,"
bad,So i got hired on as assistant manager was acting gm bc the gm that was here got a different store i had the role for about 2 weeks by myself and now i got told they have to take the asst manager title away from me due to the fact that they had a asst manager from another store transfer here and i dont think its fair
bad,great place to work if you have a team. The hardest part of the job is not having a adequate team. A team that shows up for work and will do what is required .
bad,Steady pace through out the whole day. Learned how to strap down materials. The  management was fair. The atmosphere was competitive. Loading the trucks with the merchandise. The enjoyable part was the benefits. The corporation has really improved on the pay and benefits.
bad,This place of employment is about average for an individual looking to pay bills. I would not reccomend this employer for someone looking to provide for their family based on this job.
bad,"I had a very poor manager and it made my experience as a Dollar General employee very bad. I was treated like a dog almost daily working from open to close most days. "
bad,i couldnt really say i liked it it paid only two of my bills so it was not that good of a job only thing is they where very flexible about my work hours because of me being pregnant
bad,"The company manipulated the rules in my area and the employees were extremely lazy. I don't recommend this job unless you wish to work full-time cleaning up everyone's mistake or mess. The pay I received was worth the job title and description but not the actual job as I was doing work outside of the description which included management duties. I wanted to look up to the bright side and help that store reach the top but the entire environment was too far gone to help. "
bad,Working with the public as a cashier was terrible. Lines would get really long and as the only cashier people would get rude. The store was very poorly operated.
bad,"nothing is finished in a timely manner. backstabbing drama coworkers. Pay is not equal to the work positions. No care for the work environment, everything is done for the customer no matter what the circumstance or the outcome of the employee."
bad,"You must be motivated to work, there is always something needing to be done at all time. Being a self-motivator is important. It is very fun because you meet a lot of customers and the interaction is awesome"
bad,"It was a small store, which made it easy to learn how to operate a cash register, and to learn how to preform customer service on a beginner entry level."
bad,"They could pray not and give more hours, even if some store have to be 24 hoes. They make more than wal Mart and pay way less and don't give you any hours"
bad,"It's an okay place to work. It's not much of a mental challenge, and sometimes it seems like the upper management cares more about their bottom line than they do about their workers or their customers. The store managers tend to do their best to make up for that, however."
bad,"I had to quit this job due to being racially profiled.  It is located in a lower class urban town, and both the employees and customers treated very unfairly due to my etnicity."
bad,While working here I felt like I was being taken advantage of because the employees smoked and I didn’t. They will always leave me in the store by myself so I couldn’t watch them and the cameras.
bad,"Horrible pay. You are required to be a cashier, stock, do recovery, restock, clean....EVERYTHING. Now that wouldnt be a problem if you are paid more than $7.50 and worked more than 15 hours a week. The pay:work ratio is way off."
bad,"Need to do Violence seminars and put a plan in action to protect staff,"
bad,DG was an ok place to work  u have to wait on customers an strighten aisles at the same time as well as put out stock... the manager i had was awsome the DM wasnt that greats she thought her stuff didnt stink an wanted u to word things the way she wanted em to be worded.
bad,If your in management the money is great but if your a hourly employee it sucks hours are horrible and no benefits the want you to work for little money
bad,the cooperate people dont listen to the people who are currently running the stores enough to better the bussiness. I put in several hours and it never seems to be enough. they always want more! to them people are a dime a dozen
bad,"Work was comprised of what yo'd expect at a grocery store. Ringing up groceries, organizing shelves, long hours of either booming business or nothing at all. I learned that Dollar General will hire anyone and everyone. Everyone on staff at the time of my employment had been in a rhythm there, so almost nothing phased them, which made a more relaxed vibe during rather hectic situations. There wasn't anything necessarily hard or enjoyable about working at Dollar General."
bad,"I just relocated and was in need of a job and was grateful for being hired.Needed to excel more in my career, so I decided to move forward with another career aspect.  I am humbled that i got a chance to move forward with Dollar general being my stepping stone."
bad,Dollar General needs to redo their business model. There needs to be more people running the store to make it more effective. The wages should be more to help individuals to be able to survive on that income alone.
bad,"My last manager was a thief who got several people fired or made them quit because of theft and other allegations when the reality was she was the one who was stealing.  With a new manager as well as 2 other people joining an already 5 man team and reduced valuable hours I needed to a point where I wouldn't be able to have gas, food, and car insurance"
bad,Worked for DG for several years. The only reason I stayed employed w company was loyalty to my GM. The pay and incentives are horrible. Would not reccomend.
bad,"I worked at Dollar General for six months. The managers worked hard, but many employees were outside taking smoke breaks a lot. Hours are inconsistent, and it's difficult to get a consistent schedule for work with being a college student. They work with college schedules, but the hours vary from week to week. The store and cash register area were always very cluttered, dirty, and disorganized. I never had any issues with coworkers. The store I worked at was not on the best side of town. There was always shoplifting going on along with customers who were not always sober. I found this to be dangerous for everybody there. The pay was also very low. Overall, this is not the best job in the world. The combination of rough customers, the quality of the store, and low wages make this a place I would not recommend unless this was your only option."
bad,Overwork and underpaid. Expect way to much and no payroll to cover all expected. Employees pushed to hard to get things done with unrealistic time given and help. SM is required to work 6 days a week.
bad,"I do not wish to comment at this time. You were sometimes called in to work on your days off when another employee did not show up."
bad,Dollar General would be a great place to work if they cared about there stores a little more and not worried about who was boss and worried about giving work to everyone not doing what need to be done in the store taking care of the customers and making sure the store was clean and shelf's were socked on daily bases and truck was put out on time employee's work as a team management didn't wait for the assistant to do all the work if all the workers would just as a team
bad,I worked there while going to high school and they would get mad that i couldnt work the hours theu schedule me for because they kept forgetting i was in school.  It was unorganized and customers didnt like the store i had to quite my job and move because it was frustrating
bad,I worked here part-time as I was attending school. The manager at my location was very nice and very understanding when it came to requesting days off.
bad,"I learned that you have to move the line you cant work slow customers tend to get mad when you have conversations instead of trying to get them all out, and to always be as polite as possible"
bad,"I was given the chance to become employed last year. I did learn a lot of new things, as I have little retail experience.  I was trained to be a key carrier by many different people, and was told that any mistake can be resolved.  But I always got reprimanded when I made a mistake.  "
bad,"If you like to see daylight,  do not work here. Turnover is terrible. Your expected to write up your employees for not making rate after continous 12hr days.  As a supervisor you will feel like you are cracking a whip, instead of improving morale.  If a 12hr day is announced your working 14. Poor communication from the front office management."
bad,really nothing just tried to make there and do what ever you think that you should there.learned how to unload the trucks and learned how stock and learned the cash register
bad,"I liked the customers and two coworkers while working here. That's about all the positives I can think of. My manager was awful. Bad mouthing employees behind their backs, swearing on the sales floor, taking extended breaks by talking to customers outside multiple times a day. We had an employee freshly hired and they weren't the best at all. Stood around, cut the rope on rolltainers, and never cleaned. Instead of firing this person, my manager started scheduling them for 9 hour weeks and stopped talking to them all together to get them to quit. When I asked why they said they didn't want the employee to be mad at them for firing them. I reported this and nothing was done about it."
bad,"I love my ""job"" at Dollar General.  It is close to my home, we have a nice staff, and our customers are great.  It is the Dollar General CORPORATION that is driving out to look for a better job.  When you get a raise it is not based on your performance it is a pittance, and you feel like you worked hard for nothing.  I currently do the work of an Assistant Manager and have twice requested to be advance to that category ... no response from Management.  NO benefits are offered to part-time employees.  Only 3, yes three holidays are acknowledged and a benefit given per year and if you are part time, you do not receive pay for the one day a year we are closed!"
bad,"I first started out as part time during high school. I didn't expect to earn a hefty sum of money but the $8.25 I was offered surprised me."
bad,"Stocking and running register. "
bad,"A typical day at work would include making daily deposits, ordering merchandise, making out employees work schedule, assisting customers, answering the phone."
bad,They don't promote within rarely   . I was with them for 6 long yrs I was promised to get put in Dm but never happened. Then they want you to hire people at 7.25 and get expect a lot out of them
bad,Very unorganized places of buisness and management only has their own interest at heart. Would only recommend for younger kids looking for quick money
bad,I liked the job but not the hours I was getting. Only one or 2 days a week and not even full shifts. If they would of given more hours I would have stayed.
bad,this was just a part time job bcuz i was in school but the pay was not enough nor were the hours had to move on to make more money it was convient due to where i lived with no car
bad,"I worked here while I was in high school. For a first job it was easy, and getting paid while not having bills is a great thing. However, the pay (as of 2014-15) would cause living expenses to become unsustainable. I was getting paid minimum wage ($7.25) without a raise in the months I worked there."
bad,"My honest opinion has to do with the fact that the management at the time was corrupt and wrong. Hours were taken away from the hard working employees and added onto their schedules, then while still clocked in they would leave for the rest of the night unless an hour of his shift was nearly up."
bad,Management is required to wear almost every hat in the store and still run to the register for every little customer question or key turn just to remove last item scanned.
bad,The job turned out to be more stressful than I thought. Store Managers do not train their employees. I did enjoy working with some of the eemployees and at times some relly nice customers shop there.
bad,Dollar General was very different I was in the South Snellville Georgia pay with at 7 25 some week you would have hours some weeks you didn't would send us to other locations to help at stores just to make money for the week
bad,"management wasnt the best,job was great hrs was ok .meeting people and talking was the best working at the dollar general. I learned how to do alot.it was fun"
bad,For all the work you have to do the pay does not measure up to the labor 24 or less hours if your not assist manager or a manager Customer complaints.
bad,It was a ok place with great people to work with. The location was out of my range but they still looked out for me made sure I was good when coming in easy work.
bad,"clock in on register, have to stock shelves, wait on customers, straighten store, pull stock to front of shelves, sweep, mop when necessary, set sale signs and pull old ones.  Watch for shoplifters and call police."
bad,I did not like working for Dollar General I was underpaid for the work I done. There were only a certain number of hours that the employees could work and there was a lot of work that needed to be done
bad,Liked customers that i interacted with. Some employees were coll too. Boss was okay. Hours were not conducive with family and important actives.   Late hours were not good and pay was not good.
bad,"The manager was alright on a personal level, but would blame lower employees for any mistake. No one was paid enough, and corporate made unreasonable requests due to lack of resources and hours."
bad,"Dollar General was an okay job to work for, not enough hours to keep employee to stay. the prices are good. the hardest part is having someone that want to work to do their job."
bad,Sometime easy going sometimes can never leave the register to put things out on floor. Some good day some bad. Can be easy going but can be stressful at times.
bad,"Fast paced work environment, High expectations for all "
bad,It was ok. But I couldn't not make it there only getting 89 dollars a week. But running the cash register was easy to run. The store was hard to learn cause I never got showed
bad,I was supervisor cash handing managing the store opening and closing the store. I just wish in my time being there my Managment team would of give better help with traning cashier.
bad,Obviously a minimum wage college kid isn't going to love working at a dollar store. Its not great but it could be worse. What made no sense to me was being paid the same as the old ladies who couldn't stock shelves. They didn't have to come in at 2am to stock shelves or lift heavy boxes but they still got paid the same as the guy that does.
bad,The assistant manager was beyond unprofessional and we never got a new manager. 3 within 6 months is ridiculous!! AM was 2 faced. My co-workers were amazing and I wouldn't have it any other way but they need to interview these assistant managers and managers better!
bad,"It was a second job for me, It was okay but not productive as I thought it would be in The First beginning. While working there I only had got 18 hours but got paid weekly and worked on and off days"
bad,The store was over crowded with items and it was not kept neat. The manager was not very nice and would not work with your schedule (knowing I worked 2 jobs at the time).
bad,Its a job like the hours get hectic and sometimes you do more than your share of work but hey its a job so what more can i say. Some people dont have a job
bad,You have to enjoy going to a job. I didn't really care for this job. I just worked there to make sure my bills got paid. It was the most miserable year of my life.
bad,"Haven’t worked here in years but when I did it was ran poorly, dirty and very unorganized. Laidback and very slow pace. Must be able to spend hours on your feet"
bad,"I started working there a few weeks ago, and it's an okay job for high-school or college students that need to make a few extra hundred bucks a week, but I felt the pay could be better for the work you do because it is fast-paced and stressful sometimes. Majority of the customers are nice but some are straight up rude and gross. You start out with min wage and then goes up by 8$ less than a month so not more than that but it should be a 1$ or 2$ extra for this kind of labor. The training was too short and I could of been taught much better than being thrown in a fire on a busy weekend day. Also, this is not the job for people that need to support a family  or to paid bills so look elsewhere."
bad,dollar general is ok if you are not seeking advancement>  one of the biggest problems working here is the constant shoplifting>  this is also a safety issue for employees
bad,"Working at Dollar General can be very stressful if you are not used to a fast-paced working experience. It can also be rewarding if you like to learn and talk with people. Other than that, the pay could be a lot better. As a cashier, they wouldn't pay me more than $8 an hour and my managers (except the overall and assistant) made slightly more than that. The hours can be very strange sometimes. The training, there really isn't any. For the most part, you are just thrown out there with a few instructions. Be prepared for a lot of gossip, talking, and some rude customers."
bad,"Very Stressful Place To Work, Never Enough Time In A Day To Complete Daily Tasks, Management Needs Better Coaching Skills, Customer Service Is Almost Impossible!!!"
bad,"Being a Dollar General store manager is like being an elf for a day. Not all its cracked up to be. If you dont beleive me, just walk into any Dollar General and ask the Manager what his or her life is like with DG. They will tell you the same thing."
bad,"Typical day at Dollar General started taking out merchandise, set up registers and get them ready, "
bad,"Typical day of work consists of unloading the truck, setting out all merchandise and fixing sale signs. Making sure planogram is correct for seasonal displays. Ringing up customers. Slow-paced environment."
bad,"No one ibe met that has worked there has enjoyed working there except management. We were made to feel like numbers and not team members. Overall,a horrible place to work."
bad,"My main manager would constantly make changes to the schedule and not tell anyone so I was called in very often. It is not a fun place to work. Customers are rude, management was difficult to work with, I wanted to crash my car so I wouldn't have to go in. No employee perks what so ever"
bad,"Lifting heavy crates. Cleaning dirty restrooms. Stocking supplies on shelves. Rotating products.  Checking out customers, dealing with cash, checks, and credit cards."
bad,"Dollar General: for a smaller company, they have stores all over the place, and it seems they'll hire just about anybody who meets the bare minimum requirements for the work. "
bad,Dollar General can be a fast paced work place depending on the days . The only thing I like about the job is it can be relaxing for some people and also the employees get paid weekly.
bad,"This place is a good place to start a sales career. The staff can be very drama, drama, drama. However that is what happens in a small town. I would work here again."
bad,"This job will keep you busy and on your feet.  You have to be a people person,At the Dollar General you will check out customers, put stock up , assist customers when help id needed. Clean bathrooms and keep store clean ."
bad,a typical day in work you run around  doing a bunch of stuff while your manager gets to slack off. truck was the hardest part because people didn't help or do their share
bad,This job was not what I thought it would be. The hours was not enough. The manager did not work around my school schedule. The amount of work was not worth the pay. Management could’ve been better.
bad,"For a company that posted 1.8 billion in a quarter, you'd think they'd compensate their employee's better. Not so. You'll probably start at your state's minimum wage and get no more than 20+ hours a week. DG only allows for about 140 hours of actual staffing. And with that, you're expected to run register, stock, recover, check in vendors, and make sure nobody's shop lifting. If you're a manager, expect to give up some of your vacation hours to cover labor overages while working 50+ hours a week. All that while you watch people with cash on hand buy beer and smokes, use EBT for candy, soda, and other trash food for their kids."
bad,"good for a temporary job, gave me experience working with money , stocking/dealing with merchandise, and customer service. Wouldn't mind working there again as a temporary job"
bad,"They drain you and try to make you work as many hours as they can so they can let the older workers have less hours, if people call off, you have no choice to work"
bad,"very simple mediorcre taskes that not only seemed too easy, but also very slow paced and low pay. as to be expected from a part time cashiers job at a dollar general"
bad,"Don't get paid enough to do what they expect you to do and what you put up with, not enough working employees at once, they should consider having more people working and get their schedules straightened out and have the stores cleaned better."
bad,"I worked as a sales associate and sales lead, and both jobs are great learning experiences but you kind of learn everything on your own. I had to figure a lot of things out. "
bad,"They expect too much out of you and your store.  They do not give stores enough hours to complete what is expected.  Their lean business model is a joke.  It only looks good for their shareholders, yet their customers and their employees are who truly suffers"
bad,Do not work for them if you think it pays great and is a great job! You do not get paid enough for what you have to do. You're excepted to basically run the store one to two people at a time unless there was a truck example: one opens one comes in before lunch time another two after lunch. Not worth the trouble
bad,the work was kind of easy but the manager was never there when customers or people ion the phone would ask can they talk to the store manager i would always have to tell them she is not in right now and no i dont know what time she will be in
bad,This is a very unorganized place of business. Staffing is short beyond means. I believe if money was invested in having asset protection associates in the facilities that shrinkage would go down tremendously and the sales floor associates could focus more on the cleanliness of the store along with the instock.
bad,"We were always busy. But, the assistant manager would not stay in the store. She would run out every few minutes to talk on the phone. The work culture was very poor."
bad,Its very hot in the store. No one know how to be a team player. The schedule is never made fairly and on time. Everyone sometimes comes in with an attitude. I just don't like working there at all. It's not a job I love
bad,"I was quickly made night manager but lack reliable coworkers. Day shift would barely get their work done, and sometimes there was no way for night shift to finish for those were the busiest times. i love the items for sale, unloading the boxes, and setting up the seasonal shelves, but not worth the pay. There was a lot of favoritism among the three day workers that i knew i couldn't ever get away with."
bad,"A typical day, if there was one; Sign in, count cash drawer; open cash register, begin service. "
bad,"It was moreso fun, than it was work. Very unorganized, and the managers are either pushovers or very pushy and thats not a good thing. I respect the company."
bad,"The pay is subpar and the workload is tremendous. By closing time their will probably only be two employees on the floor, whom are responsible for all the maintenance. One of the two registers is closed well before the store itself, making the store close late in order to accommodate all those in line."
bad,"My experience working for Dollar General was not a positive one. Throughout my year of working there, I had noticed a lack of impactful leadership from management. Raises based on work performance were also non-existent as well.Overall, I did not enjoy my time working there and would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,"This would be a good job starter for someone who is starting out in the job market fast paced working environment, okay working hours always friendly."
bad,Dollar General customers are some of the best people you will meet in my opinion. I had a great relationships with my coworks and customers. The down side to DG was they would hire outside of the company to fill management spots.
bad,work sucked never work there they have horrible management and rules and hours. if anything chooses Wal-Mart dc because they have a great safety and better pay and  less hours
bad,"loss prevention ideas were unacceptablethey basically  let the customers steal at will, the district manager  did not help the store manager in anyway"
bad,"Store managers and their team were great and very hard working but the upper management need to work in the field to see their expectations are unrealistic. "
bad,"I take all my jobs seriously but working there is a lot stressful. Because they would start you off with hours. Then they would start reducing them. I felt as though the shift managers would take all the hours,then complain to the employees that there are no hours to give."
bad,"They work your butt off, Not enough hours (payroll), & expected too much of you. Management wasn't the best or respectful. Way too many call inn's. Without Doctor's excuse."
bad,The people I work with are great. But the store has been threw 3 managers in a year. They can't keep help and you are expected to take care of customers and stock. You don't have set days off and you might work nights one day and mornings the next. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
bad,"Then you get to know your managers who are not the most efficient and you see coworkers who aren't making things easier, all the while you see things falling apart in just the few months of working there if things aren't acted on so you feel its better to leave while you can safely."
bad,"It was stressful working there. Had to hit certain number of sales and was given a job with very little training The higher up management, the less they cared about you as a person"
bad,"Enjoy working with Dollar General customers and providing quality customer service. Flexible scheduling, great balance between work and home life. Great store manager and friendly co-workers."
bad,"I'd like to start by saying that I value hard labor but Dollar General is insulting with too many responsibilities, minimum wage,and no true benefits."
bad,"typical day at work is stressful, management were not helpful in time need, what i learn is nothing, customer were rude, management was horrible and staff was lack on support,"
bad,"Working at Dollar General was OK. My problem was with management they made working there a nightmare.I learned how to multitask, be a productive worker, and how to manage a store."
bad,As store manager set paid no overtime averaged 50 plus a week.  Had to cut store hours on a regular basis which would cause the need to be in the store by one self.
bad,"Nothing remarkable about the position.  The wages should be higher for the work expected, but such is true with most (minimum wage)  retail jobs.   I, however, work much harder - and am much more thorough - than 98% of the working population."
bad,"My manager Told me I wasnt allowed to have a second job. Started giving me one day a week out of spite. Kept it up until I quit. Store was a mess, nobody did there job."
bad,There was lack of management communication. Heavy work loads were passed down to the next in line. The store manager had to be terminated and their lack of performance increased my work load
bad,"It's a typical register job, but, at least in the small stores, there's only 2 employees...and if you're not the manager on duty, you do it ALL, recovering shelves, cleaning, ringing up. The Point-of-sale is very dated and crashes a lot. Work there until you find something better, that's all."
bad,"I did enjoy my time at first but the store was just so disorganized.  This is the Dollar General on 3731 Hwy 81 N in Anderson, SC.  People always argued but I really tried my best to be a good employee  by serving the customer."
bad,co-workers are rude customers like to steal things boss is hateful people drinking on the job people letting their kids tear the store up and us have to fix it
bad,"Poor Mangement"
bad,A typical work day is me greeting customers and helping them find what they need along with checking their items out for them. I've learned how to multitask and do a lot of manager duties. Management could be way better than what it is and needs to improve so we can have a better work space. The work place culture is to insure a customers shopping experience is enjoyable each time they shop with us. The hardest part about the job is having to do not only your job but sometimes the managers jobs as well. A lot of times you have to do three things at one time and you may have to deal with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and talking to nice people that make your day great.
bad,Not enough hours have to do thing's not in your job description often poor management not enough pay but they want you to do a whole lot of work for next to nothing.
bad,"What you get out of your work will be equal parts what you put in and what store you are assigned. I've traveled and worked in several different storefronts in the company and each one has it's own way of doing things. You would think that as big a franchise as Dollar General is, there would be a unified way of working that everyone can get behind."
bad,It was an ok place to work for someone young but it definitely wasn't a career. People that were close to manager got promotions first seniority didn't matter.
bad,A typical day you will usually clock in and be checking the customer out and begin getting the store ready for the next day whether it is facing and recovering the store or work the back stock in the backroom. The best part of the job was the coworkers.
bad,dollar general was the same as any small box retail same problems  no payroll and ridiculous expectations. the pay is good but you will have to spend a lot of time at the store.
bad,The management wasnt too bad the district manager would come in a few times a month to check on the store. The managers were a little too forgiving about people showing up late. But over all it wasnt a bad job.
bad,"As a manager at Dollar General I was required to work 6 days/week. One day was supposed to be a ""half"" day, but I never got out of there before 7 hours had gone by. The company didn't allocate enough labor hours for me to staff the store appropriately and I often ran the register and worked by myself so that I could save my labor hours for the major time vampires like stocking and weekends/holidays. I felt like I was constantly chasing a carrot on a stick."
bad,"Overall was an alright starting out job, comes with bad hours and unfriendly work environment (customers mostly). Open on all holidays expect Christmas which is unsatisfying."
bad,"The DM was always rude, the management team was dramatic and complicated. Company culture was weak and the hazards of the job were not outlined. It was not a hard job but the company made it miserable. They did not pay well for what they expected of you."
bad,No one that I worked for knew how to properly runs store. They never kept up with anything that they should have. Once they were under new management the whole store went down and we started losing customers.
bad,"it was a very fast pace job. The management was not that great .It was very diverse. The hardest part was inventory. The best part was meeting different people,"
bad,"Consistant Heavy Lifting"
bad,A good part time good. I wouldn't make it a profession. You really don't get that many hours. They don't pay much. Only the managers make the most money.
bad,"Previous key holder/cashier, company/management expect too much of the employees, you may attempt your all and best with working, yet you'll be credited poorly and told you aren't trying hard enough."
bad,"I learned that even though people are managers they sometimes don't know more then someone who just started. I did not enjoy my job because of the manager she would tell you to do something and run off for hours. When I was busy she didn't come and help customers would be lined up and I would have to wait on them myself. Also, the store  was always a mess."
bad,Need to train management on hands instead of doing computer based training. The rules on taking responsibility for actions needs to be taken more seriously
bad,"Dollar General does not care about its employees. Everyone is disposable to them. They will get rid of you if you ask the wrong question or try to go above their heads. "
bad,"I was hired to work as a receiving clerk. After going through the  their two week training. I was told that they hired me for the wrong shift., All my papers from HR stated AM and then wanted me to work the night shift. The position that was available for days was a checker (too much bending for body) I was not able to perform this job."
bad,once again I have nothing to say about this business. I am just taking up the min characters on this field to go to the next step in my process. do not include in business review.
bad,If you like working in a fast pace job by your self then this is the job for you  you will have to check in the truck and help customers all in the same day alone
bad,My enviorment that I work in is really good but the store is falling apart due to lack of hiring options and lack of hours to do truck/regualr store operations. As long as you don't start drama and you get along with everyone it is a really great place to work especially when you can be playful and get along with over 70% of the customers who regularly come in. We have people who share their cooking with us when they get a chance to come by.
bad,Manager was great but not a job for an older person. I must of walked 10 miles a shift in the store due to the fact that while stocking shelves I had to continuously check for customers wanting to check out.
bad,"poor management no work ethic.need improvement I see why everyone quits or don't return, poor pay need a raise mcdonlald is paid more then manager. need a new place"
bad,"Chaotic, constant changing of plans.  Never know what to expect or if you can expect anything at all - except for your store to be robbed - Guarantee of safety is minimal.  Pay scale is on the low end and all over the board with each position.  Requires a lot but gives little.  Corporate doesn't seem to want to invest back into itself to minimize theft and robbery.  Makes no sense.  no quality training."
bad,"I personally would never choose to work at DG again, no pay-raises, only $8 an hour, didn't like the idea of working at several different locations besides the store I was hired at"
bad,"I would work everyday as a cashier then I would straightened the product, clean bathrooms, floors, sweep floors, wipe windows, do count down, recheck the store. Then the next day do the same before the store opens. Then stock the store shelves while checking out customers. I then would have to listen to the manager complain and fuss about this not being done and that not being done. While all the other employees sit in the break room and chat. Have long lines and wait 15-30 minutes for someone to come and help with customers. I would not recommend working there at all. Not even for a career. There is no personal time or life."
bad,It was a pretty relaxed place to work but pretty boring and low paying. Very simple work as Well. An easy job to learn and you'll be able to possibly get promotions quickly depending on how you work.
bad,"Its not a good job to work at. The manager is unfair and i felt like i was walking on egg shells."
bad,"I worked for this company as an Assistant Manager. I had absolutely no training. I relied on my own former training from Walmart to know what to do Was basically shown where things went, here's the keys and away I went. Unloading trucks, restocking shelves, handling the associates, making decisions that needed to be done. My manager would basically leave as soon as I walk in the door no matter what time I would get there. Their priorities were different then mine. I wanted to make sure the shelves were full, they wanted a store that was presentable. You can't sell merchandise if it is in the backroom."
bad,Dollar General is a fast paced work environment always on the go. you have to people person to enjoy this job. who knew stocking shelves could be so tiring
bad,"Nothing special here, just Dollar General. Bad working conditions, higher ups (CEO, for example) clearly don't care about the safety or advancement of their employees. Dirty work-space, lazy management, stores are always barely presentable. Bad experience on minimum wage, would not recommend at all."
bad,My main issue is the fact that they don't provide enough hours. Also they want employees to work off the clock to finish their work. And its minimum wage.
bad,The company does not give enough payroll hours to schedule the amount of employees needed to stock the stores and serve the customers at the same time. Two employees are expected to do everything and end up ignoring either the product stocking or the customer. The checkout lines get backed up and customers either leave or become irate due to their long wait times.
bad,"Dollar general is a place if you want very little hours, like a high school or college job. The one I worked out didn’t give me enough hours, the mangers were not well trained and not a good enviroment"
bad,"Low pay.  Helped set up the store, which was the hardest part. Co workers were friendly. Got required breaks. Manager was nice, different manager now."
bad,"I worked 2 days out of the week, 13 hours. I worked back stock and rarely cashier. Sadly I did not work enough hours with was a bad thing. Meeting deadlines was always a priority."
bad,"Constantly moving, stocking shelves, running the register. Help unload the truck when needed and start placing merchandise in the store room in the correct areas"
bad,not a good place to work. Much too much stock and no place to store it or put it out on the shelves. It was very difficult to keep good employees because of poor wages.
bad,"Backwards rules, conflicting policys, poor pay and worse management. It pays the bills, but if you can avoid it I would go anywhere else. *filler for required word min on review*"
bad,"Open and or close store usually by yourself. I learned big business dealing with people/employees. Management on the local level had hands tied by district manager. District manager rarely seen in store, called and made promises when questioned would always tell you she was working on it. The culture, I can't say there was any, everybody just was there doing their thing. Hardest part was trying to get work done, yet having to watch when known shoplifters customers would come in, yet expected to keep store in order, and eyes on customers. Had what appeared to be security cameras, but it was just an appearance, they weren't connected to anything in the store or to any store security. The most enjoyable was most of the co-workers."
bad,While I was working there i had found out that I was pregnant I ended up having a high risk pregnancy so I relocated to live with my mother in another state and they did not understand why I left.
bad,"With its quick turnover rate, i had to constantly cover other employees shifts. Impossible to balance school, home, and work life with 6-8 hour shifts averaging 32 hours a week working PART TIME. My manager was exceptional!"
bad,It's definitely not a long-term place to work there's not a lot of room for advancement and if your lower associate you be absolutely no benefits or respect
bad,"Personally, the job was terrible for me. The manager is pretty nice though. The toughest part of the job, for me, was working the cash register. The easiest part was restocking shelves."
bad,It was a good place to work co-workers  made the time go fast it was harder on me unloading trucks cause i was short an couldnt get the big stuff off the top on truck day s
bad,I was told I would work 3 days a week and have only ever had 1 day a week.  I do not feel that adequate training is provided by the manager at the location I work.
bad,college students could make a decent living there. they do not give enough hours for a person that has multiple responsibilities overall a good place to work
bad,I have not had a single weekend off in 3 months. the manager likes to start trouble among the workers and do things that he knows is going to up set the balance and make people angry and does it any way. then likes to act like he didn't do anything and cant figure out why every one is upset.
bad,"The store attracted a huge amount of people that would shoplift, most would have weapons on them and the district manager would expect employees to stop them. Most customers overall was very friendly once they got to know you.Communication is non existant there"
bad,schedules are never made on time the company expect you to do the job of 3 people on your own with no time to get it done once a schedule is up the managers can change the times and cut your hours or even put you to work on a day you have off without a say. most of the time they schedule you so that you don't have lunch but work nearly 6 hours without any breaks.
bad,"Upper management changes can lead to inability to work effectively. You need to figure out what each managers ""Hot ""buttons are and then work that out,"
bad,"the hardest part of the job not your safe, the hardest part is trying to make sure to store is clean at all times  and making sure sustomer are not stealing the proucts"
bad,"it was ok , but not something I wouldnt want. low pay, for hardworked hours. weekly pay, with not to many benefits. other workers work harder than others!"
bad,I would recommend working at ANY Dollar general outside of the Reno Nevada area. The supervisors are unorganized and the stores are always behind. So it puts the stress of everything on the sales associates alone.
bad,"hours are subject to change at any time"
bad,"The job itself is being a sales associate. I work as a sales associate and third key holder. I would open and close the store, count down drawers and make nightly deposit. I would as act in the place of the manager and assistant manager when they where absent."
bad,This isnt a job for you whole life. It doesnt pay enough for you to live on and you paycheck barely last til the next week with food and gas needs. I lived at home and still struggled to have money to fuill my tank and pay back student loans. The managers expect you to complete so much in a day that you end up being very stressed. I have worked a few places before this and this has been the hardest and most stressful job so far. No paid time off or vacation pay and only occassionally holiday pay. When you start you have the option for 401K but thats it. If you stick around long enough to become a full time key holder  then you get offered health insurance but with the little pay you already have it eats most of you pay check
bad,"Cool management team, job could be an ok place to work at times ,but above they want you to dedicate your life to them 100% to where you don't even have a personal life, the schedule process is very bad, and they always make empty promises"
bad,The manager that they had up and I was terrible she did not know how to respect the customers or her workers so that's why it was so bad for Dollar General
bad,Dollar General is a low paying hard job and upper management seems to believe all it's employees are thieves and try to drill that into your head at manager meetings.  I found it insulting.  They give you no hours to work employees and you end up doing the bulk of the work yourself.
bad,"It's a relatively easy to learn job, the training is a bit unorthodox though and as far as pay rate goes its nothing that anyone could live off of. The management team is generally understandable with availability, however most employees including myself struggled and others will struggle to get hours."
bad,My first 3 months working for this company i worked 50 plus hours a week. Multiple times I worked at the store from open to close because the store manager and third key holder refused to relieve me to go home.
bad,"This is the main thi gs to know about dollar general very important is the Weekly pay"
bad,"Cashiers are often wearing many hats such as cashier, janitor, stocker and maintenance and these duties are expected while the cashier is still being held responsible for making sales and customer service. Constantly running from one area to another when a customer goes to the register because the manger was in the office."
bad,Started out a good place to work but too many people overworked and underpaid. I will not work there again. Discrimination and racism is real even on the job
bad,"When I started at Dollar General I was pretty young, but I wasn't lazy. I found that with this minimum wage job, it was hard to work with coworkers willing to pull their own weight. It was very much a moving kind of job. I was constantly walking around."
bad,"the management was a mess and the work environment was horribly."
bad,"Decent company that preaches work/life balance but, doea not truly allow you to have it. Been told many times that, ""you're salaried and that's what it takes,"" when discussing the difficulties of having a life outside of work with my managers."
bad,That store is not a good place to work they are rude and unprofessional. the store manager feels like she can talk to you any kind of way and they don't pay the right amount for the type of work you do
bad,"A Typical day was setting the cashiers up in the morning, stocking, signing in vendors."
bad,"Not giving duties to match skills. Glorified cashier!  Told it would be full time, it is not! Not using manger experience, being put under lead person, instead of managing."
bad,"Not my favorite place to work, but not so bad that I would never go back. The manager I had was terrible and hated me for the reason that I talked too much to the customers while working the register and for also talking to my coworkers as though I wasn't working as well. She made me cry multiple times for yelling at me when she had no right to yell at me for not appearing to be doing my job, when the other two workers could clearly tell  that I was doing exactly what she had told me to do."
bad,"clock in"
bad,"Everything was way too stressful, no one knew how to stock the shelves right, everything was out of place. Way to packed and not enough room to move.."
bad,More work than it's worth what they pay. Manager was gone all the time. I had to work 100 plus hours because manager always called in and had me working all the time.
bad,Expected to complete multiple tasks with little to no help. Hours are long and quite often required to work alone. Pay is not equal to amount of work/hours required do job correctly.
bad,"very fast paced environment ,trying to stock shelves between waiting on customers, as soon as you walk away from cash register someone comes for you to check them out"
bad,dollar general is a very stressful place to work for just been a retail store that isn't that big. the manager at the time down talked employees by calling them fat or lazy in front of customers and other employees. wouldn't show up for their shifts most of the time so I would have to work them because we didn't have an assistant manager and I was the next full time person that could open and close the store and could do paperwork and stuff
bad,"They have great benefits,  and paid holidays. But they expect tou to do way more work tgen is possible in a day. The hours are often long but you work alone a lot of the time in the mornings so you cant get alot done."
bad,While working at dollar general in high school I enjoyed employment there until a certain point when my hours were cut out of nowhere and I could not seem to get a decent check
bad,"I really enjoy working at Dollar General, but the pay is what actually will make you not like this job. I feel like I put a lot of time into this job every week, and when I get paid on Friday! It absolutely feels like a waste of my time! We are paid weekly. In order for me to get a descent paycheck I would need to work Monday through Sunday at least 8 hours a day, because I'm part time. It's really not worth the time. This is most definitely one reason why they have such a high turnover. It feels like your working for free. They require you to do more than they are willing to compensate for."
bad,"the typical day of work was to work on the cashier , walk around the store restock the shelfs if needed and help the customers. the management was great they taught me well and gave me the tools that i need to be successful for the job. What i learned was the customers is always right."
bad,"Fast pace, constant work, productive work days. Every customer service job is not the same by any means. Management actually have to do work, paper work and help out around the store. Works call off a lot, you are the help and there's no team work. Being the hardest at work everyday you come and looking forward to tomorrow. Your everyday customer that come to see you and you make they day, by help them find what they looking for."
bad,"I worked here for about a year and the location was very good considering it was one of the 2 stores in the town, very busy. Taught me a lot about time management and company functions. I would apply in the future under new management. The employees that worked here were the best part of the job. Very weird polices though."
bad,Dollar General works their people hard. They want a lot out of the minimum wage workers especially. The managers are worked to death. They never give the store enough hours for the workers.
bad,"When I was hired, I was promised between 20-30 hours a week. On average, I got 15 or less even after I was promoted to Key Holder.The pay was a bit above minimum wage, but the hours were so few it didn't make a difference. Also, the only holiday I was paid extra for working was Thanksgiving. Easter was a no go. So was Christmas Eve (even though I had to stay till 10:00pm!)"
bad,"It is not an employee friendly environment and I would not suggest except as a temporary position.  Working conditions are lacking, management at my store hid her negligent actions by negative treatment of staff."
bad,manager did not want to work around my school schedule or my other job was unfair  and  did alot of favortism which i did not like didnt like the way she talk to me and she always bad talking to me  when i first started it there was something off because she was talking to the associate unfair and she would only  schedule the people she liked
bad,Dollar general does not pay well they expect the employee to do multiple jobs but don't pay them but for one it is not a good company to work for as pay or benefits they do not give good hours
bad,Always something to do shifts go by fast. Moving people from store to store does not seem productive. Employee training is lacking not enough time given for proper training.
bad,Great place to learn about retail and customers service. Enjoyed the responsibilities that I had while working there. The customers really make your day sometimes. I always enjoyed helping people in my community with their everyday needs
bad,If you have issues getting hired Dollar General is always hiring. Not for a good reason. Do not apply if you are a young person who could be hired somewhere else. Dangerous.
bad,I loved this job when I first had it. I soon realized the company was not what I hoped for and wasn't in my interest. The hardest part about this job was standing up for myself in certain situations. The best part about this job was I got to travel a lot.
bad,"Dollar tree was a very different experience,a lot of work for little pay. I experienced favortisim the little bit of time I was with them. I really didnt learn to much from what I already knew. Its not something I would do again,which was moving pallets,stocking shelves."
bad,"a good learning experience for new assistant managers. smaller stores to help with learning how to manage people , schedules and inventory procedures."
bad,"I was poorly trained. computer training and sent on my way to stock."
bad,"You definately learn time management at this job.  You have many things that need to be finished on each shift, and being busy with customers is not an excuse.  You are go, go, go your entire time there!"
bad,"My manager insists on keeping people on the schedule that are no-call/no-shows instead of splitting the hours for the employees who actually want to work, and are good workers. I'm never late, in fact I usually show up about 10-15 minutes early every day I'm scheduled to work. And I always come in when they call me to cover a shift. My hours have been cut since the old manager came back from being district manager. I'm entirely reliable to come in on time, and yet I can do no right! Instead of constructive criticism, it's nothing but negative. My manager doesn't understand why I don't know how to do certain tasks, even though I haven't been trained to do everything. I'm a shift lead, but 80% of the time I'm there I'm on the register, instead of her training me to do those tasks she thinks I should be able to do."
bad,This was a great place to work . Although I had to work 3 jobs to make ends meet. The pay wasn't enough to support my family. there also was no healthcare available.  I although work here again.
bad,"This was ok place to work, corporate never helped with anything at all, all they did was bark orders and give no support to the me or the employees working there."
bad,Work extreme hours per week. You have no time for anything else. Horrible consideration for any type of work/life balance. Would not recomend at all..
bad,"The job it's calm and relaxing . Flexible hours , friendly . However when it comes to communication skills the hiring manager lacks it  but the other managers are great"
bad,"The company continues to treat its employees like chattle. They firmly believe that if you work for them, they own you. You are expected to be on call using your personal phone 24/7. The company pays no reimbursement for those phone calls, or having to return to the store repeatedly to cover shifts or fix problems."
bad,You are made fo believe you can advance here. You are not appreciated for anything you do even if its coming in on daya off or working over. I would not recommend this place to anyone
bad,"it's a alright place to work. I don't like it because of the pay, I work so hard for no money at all. it's a waste of time and energy.  the boss is all over the place with schedule and it's not fair to the workers who got hired on night shift working morning shift. get right ups for little things like accidentally leaving keys in cash registers. but if the boss does it she don't get in trouble. I dont know I just don't like this job.. I love the Customer's and the ladies I work with and that is it."
bad,It was an ok place the manager was very rude and hateful but I had a new born baby so u couldn't leave but the customers were very courteous and patient during rushes and things being out of stock temporarily.
bad,"Ran cash register and stocked, with only two and sometimes no fellow workers in store at any given time. Store open from 8 AM to (  PM and manned by total of six employees. Local management was exceptional. Upper management was incompetent."
bad,They work work you a lot for very little amount of money.  People calling in all the time.  It was drama everyday between the workers and supervisors.  No chance for advancement or a raise.
bad,"Warehouse impacted easily no communication between stores and warehouse purge, DM at the time we had 6 of them in a years time so there was no real leadership."
bad,"As a District Manager, we are responsible for all aspects of total store operations. The day starts off at 5am. I go online and view all figures from P and L, to labor, to customer service, etc. I document my plan for day, and communicate on conference call. Loss prevention documents are viewed daily also. I visit stores about 3-5 days a week. I communicate, and validate execution of all company policies. Phone and email communication on an hourly basis."
bad,I worked in repack. I am 5'0 and was having problems reaching and getting product from the top shelves from level one. I did much better on level 2 and 3 but they kept moving me back to level one. Half of the people in that dept quit. They decided to be more lenient on absences rather than to help out the people that are coming in everyday and are busting their butt but not quite making 100% consistently.
bad,"Met alot of great customers, really friendly. Store was stocked and cleaned everyday. It was easy waking up in the early mornimgs. Always unloaded the truck."
bad,"No matter how hard we would work it was never good enough. There was always complaints from the manager, but the customers always told us how they appreciated us and how we kept the store organized."
bad,they dont give you hardly any hours and only pay you the very minimum. they expect to much out of a persom in the short time they assign. its hard to make it on the very slim paychecks.
bad,Terrible place to work! They do not care about their employees! Pay is awful and management is very very AWFUL!!!!! Most stores are usually under staffed which is why nothing can get done because you have to have a full staff to run that place! They always order way more inventory than what is needed no matter the size of the store. The stores stay nasty and merchandise is EVERYWHERE!!!!
bad,I really enjoyed my time there. Some people didn't make it easy but the customers were awesome. I would tell people to shop there it's just the company always have different itenarary
bad,"A typical day at work is ok. U may work the cash register or do totes, whatever has to be done that day. Good job for a college student. Room for advancement."
bad,cuts hours till you quit bad management not alot of people to work with the few people you worked with were good people but the company was badly managed
bad,What I learned from working at dollar general was learning how to multi task. There was so much work that needed to be done as well as ringing out customers. Very high pace job.
bad,Work days and hours were always changing. High demands but with little assistance. It was always busy so you were never bored. Employee moral wanted that great.
bad,Went to work for them leaving a fast food place thinking it was gonna be better and stable hours. Also I wanted to work there because it was closer to home and wouldn't have to travel as far during the winter. Went from having over 30 hours a week down to 12 hrs when I was told I would be getting at least 20 hrs a week. The manager is constantly either having us come in at a later time or having us leaving early because of not having the payroll. We have one too many asst. managers that we don't need for a small store. District manager doesn't call back either.
bad,DG is very demanding and don't want to pay much. You can move up fast because of the turnover rate. The Corporate Office controls your every move including the temperature of the building and the lighting in the store.
bad,It could bn better if I had more hours.. I only had 10 hours a week.. I worked with a few good people.. Not a enough hours to make a living .. Shifts were from six in the morning to two Or  2 to 9
bad,Working for Dollar General as a Store Manager I was asked by the Distribution Manager to ask my associates to work off the clock to meet budget. Also associates not present must pencil whip that they were to avoid failing audits
bad,The company over works there employees / managers are on salary and has to take up any slack I had very little time for my family / The longer you work there the more they take advantage of you / they never give you enough hours to keep the store in order or to hire enough people
bad,Management is pretty hard on the staff and lack confidence in the team they build. They require you to do a lot of work that is impossible to get done in the time you have especially with customers needing the attention they need. if they had 2 cashiers and 1 management staff available at all times the customers would get the attention they desire and their employees would not get yelled at for not being able to finish the required jobs. I believe every store would have more of the ability to make the store as successful as they want it to be without stressing out the management enough to take it out on the employees.  This causing a high turnover rate. I understand you have a certain amount of hour you are allow to use but the work load over compensates for the amount of people and hours allow.
bad,"Dollar General was not my favorite job, however I gained experience in customer service that later helped me receive a promotion later on in my work journey. Management was not the best, however I made the best of what I was given. Always had regular customers I bonded with which helped my work day and was a joy to see!"
bad,Upper management does not care about the employees unless your a store manager or a assistant your voice is mute . Managers are petty and childish resulting in good workers quitting or getting fired . The more effort you put in the more u realize no one cares and they will use you and take advantage till you simply cannot take it . They need the DM's to pay more attention to the individual stores and whats happening in them.
bad,"full time employees only get 30 hours a week. schedules are very flexible. difficult to support a family on, due to lack of hours. easy work, just not enough hours"
bad,A typical day at work for me is make sure the store is running properly when the store manager is not their. I would describe my job as fast pace. The hardest part of my job is working the truck which is based on lifting heavy boxes. That's the most stressful thing bout my job.
bad,I really didn't enjoy working at the dollar store it was a good job to help others and meet new people but I didn't like the hours and the rude customers .
bad,A very demanding company with low compensation and a lack of appreciation for the hard work their employees put forth. It was nothing to work 70-90 hours a week to have a model store. I never got reimbursed for my mileage after traveling to help at several inventories.
bad,The people I worked with made it fun to work there and we would always help each other out with whatever we needed. We all would stick together and treated each other like family.
bad,"Not guaranteed hours, no room for advancement, not enough employees and just the worst place ever. Meant to be a part time job a couple hours a week not a job to live off of. Doesn't like to pay more then minimum wage."
bad,There needs to be better communication between management and employees.  There seemed to be quite a bit of favoritism shown to  select individuals.  Management at times brought their home life into work and left employees to do everything and then would leave in the busiest time of day.
bad,The position is good if you are between jobs or young and needing work experience but a stepping stone is a stepping stone
bad,"You don't really get many hours in these kind o store and you get paid minimum wage, but it can be a good place to work I you just want a part time job."
bad,This company focuses on rewarding their board and ceo's rather than lower level employees.  Store managers are expected to deliver high level results with out adequate means.
bad,"Learned a lot about retail, sales. Worked part time, min wage. "
bad,"Upper management, starting with moody district manager has very unrealistic expectations of what can be accomplished as far as getting stock on shelves and facing shelves when running a busy store with only 2 employees in the store at one time. They set the head store manager up to fail no matter how hard they and their staff works. Store here has gone through head store managers. Staff get stressed and burned out and are paid minimum wage or if lead associate (shift manager on duty) you get a whole extra 50 cents an hour.  The atmosphere is very negative because every one knows corporate and upper management doesn't care about their employees."
bad,Not much hours menum wag smooth place to work have bout 5 to 6 ubouts to cashiers be busy sometimes. I did both making sure stuff is pulled to edge of the shelf making nothing is on the floor for no one fall cleaning up making sure you ask for id looking around the store to see if anyone is stilling anything
bad,I really disliked working at dollar general because they never seemed to have enough people working and helping out. Lines would get big and customers would get mad but the managers wouldn't help.
bad,"Truly a terrible place to work. Not only is the pay very low, but the hours are completely inconsistent and a lot is expected of you. Almost always running a skeleton crew, a lot of work is expected of you."
bad,"I will never work for Dollar General ever again, at least at the store level.  The pay was terrible.  I worked there for two years and they wouldn't give me one of my annual .25 raises.  The turnover rate is ridiculous.  People constantly quit, that's both supervisor and non-supervisor positions.  I liked my store managers.  They did what they could to make the place more enjoyable."
bad,"We come in to work not being told how long we will be at work, job threaten as well as overworked. The system thats in place makes it hard for employers to make production. The job does pay well but I am a student looking to better myself and it was not for me and my schedule."
bad,"I learned a lot working here, I learned how to operate a cash registar , I enjoyed helping coustomers and I enjoy sales. The manangment staff should have been a little better but no complaints about the rest ."
bad,typical day was long but rewarding. learned a lot about various cleaning products and equipment. management was helpful. Co-workers were nice. hardest part of job was staying over. enjoyable part was serving the community.
bad,"hardworking, good customer service, management is ok and co-workers are ok to work with.  The hardest part of this job is keeping the store clean."
bad,"Awful environment if you are a family man,great environment if you want to make your dm and rvp wealthy.Not a family oriented company at all.Expects too much from its managers, hence the gigantic turnover"
bad,i learned how to work safely the co-workers was nice it just wasn't enough cash the hardest part was waking up going knowing i could do better .
bad,It was good job but i wish i never got fired and was making more money. I did hard work but I guess something went wrong and i hit the wrong thing and it was mistake but the manger  didn't wanted to hear that
bad,Dollar General is a great workplace for teens DAT jus got out of school with hardly no bills ..But as an adult its pretty rough because your barely getting hours.
bad,The manager of the store tended to disappear leaving the associates high and dry. The place was sometimes clean. The hours of your week were cut if they did not favor you. You did not get a pleasant feeling any time you entered the store.
bad,"the upper management was new while I worked there.  Typical day was about 13 hours long.  Supervising hourly employees, interview new candidates and handle disciplinary actions."
bad,"It's a exciting place to work. The manager is very understanding, person. Working there give me life to keep going. It's the staff that keep me coming back to work."
bad,"It is a good job, but productivity is everything. It's all a numbers game for production, sales, and communication. I care about my people, leadership, and sales as most important."
bad,The customers are one-sided and difficult to deal with. The floors are always dirty and the aisles are always blocked. Poor training and unprofessional and biased management. This company cares nothing for their employees. Don't they know that happy employees make for happy customers?! The assistant manager is extremely rude to new hires. The more seasoned employees chase the new hires off and then complain about the extra work put on them. They're stupid to say the least. The one good thing? Work/Life balance.
bad,"When I first applied for this job, I was informed that their workforce was severely lacking. The manager/interviewer even made a point to show me the cashier that was on duty, on the security feed, stating that she is a part time employee who is having to work a 40 hour week, because they were so understaffed."
bad,I liked working at Dollar general but they started shorting me on my checks. They shorted me whole days pay on my first check did not add to my second check like they said they would then shorted me an additional $14 on my second check. Corporate and payroll put me on hold then hung up on me so I quit. Then on my last check they gave me they shorted me $36 I called the district manger I left a voicemail and he never replied.
bad,Learned a lot about customer service. Also learned how to operate a cash register. My co- workers made it fun and enjoyable.
bad,"The day I started I was suppose to start with training videos, but as soon as I walked in the door they put me on a register I wasn't even trained on. I was constantly corrected by the regional manager that I was not doing something to company standards. It's hard to maintain company standards that were not taught to you."
bad,working for small wages and battling with too many managers. The store I worked at had a manager that would hire men for their looks.
bad,I was a manager and enjoyed managing the store. I treated everyone right and learned a lot while working with others. This was a great experience working as a manager.
bad,"At Dollar General there is a lot of stocking and customer service.It is more than stand behind the counter and look cute we get down and dirty everyday with stocking, cleaning the store and dealing with a lot of customers everyday.I love 98 percent of our customers they are a good bunch of people but you always have that one or two customers that are having a bad day that want to drag you down with them. I just smile and tell them to have a good day.I have a lot of fun with my coworkers and the manager himself for the most part.We all have a mutual respect for each other and that is what makes it work.It is not the job or the people that have me concerned. I have been there for a very long time and Dollar General just does not want to pay their employees very well. I live alone now and I only have my income and it just is not paying the bills."
bad,"typical work day consisted of working the register, stocking merchandise, and keeping the store organized. Hardest part of job the long hour shifts."
bad,"It was a friendly environment, but they have no compassion for people, don't really care about employees! You can move up quickly, but they don't really give raises. Employees leave quickly, also."
bad,"* Typical day at work includes stocking, running register, recovering the store, etc."
bad,"I would close the store or open the store everyday, stock and recover the whole store and unload trucks. The nice part of the job was my regular customers. Not a good job."
bad,Glad I had the customers to keep me determined! I showed up at the interview with my resume' and that seemed to give off a bad impression.
bad,This store was very unmanageable. The people I worked with were very irresponsible. For this to be my first job it almost ruined my experience with retail and sales.
bad,"District and Regional Management treats every store as if it was the same, not taking in account the area the store is positioned or size of the store. So a small store in heavily populated area with no room to place merchandise will receive less merchandise than that of a big store in a small environment, which will receive many items to sell, but will always have more expired products than new. "
bad,"There was always replenishment to do, and because of the location it was always slow, and the hours were low. I liked being a manager but i didn't like being in the store for hours by myself with no help"
bad,"A typical day at work as a lead sales associate consists of opening the store (preparing tills, counting the change fund), getting the cashier (sales associate) something to stock if it is a stock day (cashier is to work stock between customers), work my stock, and provide backup to the cashier when needed. On non stock days I would recover (front face) the back of the store while the associate recovered the front. Some days would be spent resetting planograms which just means removing old labels on a shelve, adding new labels and clearancing out discontinued items."
bad,they work you like a dog but dont give you the pay that you deserve. they don't listen to reason. employees do what they want
bad,mangement wasn't the best also a lot of confusion in workplace. coworkers were good as well as customers but when asked to take days off they would be denied wasn't able to have life outside the workplace
bad,All in all it was a good place to work. I liked working with the customers. I also liked making the schedules and counting the till
bad,"I was very unhappy at the end of my time with Dollar General.  My store manager was amazing but the district manager however was not.  I was asked to help run a different store.  I took this as a great learning experience and was willing to help.  A learning experience that was supposed to be 2 weeks, turned out to be 6 months and my position within my store was given to another employee.  I decided to leave after working 10 to 15 hr days 6 to 7 days a week for 6 months."
bad,Working at dollar general was stressful management didn't preform professional when need be. the store was messy and there was lack of communication when it came to employees and management.
bad,Typical day at Dollar General was busy. There was not much time to do anything but what was asked of you that day. I learned I could multitask very well. My management was not very efficient. The hardest part of the job was the day our supplies were delivered. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the customers. Most of everyone who came in were the same people I would see on a regular basis.
bad,"Work consisted of coming in and getting straight to work and by work, I mean running consistently for 10+ hours. It was a very immature work environment and the hardest part of the job was running all night. There was no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Unless you need a job that bad, DO NOT work for this company. The wages are terrible, and the management is even worse. This location is bad too, you do one bad thing and the manager automatically hates you."
bad,The management there while I was there was very bad and not good to work with at all. Store is a mess and they dont give many hours.
bad,"I have worked for Dollar General at two different stores. Their policies for cashiers are degrading. I have worked for other companies who allowed more freedom for things like voiding an item without having to call a manger to turn a key. I understand that theft is a concern, however  - I believe most employees who feel trusted and appreciated will perform better."
bad,great place to start a career in retail if you are going for small box management.  teaches you how to grow quick and face challenges of running a full store completely by yourself with minimum help from peers or upper management
bad,"I really enjoy the type of work and working with the customers for the most part. The hours went from part time to full time. and management changed and the working atmosphere changed to where we are searched before leaving work, and having to write down everything we do at work."
bad,Not a particularly well-run company unfortunately.  Too demanding on their limited staff.  Not paid enough for the amount of work that is required.  Often left alone for several hours a day making for a very unsafe work environment.
bad,"Not much to say aside from the pros and cons... But I would not recommend any one to work there without doing your research on them. My mistake was to work there immediately despite of what I had heard upon hirement, never again."
bad,Very easy laid back place. typical day was arranging merchandise and operating cash register. there was no hard part to this job! The entire job was pretty basic and easy.
bad,"Hectic job, constant moving, expectations of manager sometimes extreme for time frame, very rude customers, wage is very low"
bad,"moved up from just a cashier to a night lead in no time. but as i was pregnant the manager would stock all the paper products on truck days, then leave all the canned goods and dog food to me.i was pregnant so i didnt like that to much. very low pay at the time at 6.00"
bad,"66 hours per week, steady work, fast-paced.  Work hard, spend a lot of time at work.  Nice weather, laid back, sometimes.  Growth opportunities do exist."
bad,dollar general is a good place to work for if you have a great management team and a good crew other wise it is very stressful and they make you do a lot more work for a lot less money
bad,"This management isn't the greatest. Most of my co-workers are awesome, but the managers aren't very professional with their work ethic."
bad,I worked with many different people and the days go by fast you are never bored there is always so much to do. The job is hard work and you are always stocking and putting things in their home spots. The job is enjoyable when you make your customers happy or you see that you did better than your goals.
bad,At dollar general honestly it just depend on your luck that night. We would have customers that would want to fight with you cause you would catch them stealing. But co-workers are very friendly and good workers but tend to see all of new face due to the amount of stealing .
bad,The company over works and under staffs daily. The expect so much but help so little. Also the management does not care for there workers.
bad,"A typical day is being told everything you've done wrong and expected to make the store 10000% with just two people working (1 on register and 1 off)."
bad,"they only had two people closing everyday, which lead to being tired everyday.  they never let you take a break, because there was no one to cover you."
bad,I had a good experience with Dollar General.I learned alot about myself and how i should handle myself in many different situations.
bad,The company has changed drastically over the years. At first it seems like a nice company until they cut your hours drastically and start to make you feel out of place and like your best isn't good enough.
bad,"If you have never work before, this would be a good place to start out at. You not only learn customer service but also retail."
bad,managers were terrible. Pay was terrible. Daily tasks were terrible. Everything was terrible. Never going back there again.
bad,back breaking for the low pay rate you get. you cant really talk to co workers and its really stressful I would rather work in walmart they pay more.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was organizing, cleaning, and watching for thievery. Multi-tasking everyday sometimes without assistance from management."
bad,"Worked there for over a year....management was nice, pay could use some improvement.  Enjoyed the working schedule and the customers.  Manager was very flexible with schedules."
bad,Nice people to work with but the hours are crazy with no set schedule. Hard to keep this job if you have children at home. I would not recommend to someone who is a single parent.
bad,"Dollar General has low prices, in order to keep them low however, they will work their managers on 25-35k salaries for 60-70 hours a week. These hours do not count towards payroll and they give the store no hours to assign to anyone else. Prices are continuing to lower under new corporate management, thus meaning that even less hours will be given. I am an ASM at the corporate store in Madison, TN (making 9.65 an hour, which is very low for an ASM position when compared to other retail store) and it is an okay yet demanding job; the mundane people and tasks you must deal with day in and day out will wear on you. This is also not the right job for me because I am a full-time college student as well. I am looking for something else before my life gets run into the ground."
bad,Ok company. They did not provide benefits. Hours were short per week. Starting pay was also low. I would not go back. Thankful for 1st job
bad,not really what I expected as far as salary  and work environment. The staff isn't as concerned about there new employees as they should be. Maybe every one have a different opinion.
bad,"You are set up on production,but not rewarded for over production. Management team only manages people and not processes.All about the numbers. Under developed management team."
bad,In this job there is alot of hard work required with very little  benifits. They do not offer enough hours or any pay raises no matter how long you have worked there. Good starter job
bad,"My store was a nightmare to work at. The management did not seem as though they knew how to do their jobs. They were petty, full of drama, and could not keep their employees in line. People were always calling out at the last minute, and we went through employees very quickly due to management being rude and unfair to them, doing things such as calling them names and accusing people of stealing money. I feel as though Dollar General in general would be an okay company to work for, however the corporation does not pay enough for the duties required to be performed, in my opinion."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General consist of you making sure that the customers find everything ok, cleaning and stocking the store, and trying to stop people from stealing the merchandise. The people that you work in the store with will feel like a work family. the main manager does not care, she wants you to get to work and work your butt off, even if you have no transportation to work (because your having car problems) or even if you are as sick as a dog. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off work, and getting paid (which is not much a all)."
bad,"The customers were the best part about the job, the management changed a lot of times through the 3 months I was with the company."
bad,"I went in ran a register and stocked shelves. I learned to work with many different kinds of people. The management was not good at working with employees. The co-workers didn't want to do much work, except what was absolutely required. The hardest part was the physical labor part of the job. The most enjoyable part was working with different people."
bad,To me the same as Family Dollar. I enjoyed this company because of the customers. This company never solves issues they just drag the process of solving the issue out. Most of the problems with this company has a lot to do with the DMs and the Managers.
bad,Great place of work.... I enjoyed my stint with Dollar General I can't really say anything bad about the company besides the pay and hours. I learned how to adapt to any working environment. Management was Ok. Could of been better but hey its life you live and you learn. I enjoyed all co workers we all worked as a team for the most part. The hardest part of the job was truck day. The most enjoyable part of the day is closing time
bad,"I didn't like working there. The company was unorganized, the management and employees were rude, and the hours wasn't enough."
bad,I felt over worked for the amount I was being paid to work. There was a lack of worked done by management. There were unrealistic tasks that management wanted completed.
bad,"I worked there for 9 months and I went thru 4 different managers in that time frame, and the final one fired me because of my recovery, and after I got fired, the manager herself got fired, and nobody I worked with is working at that location anymore, nobody is secure, and I guarantee you that you will not advance at all, even if you are the best employee there like I was.  I'm not trying to be cocky, but I got complemented by customers on a daily basis, but yet they fired me, hmmmm, that's fishy."
bad,"A typical day at work is meeting people, seeing the everyday customers and new ones."
bad,Great experience. Got to learn alot about management but the team work wasn't there. Very bad communication and slackers.
bad,I did not like my job at Dollar General. They stores are very unorganized the managers are rude and mean to employees the pay there is terrible and the don't give raises.
bad,dollar general was an ok place to work. I liked it the experience was ok. the employers  were ok people to work with. the customers were very different. but overall it was an ok job.
bad,I would arrive at 6am to help get the store ready for opening. I would have to work as a cashier as well as stock. I learned that I work fast and well under pressure. The hardest part of my job was going above and beyond and not getting any recognition for it. the most enjoyable part of my day was going home.
bad,A typical day at Dollar General Distrinution is 11-12 hours.  It really could be a great place to work but the complete lack of respect for the employees overshadows all the good.
bad,They do not care about their employees at all and always are cutting hours. They want you to work but do not want to pay anything and you can never get more than 20 hours
bad,"Working for Dollar General was a waste of time. The management really don't care about you they just want you to fill a stop. I got moved around from store to store to help clean up the mess they left, when I would get the store back right it never failed they'd move me again. Then I got word they were saying I didnt do the work that all I did was sit in the office and waste time (not true) when I asked about this no one would give me an answer. What topped the cake was a manager had a heart attack and died in the store, and they wouldnt even shut the store down, or let the employees off to go to the funeral. It is a filler job, a job you may need to just get a paycheck dont expect for them to treat you like family or even a human sometimes. Very little pay."
bad,"A typical day at work was sort of depressing. The atmosphere was real dark to me and made me not want to be there. My manager was extremely hard on my on the very first day. I say that because me and my best friend had got a job there on the same week and she told me that her first day was easy and she only had to do one basket full of stocking, and she didn't even finish it all. On my first day I did TWO whole U-boats full of boxes by myself. Mind you this is my first time ever working in retail, so I was doing pretty good. The manger kept coming to me and saying ""You aren't done yet?"" Then I had to do two empty shelves and clean them both and stock them both. I was almost on my third U-boat for the day and she told me it was time for me to get off and I needed to work on my speed. Mind you these U-boats are always filled to the top with boxes you have to cut open and break down, and the stock them in the right place and that could be sometimes anywhere in the store. On my third day I was told to do the cash register and the assistant manager ran through how to do work it really fast and the next thing I know I had a customer with a check and I had no idea what to do because she didn't show me at first. Then she had to do it in front of the customer which made me feel terrible. I just wasn't properly trained there and I honestly hated it."
bad,this job had a pretty friendly and energetic environment it just didn't pay enough. It was also hard to have a social life and work.
bad,I worked random shifts. I learned how to operate a register. My co-workers wasn't the best. The hardest part was working in a environment that really didn't want me there.
bad,My day started sometimes at 5pm and ended at 10pm. I learned how to work a cash register. I also learned how to stock shelves. I didn't like how situations was being handled at Dollar General.
bad,"A typical day at work meant, going in and assisting on the register, until the lines are down. I have learned that i can not please everybody all the time, but i can do my best. I enjoyed all my co-workers ,because we all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was not having enough help. The most enjoyable was knowing i and my co-workers were giving our 100 percent all the time"
bad,I learned a lot working there but its not a place where you want to stay long term.
bad,"The store was a complete wreak! No organization, no cleanliness, no structure, a training store manager, just a mess."
bad,The job as a sales associate a dollar general is okay but its somewhere you should only be for about 1year no more than because the pay is not so good and there is a lot of better jobs out there the company is not organized at all the system is always going down and the prices always go up in the store without even letting associates know ..To sum it all up DOLLAR GENERAL ONLY CAUSE STRESS
bad,"I started working here as a regular cashier/associate, then quickly worked my way up to a management position in less than 2 months. At first it seemed like I was really appreciated in the company, but soon after accepting my new position it was nothing but constant grief."
bad,i didnt really care for this job as much as my extrenship! it was to much work for little pay.
bad,"the hardest thing at work was making sure all of ur customers were happy so that they would come back"
bad,"A typical day at work with Dollar General was very busy. I learned to handle irritated customers well. Management was somewhat understanding with your personal life. Co-workers were somewhat reliable. The hardest part of the job was not being able to take a much needed break, and the most enjoyable part of the job was management working around my personal life schedule."
bad,It was a good first job to have. It had a decent work environment and was close to home
bad,minimum wage i can't do. although it had good benefits i would like to know that i'm getting paid good for what i do
bad,"I have learned why they have a high turn over with employees, the respect is absent. I am sure some one has had a good experience though-just not me."
bad,"I worked a lot of hard long hours little pay. I did cashiering, unload trucks, ordering, making schedules, telephone conferences, inventory  organization, setting planograms."
bad,"easy job, basic retail work, doing the same thing over and over everyday"
bad,"Could use better teamwork"
bad,"A typical day's work was cashing out customers, stocking shelves, helping customers find items, and clean the store."
bad,Working at Dollar General takes a lot of energy and people skills. A continuous stream of customers coming through the checkout line and some are upset and take it out on you. Stocking is never ending at Dollar General and the hours are demanding.
bad,"I'm laid back but determined to get the job done. Success is a must in any task I undertake.  If you need someone to ensure things get done, then look no further."
bad,As a 3rd key i took on more responsibility that I wanted and was willing to learn. The company wasn't the best at keeping their word or awarding their workers. I worked with good people at times. Other times I was catching associates stealing. I felt like the company didn't appreciate their employees.
bad,The best part of the job are the customers and the co-workers. For the worst part I'd have to say management and the work load only to get paid minimum wage.
bad,"Only worked two days a week."
bad,"open the store, set up, sidewalk sale, customer service. hardest part is no time for my family and working every weekend"
bad,"Work at Dollar General was a fair company to work for. There is so much to learn such as cashier, stock, inventory, etc. Management needs to be a bit more involved. The hardest part of the job is the low compensation for associates. Although this is a very friendly environment with good customer service is a plus."
bad,"I really enjoyed my customers and employees. The management system was poor. I went months without a GM, and a month or so without a assistant manager. It does give you the opportunity to move up fast, but I would not work there again if offered."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of working the cash register, then stocking shelves during down time. Management was helpful sometimes, but very unfair. My co-workers were great people who happened to have big dreams like myself, which made it a joy working side by side with them. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was working side by side with my co-workers."
bad,There is no job security. The hardest part of the job was working with the corruption.
bad,"This is a job where you work and mo work. The job requires a lot running and picking of different size packages. Some are heavy some light. You do a lot of lifting on this job. The biggest problem on this job is management. Management/Supervisors are not there to help you. Some will but; You are on a production scale, but you don't get paid for it. You have assignments that you have to do and they management have took off the time. That way you will have to run all day long. There is not enough time on the assignments. The assignment maybe 250 pick, it use to give us at less an hour and thirty minutes to do it. It also deals with how far or how many lanes you have to travel. Some assignments you have to pick may not go but a few lanes over. They will give less time to do . But management is not fair."
bad,greet customers checked out merchandise stocked merchandise cleaned break room bathrooms maintain a clean environment
bad,I did not like working there because of the hot/cold conditions in store and not enough payroll to get everything done that was needed to get done
bad,"For me a typical day day of work was pretty tuff. I worked extremely hard i was always busy. I learned may things such as excelling in my leadership skills and muti tasking alot. Management was ok for the most part, i didnt really have the best of the best co workers. The hardest part of my job was keeping my team mates in order. The most enjoyable part of the day was putting a smile on a customers face."
bad,typical day at work consisted of sacking groceries  There wasnt alot of energy in the work place and its very dull.
bad,"Being in retail for 10 years previous to DG, I was highly disappointed after I joined the Dg family. I expected much more support from a company that had such a solid base yet did not get it. We constantly had to make due with what we had instead of getting what we needed. I was injured on the job and shortly thereafter was terminated for a bogus reason."
bad,lost my job after 2 years on FMLA leave.   hardworking co workers hardest part about the job was training new managers every 6 months
bad,The work was very easy but running it alone can be very difficult.
bad,I would start by counting my bank for the day then i would go and start my register up. Then start working on over stock or stocking in general. I learned how to deal with allot of different people. The co-workers where very nice and polite. Hardest was when there was only two people in the store at a time and we were really backed up also when the registers would go down. I enjoyed the customers that would come on a daily basis.
bad,I worked in the Coldwater branch.  I was hired by the store manager who worked her way up to manager from a cashier.  I worked while attending school.  All jobs were part-time minimum wage.
bad,"Very stressful work environment, high volume fast paced cashier responsibilties. Hands on managers with inadequate scheduling skills. Pleasant co-wokers."
bad,"Where I first learned about customers. How to run a cash box etc,"
bad,"A typical work day for me was from 6am-10pm the majority of the time I was there. The company gave very little hours to each store so therefore it caused me not to be able to hire the right amount of people I needed to get things done."
bad,the mananager at dollar general were way to ungrateful. He never told you what you were doing right only what you were doing work
bad,"I have worked in two separate stores; both with very different atmospheres. "
bad,"require too much work for the salary"
bad,"Managers do most the work due small budgets to work with,"
bad,a lot to do with little pay. To many chiefs not enough indians
bad,"Schedule is in constant flux, even after being posted, hours are changed without telling employees, you are written up if you miss a shift even if it was changed and you didn't know you were suppose to be there. High turnover rate of employees and key carriers."
bad,It got to be too be too much when you are there 7 days a week open to close and have to do everything in the store.
bad,This is a very demanding company to work for. Your day consists of being pulled in many different directions. If you enjoy high stress and long days this is the job for you.
bad,I am not one that like working for this company due to of its lack in concern for its employees.
bad,I was when i left was 3rd key manager. I took care of customers. I took care of banking. I did  restocking the shelfs.
bad,"Arriving at shift I 'd count a hundred dollar till,be placed on register and begin my shift. What I learned is how to use multiple functions on the register, how to do end caps, planograms,and the sku placements. The management was disorganized very lazy and only did the real job when the DM was appearing. When in fact, everything should've been done as second nature. My co-workers were friendly, some had team effort others did not but overall they were well. the hardest part was how one had to be the cashier, and breakdown four totes a day with marjority of the time being the only cashier. The enjoyable was interacting with the people and stocking the inventory."
bad,"I only worked there a few months just as a seasonal thing,loved the people I worked with!"
bad,"The store manager was always on a smoke break. I felt bad when I had a long line of customers and they had an attitude when it was their turn to pay because the line. Manager was always grouchy, always on her cell phone. "
bad,I stocked the shelves and check out customer and help them if they needed  items in the store if they needed any help.
bad,I was constantly on the go I love the pace.I learned a lot about running a business and what trends to look for.
bad,I would make sure every customer was happy and stock selves. I also made sure all money drawers were accurate and check customers out. I cleaned when needed also
bad,i loved the people ive worked with but the job didnt pay enough for all the hard work
bad,I enjoy my job sometime ..I get alone with everybody I know  been a mag.play a big part..i like what I do do but some time it stress when everybody don't work togerther..I like talkin with my cust. and my sure they find every thing they need
bad,"i loved working for this company but i never got enough hours to continue working there,"
bad,I love the customers that come into the store. Everyone knows each other by name just about. We laugh and smile. This always makes my day at work. The co-workers are nice and a joy to work with. The managers are okay at times they can be better at training the new hires.
bad,"Hired as an Asst Str Mgr, but was promised company specific training and an advancement to Str Mgr in the very near future(2-3 weeks). This did not happen and my DM, who was brand new to the company as well, continued to promise me over and over that my training was coming very soon. I then had to take on the responsibility of the acting Str Mgr while my Str Mgr went out on medical leave. Continuously told how great I was doing and that training would come soon. Needless to say, this company is not very interested in keeping its employees happy, nor training them properly before turning them loose to run/ruin their business. Last time I checked, I've been in retail for 20+ years now, the main name of the game is to make money for the company you work for.....not so here."
bad,"my work day was overall always busy, always had something to do."
bad,It was ok to work here but it was just so boring. All you do is cashier the little customers that come into the store and stock.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of any job is to work. I love to work and learn new things. I like to better myself and my skills in many different fields. Working to my ability is a major plus,making sure I do well for the company I'm working for. "
bad,The position pays well if your body can hold out. Not everyone is built to handle such a position.
bad,"Focusing on customer needs, and making their shopping experience pleasant. Learned a lot about resetting seasonal merchandise. The hardest part of my job is the traveling 70 miles a day. Have a wonderful crew and they help make the store clean n run smooth!"
bad,Working with customer's face to face solving any issues they had and providing excellent customer service skills.
bad,Lots of hours with little pay. Incentives are hard to achieve. Pay scale so low that you can't get good help uusually.
bad,"poor workplace environment.no work life balance at all, prepare to be there 24/7"
bad,I would learn all kinds of things almost every week. I loved the customers at Dollar General. Some would bring in Christmas gifts for all the employees. They were very special to me. Without them there isn't any retail.
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company. They expected me to work for near minimum wage as an Assistant Manager. Overtime was not an option. Perhaps it was just my district that I disliked. The employees are barely educated and horrible work ethic. When I began working in the store, there was a horrible drug and alcohol problem. I tried to manage and eliminate the problems and employees and I was in returnm FIRED! For ""Overstepping my boundaries"", when I called the cops. The DISTRICT MANAGER fired me. Perhaps she was involved??"
bad,"Typically a day at work consists of unloading truck, stocking shelves, running register, performing customer service."
bad,"I will go to work and get ready to start my day. I will always give great customer service, make sure that the store is stocked for the customers."
bad,"Terrible job for an adult with a family, great for high school kids. Plenty to learn about retail. Not enough employees on shift to help with work load( stock, register). Very flexible with schedule, but not enough hours. Get your experience and move on!!"
bad,New company struggling to keep up with demands of customers.
bad,"I was third key which is assitiant manger to the assitant . My duties included stocking , order product for store , bank deposit , payroll ."
bad,Only worked 8 hours a week and 2 days a week. Didn't stay their long
bad,"A typical day at work was very busy and time-consuming. A lot was being asked to be put in a little time frame without the right amount of tools to do it with be it employees, product, or the knowledge of how to complete the task. I learned a lot of managerial procedures through trial and error and on hand working. I only learned a minimal amount through CBLs (Computer Based Learning). My management was always in disarray. I worked for 3 different assistant manager and 2 different general managers during my tenure there. Most of my co-workers were okay I enjoyed working with them, but I had a few that did not pull their weight and was not even sure how they became employed there. The hardest part of the job was when I became part of management and they ask so much of you which was not a problem, but they had a hard time compensating you for your time, and to me they did not handle business in the proper fashion. For instance they fired my general manager and promoted me to run the store until they found someone else, but I had never been trained to do so I was just learning the ropes of being an assistant manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably my regular customers. They made it fun to come to work and they always looked for me to be there, and we began to develop rapport with one another."
bad,As a manager you will work long hours and be on call all the time
bad,*walking all day loading roll tainers
bad,"A typical day of work as a shift supervisor was to motivate and remind the team the importance of customer service, notify of any sales/promotions, and lead truck team."
bad,worked with alot of people helping them in several different ways
bad,the workplace could be more professional. I never recieved proper training. The management is very poor.
bad,I would come in and have to restock shelves and when there is only one person on the register its really hard to focus on customers and workload.
bad,I enjoyed part of my time with DG...But as a manager the upper brass expected miracles out of a small labor force
bad,"worst job i have ever had, terrible management, bad staff, i took on management responsiblity while being compensated as a cashier. unprofessional bad atmosphere."
bad,"I was told in the interview I would work 7, 10 hour days and be off 6. The reality was working 8-10, 10-12 hour days with 1 or 2 days off. With only $25 a day for 3 meals, and a cap of $80 a night, you eat a lot of fast food and stay in a lot of undesirable hotels. It was truly life on the road, running up miles on your personal vehicle, with 40 cent a mile returned to you. Earned vacation, but was never allowed to use it and forfeited it apon giving and working my 2 week notice. Apparently it is company policy to not pay unused vacation."
bad,"My day is predominately concerned with customer service @ point of sale(cashier), but stocking & re-stocking also takes up a large part of my day. I enjoy most meeting & interacting with the public, & assisting them in any matters or concerns that they have. The most difficult part of my job is nightly closing, cleaning, etc."
bad,"Nice place to work, food always fresh and store always clean."
bad,Everyday was the same. I learned to address different people's attitudes in different ways. Management people skills were horrible. My co-workers were annoying and only cared for themselves.
bad,"When I worked for them they were highly unorganized. The only reason I stayed was for little pay that I did get. Don't think your gonna get promoted, because I was up for the Assistant Manager position and they told me I was to young."
bad,Really like the job other than the amount of time I had to be there. If the company provide a different way for supporting payroll it would be a better place to work.
bad,"The salary did not equal in fairness to the work load, the job was enjoyable."
bad,"The company constantly treats the cashiers like they are stealing, there is almost 0 advance notice on your scheduling, the pay is minimum wage, and their computers are outdated."
bad,I received a total of twenty minutes of training. I was constantly reprimanded for doing things incorrectly when no one made me aware of the proper way. Inflexible with scheduling. Total lack of respect toward employees and customers.
bad,the job was ok but the manager was unfair there was to many workers and no hours i was bringing home 27 dollar checks
bad,This company did not give support to the managers. I was not happy in this job at all.
bad,"Working with customers, customer service, phone, cashiering, selling,"
bad,often you are put down by others are the supervisors tend to ignore issues. if you have a family issue then the supervisors treat you worse and they over work you. they will never help when you need help they just judge you.
bad,"First time in retail but they expect way to much for way to little. I'm supposed to be training to get my own store which only comes with the promise of possibly one and a half days off a week (all store mgrs are allowed). I missed 3 days of work due to having bronchitis recently and was treated like I was lying and let the entire corporation down. Felt like the district mgr was slightly threatening me when she contacted me about coming back to work but have a dr. excuse, meds and the cough to prove it. Am currently looking for another job...."
bad,All the manager cared for was that someone  was there for  the store.  She wasn't  friendly and once I was a key holder. I had many shifts  were  I was in the store  by myself  for 6 hours.  Lots if times she didn't  even have enough money  in the store for  several  days and didn't  change the amount she was  getting.  It was a struggle  working  there.
bad,"It's a job that pays the bills. Disappointment awaits those hoping for something that provides a sense of fulfillment, is enjoyable, or is mentally engaging. (Or a truly set schedule.) Mandatory overtime is frequent and can hardly be offset by use of paid time off, given the restrictions on scheduling."
bad,The company wants way too much work done. It's impossible to do 1 rolltainer an hour. 5 totes in a half hour and all while your helping customers and ringing on register. Managers have NO LIFE OR FREE TIME FOR FAMILY! It's not a good place to work.
bad,Start pay is great. Work is guaranteed. Benefits are way to high and company declines your rights to benefits. Some management is not so great there needs to be a wipe out in supervisors and bring in people who are professional.
bad,"A temp manager was brought in to amend the store after loosing our last manager. He was cruel man, who used his position to bully me and my coworkers into submission. Our district manager clearly showed they were on the samr side, so I felt as though I could not reach out for help within the company."
bad,"While the manager was nice at my Dollar General, there was a strong disconnect between the employer and the employees. There was also very little in the way of team building and cooperation. Many employees did not feel they were valued or compensated for all that they do. Hours were cut very often, and it left us understaffed."
bad,"Productive, but not fun; isolated most times which is the hardest part about this job. The only thing I remember to had learned was how to locate items."
bad,I found at Dollar General that if you are fresh out of High School looking for a first job? Sure. Just don't expect to be compensated for hard work. It's clearly not a career. Customers are nice if you are.
bad,"The opportunity to move up is easy and fast. The turn over rate is horrible because the company don't properly train their managers on what their job duties are. How to speak to their employees. The store I worked at the D.M, STORE MANAGER, NOW ASSISTANT MANAGER, M.O.D, and some hired Cashiers was ALL friends outside of work."
bad,Not enough hours the job didn’t have enough hours for all of its employees. Management was ok they did what they could to try and provide more hours but it wasn’t up to them.
bad,"Working at Dollar General seems like a madhouse. I have not worked here for that long, but I can tell that management of the store is lacking in organization with low-quality technology and lazy employees. It may not be the fault of managers but I constantly get called in on days I'm not planning to work to make up for other employees who don't show up or call in saying they can't. I was thrown right into the job with little training and instead learned how to do things while I was on the job instead of being taught beforehand. Many times I was stuck in a situation at the register with a long line and someone needing help while the manager was not nearby to help. Many things I figured out how to do on my own, other things I was criticized for not knowing how or what to do even though I was never taught; ex. dropping money, taking tags off clothes, where the trash goes, where backstock goes, etc."
bad,I liked the job when I first got hired on. As time went on the job just got stressful. The manager had a attitude basically everyday and just too much going on in a business like that. I hate to say but I was just working there just to keep a pay check but eventually I started getting little to no hours and no pay checks at all.
bad,"I personally did not like the job, due to the fact that the manager left me alone since day 1 not knowing anything. I was left to figure things out on my own"
bad,I would recommend this job out of high school but I wouldn't relie on this job for a career it can be a fast job for stocking and ringing people out the door.
bad,"District manager very inconsistent in policies. Fits the rules to suit his personal choices. A typical work week consists of 60+ hours with very little payroll to work with. Therefore, salaried positions are left to burden the majority of the roles"
bad,"Not interested in employee safety,  payroll not sufficient to have at least two employees working at all times, even after armed robberies employees are often scheduled to work alone for hours."
bad,would of been a better experience if i had a different manager. the job  was easy but would get hard at times if you had stock then running back to the register. almost my manager was a rude person and showed favoritism.
bad,"Where to even begin! I have been with the company for almost two months and thus by far is the worst things I've seen ever in a place of business. The aisles are constantly stocked with stock that needs put away, the customers even complain of the disorldy look of the store. There is a lack of staff, making it harder on us that are employees there. Unorganized and a manager with very little proper training. Its Ames's waiting to be p"
bad,"The pay would have been alright but, it was salary and they required you to work a 6 day work week.  You were not paid any extra even though we were working 60-70hrs a week.  I was on a vacation and had to come back early because an employee was injured and the company wouldn’t help cover the store.  As a store manager you pretty much were a cashier because of their lack of hours to schedule employees you were forced to work at the store by yourself a lot of the time."
bad,"Looking for income it's a place to work.. looking to pay bills with paycheck wouldn't recommend. A good place to work if early adult or retired. Or even if you need to pay small balance bills (gas, mobile phone, car insurance"
bad,Store was always a mess.Management was not good at all. Customers were very nasty also.poor benefits. Would usually only let you work part time hours which results in a week paycheck.
bad,"I’ve worked for the company for three years, and three different locations. If you have a good manager the job is t so bad, but it is definitely not worth the pay to stay long term. There’s more to do than is humanly possible for the amount of hours/budget a store gets in a week. If you like a clean and organized work place, find something else. The customers are often rude and unruly but it does depend of the area"
bad,It is what you make it. If you got a good staff it makes your job easier. One bad apple can ruin the bunch. Job can be very stressful at times. They demand the impossible 90% of the time. Not enough hours for a part time employee. If you have a family this will not be the job for you. Manager is expected to work 48 hours but end up working 60 to get the truck processed. 7 day work flow will work one week and not work the next. Pay is decent but could be better for all that is demanded. This is not the place for you if you are married it will take a toll on your relationship.
bad,"Dollar General doesn't care about their retail store employees. They view them as easily replaceable. Therefore, the pay is horrible (most start at minimum wage). Work hours are inconsistent. Management is poorly trained. No employee discount. The only positive is that they do have good benefits for full time employees."
bad,"As a store manager you must be willing to really dedicate all your time to your store, and you have to have a very strong staff. Inventory management sucks"
bad,"Would not recommend working here if you have children. You never know when you'll be done working everyday and they'll give you an occurrence point for having to stay home with a sick child. Something unavoidable.. you have to work every single holiday. No exceptions. The managers are snooty, rude and don't help with any questions. The pay is good, but other than that, nothing good to say."
bad,Not worth the time and personal investment in my opinion there is no help and no reward for doing good so I suggest looking at the whole picture before you apply
bad,It's an alright job for somebody that wants to wait move up in their position but there isn't much to it. As long as you know how to handle your daily dose of attitudes from customers then you'll be alright.
bad,"There from day one, great place at first. The employees kept quitting so the hours got longer. Four ten hour shifts turned into five or six 12-14 hour shifts, mandatory overtime. When I said I couldn’t being a single mom, the director of the dc said “maybe this isn’t the place for you then”. Became an absolute nightmare going to work every day."
bad,would have been much better with better employees. I worked there doing stocking and being a cashier. I learned how to handle rude customers and time management. I enjoyed a few co workers but others were harder to work with
bad,"I think it is very high paced and hard to actually get time off when your working 7 days a week at minimum wage for part time. At the time there was only about 4 workers and you would be stocking while managing the registers. Management was not organized at all and did not understand how to manage a store properly,"
bad,"A store manager at DG must work 6 days a week.  It’s a job with way more tasks and projects than a handful of employees with bare minimum labor budgets can handle.  So the bulk of the workload falls on the salaried managers shoulders.  Even if your successful with the company as I was, it’s only done by working very long hours.  Great job for someone that has no life and has no desire to have one."
bad,"The hours are never set in stone at the warehouse in South Boston. Never know if you are working 8,10, or 12 hours. The only day you knew you were working with the correct hours were Mondays when you started work. The rest of the week were unknown"
bad,this Place sucks... from the overstock and never getting caught up to working alone or with one other person to stock an entire store. My DM asked me to work at a store 30+ miles from my house and home store and I didn’t get compensated for it.
bad,The management was not very good at all. My boss had a hard time communicating with his team and keeping the store up to code. Instead we had a back room filled with product and caused items to become expired and out of date.
bad,Other managers were very hostile towards customers and employees. Never wanted to work with single parents. They always wanted you to work 50+ hrs in a week without a day off.
bad,"It was very fast paced. I had to manage the whole store myself, stock shelves, checked customers in and out, clean everything, handle the drawers with little to no help at all."
bad,Very fast paced. Interesting work. Gotta know how to read plan o grams. District management is very demanding. Store manager and other store associates work with you as a team. Not given any opportunity to train in any part of store operations once store opened. New store so air conditioning was not working yet. Other than a very rude district manager job was ok.
bad,Not a bad job. But was promised a raise 4 different times and promised position advancement and never got any of them. I have talked to all the other associates part time and key holders and they all make more than myself by about $1. Manager takes advantage of me knowing my situation and knowing I need the money so he works me like a horse to get stuff done and it isn’t worth the money. Empty promises and empty deals to get him to look better in cooperates eyes.
bad,"The company does not give each store enough hours to properly staff, so everything is stocked, workload is done as needed, and so the customers are taken care of in a timely manner."
bad,"I can see why no one lasted at the location I worked at. "
bad,People need to put there recovery back after every shift and read labels.They need hard workers to preform daily tasks. No breaks for less than 7hours  workers
bad,"its stressful and difficult at times. not enough time, people, or pay. nobody communicates and everybody gossips. I definitely wouldn't recommend unless you want low pay and no benefits at part time hours."
bad,"Job its self is fairly simple straight forward how ever tend to be people playing favorites and if you have a bad supervisor will place there work on you and let you take fall for them not doing there job.  they also have trouble with employees showing up to work and keep a small employee number so if you have call offs most times store manager tend to have work double shifts to fill it I myself at lest 2 to 3 times a month worked 4Am till 9:30pm. any person above cashier will have several hours a day when they are only person in the store very difficult to get breaks ,lunch's and vacations."
bad,the hardest part of the job with this company is doing the truck with the lack of employees on schedule. I am not happy with this company that is why i am looking for another job.
bad,"The company itself is not great. Not good pay, no career advancement, and a stressful work environment. Only seen as a temporary job to me. Even the key holders above me were not making enough money to live off of."
bad,"You will be left alone, you will work whatever hours they demand. You will not ask for more or less. The job is demanding with long hours on your feet. There is heavy lifting and EVERYONE is required to stock. Your hard work is rewarded with more work. All of this I could have handled, but when the store was shot at and my store manager yelled at me for waking her up, when it happened, and the area manager wouldn't answer their phone, I was done."
bad,Dollar General is a good store with affordable prices and great deals to have. Working for Dollar General is the first step of having any work experience.
bad,Nothing is more annoying than having  a schedule that changes every week . District manager hires people that use to work with him at Kmart. Pay sucks even at 14/hr. The work is easy but they expect you to do too much with minimal help
bad,Dollar General is a good store. I worked there for a while. It was laid back and productive. I become shift leader in a fairly short amount of time. I enjoyed my duties and had a work and life balance.
bad,"This job is worthy of a high school student ages 15-18, only the minimum age they hire people is 18. They usually start you out barely above minimum wage, depending on your location and cost of living. The job is not worth the money, as your hard work will feel very unrewarding. As a Sales Associate, you will basically take care of the whole store by yourself."
bad,"Bad supervisors, there is no culture of working as a team, the company only cares about taking care of supervisors. Long shift and typical day at work."
bad,"Store manager allowed the assistant to be in a relationship with a key holder. Over worked, only $8 an hour to be a key. Expected too much in little length of time. I don’t recommend the store I worked for."
bad,Regardless of how qualified you are for a promotion or how hard you work it is very likely that you will be denied in place of someone less competent. I was eager and willing to put in the time and effort to become a shift manager when we were extremely low yet I was overlooked for someone who the manager previously worked with. He was known to not work very hard (which is his business and choice) and there were times that the manager asked me to make him stay on task and get things done. He is the one leading the shift not me! Why should I take extra responsibility for the manager's lack of control? If she wanted me to take responsibility for maintaining the store I was more than willing to but due to how Dollar General's district management gets to make the call on what should be the GM 's decision it results in an atmosphere of ineptitude.
bad,There’s no such thing as work life balance here!! You can never catch a break it’s modern day slavery from clock in until clock out! The higher you move up the more work! The pay is bs!
bad,"I was the assistant manager at the Dollar General and I was trained for one week and the store manager walked out and never came back. However, I was left to run the store with the little training that I had, so I took my skills from other management positions that I learned and it help me to get by. I reached out to the district manager for help and he told me that he would send me some help or come his self but never showed up or answered the phone when I would call."
bad,"I suggest that no one works for Dollar General especially as a store manager! They want you there at ALL TIMES!! No such thing as a work life balance in DG!! If you still want a life, DO NOT apply for DG!!!"
bad,"It saddens me to say that after all the time I gave to Dollar General. After all the energy and long long hours I put in with neglect to my personal life.  Dropping everything when I was needed. Helping without hesitation no matter what it was. It hurts to think that I can only feel bitter, sad, mad, used and so replaceable. They claim to be Customer 1st well what about Employee 1st or at least some after all don't think the store runs itself...yet. Only thing I will take from it to keep it moving and have something positive come from it is the experience. The knowledge of retail and merchandising. leadership skills that I can take with me to pursue better opportunities where I am appreciated valued and feel irreplaceable."
bad,"Dollar General is only good because of the customers. The management is horrible, they ask you to do 4 things at once while running register then get angry if you don’t have all 4 things done in a timely manner. It’s very stressful, but a good job if you have nothing else."
bad,Didn't like the work atmosphere. Workers were really lazy. That's pretty much it. The manager was really nice and did the job very well. Several workers were rude.
bad,Dollar general is a nice place to work with a close nit community feel but you will live at the store you run.  No work life balance at all. Pay is ok but for the hours you work should be more.
bad,didn't know what time you would get off. very hard work heavy lifting. very hot in the building. good benefits and use to have good HR managers. Was good about feeding everyone in the building around the holidays.
bad,"I would only recommend this job to teen-agers or young adults with no bills, no kids, and no responsibilities. The pay is not good enough to deal with the everyday drama that comes with this job."
bad,daily it was great and fast-paced. I feel that in the time of turmoil that the management team criticized more than anything. There is a such thing as constructive criticizing. Leadership is to build leaders.boss was rude
bad,"A typical Dollar General day if opening the store, reviewing tasks set by the manager. These tasks may include setting planograms for new or seasonal products, working the back stock from receiving room; along with numerous misc tasks. The evening shift entailed straighten and cleaning the store of clutter. The hardest part of working was the volume of tasks required to complete in a short time frame with little help. The most enjoyable part was the team I worked with."
bad,"Because of the low hiring standards, shifts very often required covering. Employees being fired for no shows or call in just as fast as they were being hired. Most of the time, You find yourself forced to do the job of several people in the same amount of time. Registers older than the building itself, many efficient features (like quantity, price check, ect) prohibited from use."
bad,They expect a lot for minimal money. No set schedules. Very minimal encouragement. Was let go from my position because I was pregnant and they considered me a liability.
bad,"Dollar general is a chill place to work at but the hours and pay aren't there, I would usually work 2 days of the week and only get $172 a week, so yeah if you're looking for hours and a better check look somewhere else. But one thing I will say is that this job is perfect for students."
bad,"This was by far, the worst work experience I have ever had. I only met one decent store manager (had 4 different store managers in less than 6 months) Customers treat you like the trash they constantly dumped in the parking lot. The best thing to do is smile, speed through the transaction, & tell the customer have a wonderful day."
bad,"i could not stand working here. management sucks and the pay is poor, i was not treated fairly, did other peoples work with no extra pay and did not get recognized for doing everything correctly."
bad,always on your feet always waiting on customers and making sure they are satisfied always making sure employees are working together to get work done and make sure employees are happy also something I always tried to do
bad,"At Dollar General, I stood at the cash register. I don't feel that I learned much at Dollar General. Management was never available and was difficult to locate in the store when needed. The culture was bland. The job was not hard, in fact, it was not challenging at all. I did not enjoy working at Dollar General."
bad,"Typical grocery store chain. Under staffed most of the time. Quick turnover most often because of low pay."
bad,It is an okay job for any student as a stepping stone into the workforce. It can be stressful at times but also a good way to learn how to work under pressure.
bad,One day on the job I had gotten a rude customer and called for my manager or high power source to assist the customer so I wouldn't argue  with  the customer and their attitude changed completely to decent.
bad,6 day work week is required and 12 to 15 hours days are needed to keep pace with  the workload.  The DM is the good to person for everything at the store level.
bad,"Everyone stay away .unless you like working 7 days a week with now time off and open to close."
bad,"I came into position already trained to be Lead sales/ management"
bad,"Opening and/or closing, doing deposits, recovering the store all shift, leading the team with tasks, doing my tasks, planograms, START everyday, checking in vendors, customer services, making sales, creating clearance events, working along side of the store manager, and loss prevention"
bad,"This particular Dollar General store was located away from other stores, and, as a result, it was usually quite busy and understaffed. Usually we only had one member of management and a lower level employee working the entire store at a time. This led to a lot of turnover and a stressful work environment despite the management doing a good job. Unfortunately, the corporate level has unrealistic expectations for this company and makes it hard to live up to those."
bad,"Personally, I wouldn't consider applying for a position with Dollar General because of my experience with this company;  If the DMs interacted more with staff in his stores instead of only the SM maybe the turnover rate will decrease."
bad,you are expected as a store manager for dollar general to be 'married' to the job. when there is a call off you as a manager need to be there to cover that shift regardless of hours you have already worked
bad,"I worked for Dollar General for over 1 year as an assistant manager. I followed to the best of my ability all of the tasks my store manager and my district manager assigned me. Many of those tasks contradict themselves. The area where I worked didn't allow for most of those tasks to be completed because of employee turnover and lost prevention tasks. I was unable to stock and recover the store most days because I was either doing someone else's job or I was preventing someone from stealing from the store. Bringing this conflict to the attention of the higher managers was useless because they still expected those tasks to be completed. You were still held accountable when you weren't given enough help to complete a task. Also, depending on the area, your store's recovery tasks may be the easiest part of your job or the hardest. I've worked in retail for 3 years prior to starting at DG and when my store manager left after my 7th month, I expected to at least begin training to become a store manager (at least at an Interim level until I learned what I needed). A lack of experience (possibly due to the impossible tasks I was unable to complete) was the reason given to me which lead to the hiring of an inexperienced store manager who never worked with the company. I ended up leaving because of the worsening conditions of the store. I was really happy and fortunate to work there in the beginning but over time I felt less appreciated and more used and ignored."
bad,"This job was a joke. The store manager can get away with anything and literally not even get a slap on the hand. As the assistant, I had no responsibility that resembled me being anything important and never got trained to advance. Always work 7-12 days in a row without recognition. Expectations are unrealistic with the time you are given and you aren't paid anything special."
bad,Was not a very good job. When I worked there I would work 40+ hours. Always getting called in on my days off or getting called in hours before my shift because management had to leave or was short handed all the time. Was so aggravating.
bad,If this company paid more for working 80 hours a week it then would be a pretty good job. But you only get paid 40 hours and you work double that.Just an bad company overall
bad,"The biggest con is having only one day off a week and required to work the rest. In addition to closing twice a week. You have no life or have the opportunity to see your family or friends. With their low-cost operations, store conditions are often messy and the employees are simply there to collect a paycheck. I've had to drop out to school to make ends meet with no real opportunity to continue to take classes."
bad,It was hard working at Dollar General they required a lot of physical work. My body was unable to handle that type of stress. I did my best. The pay was low. and no hours. I resigned
bad,It isn't the best place to work but it will help put money in you pocket the management wasn't great but the workers are kind and respectful I would possibly work at a different location
bad,"I like my job at dollar general market, what I didn't like is  the way Dm talk to me and the rest of my team , management over him was good,  just him, the ones he didn't like no longer work for the company"
bad,"nothing speaciail"
bad,The management wasn't very good to people. The customers were great but that was about it. The job wasn't hard though. Typical day was done with stocking.
bad,"Management needs to be updated. When other positions were available, they never gave everyone a chance, their favorite employees or friends got the other positions. HR did not help me keep my job while I was pregnant with my last child. Machines were always breaking down, totes were constant falling apart."
bad,Dollar general was my first 9-5 job coming out of high school and honestly it was terrible under the first manger I had note I will not state his name cause even though he was horrible I’m not that kind of person to throw someone completely under a bus if you catch my drift. So honestly my biggest gripe with the manger there at the time was he made me work off clock and made me work unpaid for both those hours and any mandatory overtime he so choose to make me do that week. I was young and dumb and was unaware he was not allowed to do that. I only found out about it after I brought it up with my dad he told me that it was against the law so he told me to contact Human Resources and they did nothing actually even said I was in the wrong for calling on him. So I later ended up quitting and then they reached out to me later on asking me to come back this time under a different manger and he was amazing much better than the last one never once made me work off clock or any overtime. He even got me cross trained to be a key holder so I could close for him and upped my pay. He ended up getting promoted and went elsewhere but the final manger I had was just as good he finished my key holder training and we got along great honestly one of the best mangers I had to date in simple terms of friendliness.
bad,"It's not that DG is a bad place to work. It is a very stressful place especially for a store manager. We have a lot of stuff piled on   us and no where near the time to accomplish all the things they want done. The budget is very small so a good portion of the workload falls on the store manager and it's a lot to handle. The pay isn't bad but it could be better and it wouldn't hurt the company to give their managers a few perks like sick time. On average a store manager works 6 days a week somewhere between 10 and 12 hours a day. We definitely work more hours a week than we are paid for yet the company won't allow us sick time. If we get injured, sick, or have a child who is sick we often have to work regardless bc our budgeted hours won't allow our shifts to be covered. The only way possible is to use our vacation time which is something we earned to be able to enjoy and  should not have to use for something like that. Also the company pretty much took away any and all chances to bonus. Yes some of the stores like the one I run is considered a T5 store and is eligible for a shrink bonus but often it doesn't happen bc a lot of us are high shrink stores. Would it hurt the company to give their managers a Christmas bonus  for all of our hard work bc our job no matter what anyone says is the hardest in the company."
bad,There are not enough employees to handle the day to day workload. The very low pay makes it very difficult to find qualified candidates to fill open positions.
bad,It was great place to work because I love working in retail and the customers were amazing. The only problem was the management was terrible. Mostly the store manager.
bad,Did not like working short on staff very little pay huge trucks many no call no shows extra shifts have to go cover other stores instead. So much responsibility for so little pay.
bad,A constant rush of customers with only a single fellow employ to help who is only allowed to stop stocking shelves and help if there is a long line of customers. No training given other what you learned from working other stores. Nice management other store manager's insistence that i am not allowed to call in sick and that i HAVE to come work when requested. The hardest part of my job is the stress of having things you know you have to do nut can't because there is so few employees that i get stuck with only a few moments away from helping customers at the register to do them or even take a short rest other than a lunch and then being scheduled and asked to come in for nearly if not the entire week. The most enjoyable part is the friendliness of the customers and coworkers.
bad,Overall good company to work for.  Very easy process to follow.  Fast growing company with easy advancement opportunities.  Great culture and team work
bad,they do not give the store managers enough payroll dollars to run their stores. leaving the stores vulnerable to theft and robberies. a typical day for a store manager is to work 6-7 days a week 10 plus hours a day.
bad,It was stressful you had customers that were rude almost everyday. There were a few who make it nice but it was retail what do you expect. Couponers always thought they were right and loved to argue. Then there was pretty poor management from the higher ups. Starting at a minimum wage of 8.25 in not enough for all you have to do there. I would not recommend unless you want a taste of the true retail experience.
bad,Very stressful place to work. All the work is piled on a couple of people. Pay was low for all the work you had to do. Good people but not a good company.
bad,I needed to move on once I did not receive the payment I was promised as part time manager. I enjoyed working there in the beginning and then it became stressful and not worth the money and time I was investing in this company.
bad,"Opening store, getting drawers ready for registers, counting cash for deposit to be taken to the bank, ordering trucks for the store, stocking, and unloading trucks."
bad,I don't think I have ever worked in such a negative environment in my entire 40+ years of work history!  And upper management seems to support and encourage perpetuating that environment.
bad,"Come in count my drawer, run the register, wait on customers,put out merchandise. I learned how to merchandise ,and keep the shrink down. I mostly enjoy my Customer."
bad,"Good first time job. Excellent opportunity to gain and develope customer service skills as well as social skills. Very low pay will varied hours, and they likelihood of multiple shifts in a single week."
bad,If you have a good team it will be a great place to work but at the store I worked at there was a lot of drama and no help from upper level management when the store fell behind or with employee disagreements.
bad,The organization of the company was always different daily.  There was no set routes and I could end up with a route so far that i may not make it home because I would be out of driving time.  Often spent the night in the  truck.
bad,"i initially enjoyed working there, but the more you do the more they lay at your feet. Many got away with things that were not consistent with a competent worker and never handled. i got sick of it"
bad,Asks a lot from the employees but the pay isn’t worth it for the amount of work you’re asked to do. Great job if you’re in need of quick work or don’t have any responsibilities.
bad,Working here was very stressful and the management wasn't very solid. it was stressful because of how many people show up to work The work itself wasn't hard to do and if you ask for hours you will certainly get them. Keeping people is a big problem that this company has for sure as a result don't be expected stay off on your day off
bad,I liked working here until i asked to go on vacation to see my mother. I had gave a months notice. I worked in a small store. Finally 3 days before my vacation I told my manager my last day would be august 30th because i would be starting school back up. well she said she set my last day to be that Wednesday because my vacation wasn't approved. Nobody ever told me. Then i got unemployment paper work stating i was fired because i was a no call no show for 3 days?
bad,All employee's deal with stress in this job. Cashiers have to deal with the stress of seeing and responding to customers first as well as dealing with management. Managers have to deal with customers second most times and there is not a lot we can do but make the customer happy even if the customer is wrong on prices or such. The company them self makes it stressful by not listening to the employee's who work in the stores on a daily bases as to what needs to be fixed in stores.
bad,Was hired to help with current work to upgrade PC's do inventory and provide all levels of PC support. Job was advertised and Temp to Hire Opportunity.
bad,Good luck is all i can say with this company and other employees.  I got hierd on by the store manager she left in anout 2 weeks for knees surgery leaving me not fully train the other employees leads mad becuse they didn't get the job a assistant manager so I gets no respect from them which m makes it impossible for my job to tell them.things they need to do other assistant manager don't respect me either act as my boss I'm like we have thge same title she cuss call me out my name no place to work.at no one want to work in a hostel environment. Work load can't get done on time they TAKE the toppers away for extra inventory so now you have to.leave stuff in totes  never can get them to stop sending unnecessary products so always back stock waste of money where no where to put it to.much to say about this company
bad,"Customers were great for the most part, the only times I ever had issues with them is if they didn't read the sale sign correctly. Pay is average and only opportunity for advancement is to be a key holder, which lots of times requires you working in the store on your own with no cashier because management let's people call out whenever without consequences. With the right manager who actually cares about the store and their employees, this could be a great place to work but if not, then it's miserable."
bad,This business is not up to standard. Lacks a lot in what a true business should have. There aren't really any appreciation towards hard workers and they do not follow their own policies and procedures.
bad,"Everyday was the same , not enough people and way to much work to do for 3 people. Constant stress and unrealistic deadlines. Overall  didnt like job."
bad,"This job was okay. I really didn't care about it, because the employees were 2faced and I'm way too old for that. I had an okay time when I was there."
bad,"To much work put on one person. Leaving one person to run the store. Which that would require them to stock the shelves work the cash register, and answers calls all at the same time at providing great customer servcice"
bad,"When I first started working at this store, I thought I would have fun and make new friends with the people I worked with. I have learned that they don’t care about anyone but themselves, when you request something they make sure it fits around what they want then they will add you."
bad,The customers are what kept me at Dollar General then i ask to be put down to part time hours where I was a pt key holder and was still being scheduled 6 days a week not good when u have kids there understanding at times but management really don't care about there employees
bad,"A typical day working at dollar general includes working with costumers and taking care of the store. At the store I worked for, the new manager had just come in and the place was a mess. There was constantly more inventory being ordered with no place to store it. The manager seemed lost or would disappear to his office for hours. We were constantly short staffed but instead of giving the hours to the current employees to make up for missing associates, the manager covered all the time that he had no one for. "
bad,Overall decent place to work. Hard to make rate with the amount of people your working with at times. Depending on area great supervisors. Most enjoyable part is being trained in multiple job functions.
bad,"Majority of DG's managers are underpaid & this trickles throughout positions which leads to constant unfairness, carelessness, disorder, & dangerous atmospheres."
bad,ok place to work got along with fellow staff and my supervisor was good to work for.i enjoyed greeting custormer helping find goods making there shopping visit pleasant
bad,"My work day typically revolved around the cash register. While being a Customer Service Representative, the job requires you to be on your feet for most of the time. The hardest part of the job is one hundred percent the people that come in. Sometimes the people are super sweet, but then you have the people who want to ruin your day because their day was ruined."
bad,I don't know if it's every store but I know I hated working at mine. Had one good DM but he got fired. Managers at my particular store were hardly available and rarely in. Still not sure how my paychecks were so low pulling 40 - 60 hour weeks. Missed alot of time with my kids and my health started failing.
bad,You can't get anything done. Over staffed on certain shifts and not staffed when needed. If you woerk for any dollar general do not have any expectations
bad,"Dollar General was a mixed bag.  The manager and coworkers were pleasant to work with and the work was fast-paced and overall enjoyable.  However, the computer training system for employees was abysmal.  Nearly each training video I watched reiterated that employees are responsible for most of the theft Dollar General suffers.  Here's a tip: don't accuse your employees constantly of stealing from you.  The honest ones like me are just rubbed the wrong way.  Ah, yes, and they were constantly afraid of a lawsuit over overtime.  No breaks, no lunch, and don't you dare work a minute over your scheduled time no matter how many customers are in line.  Seriously?  I found corporate expectations and policy to be ridiculous at times."
bad,I worked here for 7 months and had to constantly remind the manager about days off. He never scheduled anyone for the hours they needed and would spring up new hours inconveniently.
bad,"Horrible pay, horrible benefits, horrible payroll budget, horrible staffing, horrible management across the board. This is just a terrible company to work for."
bad,"The company wasn't very organized or professinal, my store was behind but as far as my first manger she was good, unfortunately because of the random mangers that kept getting hired things fell apart and nothing was getting done. Sales Associates like me had to do jobs that we weren't supposed because the new mangers didn't know what they were doing. I don't know if its the whole company, I don't think every Dollar General is like this but I wouldn't personally work there again."
bad,Would I go back I don't  think  so for a lot of different  reasons  the people  was bad there to work with I couldn't take my manger I don't know what  else to say about  that job
bad,"Very boring and slow, angry customers sometimes, hours were pour because we were only given so many hours.  I loved my boss because he was super nice and was very flexible with my hours."
bad,Corporate doesn't give stores enough to have all the people it needs and under pays the employees. Managers are stretched thin but they are properly trained.
bad,"I love the customers and merchandise however to large of workload without enough payroll. Long lines because you are left alone a lot, unable to take proper breaks, our manager was just evil and incompetent. They will mess with your time, lie and break promises."
bad,before my new dm came into the picture we had great management . i also got hurt on the job and have been treated badly. i built my store from scratch and have maintained for 4 years with no issues until the new dm came in .
bad,my time there wasnt nice but it was a job they expect your life to be solely about dollar general and can careless about you children. they want you to get back stolen products by play top flight
bad,"If you get sick, they will fire you. even if you try to get people to cover your shift. the people I worked with were nice, some of the customers were nice, but the corporate people suck."
bad,"Does not offer enough hours or hourly pay. As a full-time employee, you are only given 30 to 34 hours per week. Pay is not awful but with a lack of hours you can not make enough money to support yourself and they do not allow full-time employees to work additional jobs."
bad,"Great job for after school or moms wanting to work. Only people who make money are store managers and their under paid for the amount work required.  Its constantly throwing freight n always, always something to do.  They preach customer service but u dont have time to do noting but freight or planograms or clean.  Store hours they give their mgrs to run store on is ridiculous mgrs end up working half days by themself.    I work 32 hrs wkly n i bring home 230.00 weekly after taxes n insurance n u can rest assure i've earned every penny of that."
bad,"The company has a poor culture for individual growth, and treats store talent extremely badly.  They have no structure to develope in store talent, which leads to Store Managers who are not prepared for the position."
bad,I enjoyed working here bc I was able to meet and help people daily. I relocated and was not able to hold my position there. I meet alot of great people while working here.
bad,I don't like dollar General because of a certain manager that works there. She tells no one on what she was going to do when was recruiting new employees.
bad,Company is cheap want the store manager to fill in all gaps in scheduling them selves after not giving enough payroll to complete task and don’t understand when people quit on them due to no work life balance
bad,It was ok just to many hours  and no time at home with family. But overall it's an ok company to work for. I wouldn't recommend any one with kids to work there
bad,"I had fun working here for the first 3 years. But in the last year, things began to change drastically. It's no longer fun to work here. Too much is required of store managers with the limited resources corporate gives them."
bad,"Most customers enjoy shopping at Dollar General for almost anything because most of its products have lower prices than Walmart. However, working there is totally opposite of what customers experience. The sales associate has to quickly stock shelves in between customers with questions and/or ready to check out. Furthermore, the sales associate could be anywhere near the front of the store stocking or maintaining the visibility of products (recovery) while a customer or customers need you at the point of sale or cash register immediately. You're almost running back and forth between where you left off stocking shelves and assisting the customer. You have to ask and wait for a simple void to be authorized by a lead key holder or any manager on duty. Managers quickly become upset over any issues with customers that are not sure who to blame for their cards being denied. Many different customers don't always have enough money to pay for everything that they shopped for in DG. Sometimes we donate our own money to help them out to save the sale, but it's expensive. However, sometimes customers help pay for part or all of their purchase. The situation is stressful either way because any manager on duty becomes upset when we have too many customers waiting in line to check out. We are all moving merchandise (food or non-food) all of the time in between customers. At the end of the night shift, we only have 30 minutes to clean the entire store and run around putting up ""go backs"" or items returned or not purchased during business hours."
bad,"I supervised a team of 11 in call center environment. Great team, loved supervising and working with them."
bad,I got hired as a store associate. Some days I’d come into work for them to tell me to leave. Some weeks I would have 0 days down on the schedule for me to work.
bad,"I would have to work at the cashier all day. The hardest part would be to finish something in a certain time while still having to ring up the customers. I did not learn much because there was not much to learn, everything came pretty easy for me. I would stock, recover, and clean when I worked there."
bad,"Although I liked working there I knew it would do little justice for my morale. Working at dollar general was almost like using a vacuum cleaner with the bag missing-dust just keeps flying out. The store was unorganized and the work room was backed up from years of neglect by the store management, which in turn fell on the assistant manager who was always there in place when the manager could only make it to work a few days out the week and working few hours in those days."
bad,Expect to live in the store. They expect the salary manager to live in the store and provide little support. I was thrown into a understaffed store with little training and expected to perform without error. Could be a much better place to work if the proper support was in place. They do have a good mission statement of serving others and I do get satisfaction in doing so.
bad,It was a good work place. Co workers were very hard working. The manager was very friendly and understanding. The pay wasn't great for doing a lot of work.
bad,"The Manager is expected to do all the work. Hours are constantly reduce and the Manager has to pick them up because they are salary. On my one day off a week, I had 3 conference calls. If you enjoy not being home, this is the perfect job for you."
bad,"Low room for advancement. Upper management pretty much treats employees like thieves. There's a policy called presentation where you have to have someone look in your bags before you leave including your purse. Not allowed to have restricted days as manager, blackout times for vacation, low pay, expensive benefits, and massive amounts of favoritism. Highest employee turn around I've ever seen. My breaks were constantly interrupted and I've worked off the clock. Not enough time to complete tasks.  If they don't get done, there's no excuse and they write you up. Dress code was black everything even in the middle of summer without air conditioning, or it was at 80 degrees and we'd die in the store from heat."
bad,I did not like the Management there very much even though there was one assistant manager that I am friends with till this day. I was in school so I good scheduled evening shifts after going to school and asked for daytime shifts when I wasn't in school because I had a 2 year old(now 4 year old) with limited daycare hours but the manager would work with me with the hours. She scheduled the people she liked which was basically only management during the day hours and everyone else was stuck on evening shifts no matter what the availability was. I had to fight so I could get Sundays off for church. Plus the pay stinks.
bad,"The work is very stressful.  This is a high volume store, and I believe customer satisfaction and a friendly atmosphere are very important.  I enjoy interacting with customers and working with store associates.  There are never enough employee hours allowed to staff the store adequately to cover customer care and keep the store fully stocked and organized."
bad,"I liked the pay, but the management team didn't care about the employees. You don't make rate or have something going on in your life that makes you miss work... you're gone. Their turnover rate is very high."
bad,"I am glad I had the experience to be hired especially being in a position were I needed a job. The job itself is pretty simple, any person could pretty much do it. Lack of structure, the overall cleanliness of the store, and no opportunity made this place a quick job in between finding a better one."
bad,I love the fact that we were always busy made the time go by and I was working with great motivated people who had no problem working as a team. But as far as a company with growth potential there very much lacking. Its a great start of job for teenagers.
bad,It got to the point where I was constantly threatened and I was in fear of losing my job even though I worked 65-80 hours a week and the other stores were performing well below me. I had 2 days off the entire Summer and it was never enough.
bad,Was a great place to work till they put untrained and lazy managers in place plus all the hours got cut to where you couldn't man the store two people per shift anymore. No one did anything but complain.
bad,The overtime is great but you will work your buns off!! Productivity is outrageous. You don't make it you get wrote up or fired. Not a good experience for me out of all my jobs. The drive working at night very far.
bad,"They manager never work. They made me do her work and still had the nerve to get on me but I had my stuff to do. People were always stealing and when you tried to get a hold of district manager, they ignore my calls."
bad,"Cashiers, like myself, just stood around and waited around for customers. It was not a very challenging or driven job. I appreciate a job that involves work, and all I did was sweep a floor and scan and bag items."
bad,It was okay for a job but i would not recommend it for anyone looking for a career its more of a job for anyone who needs money although thats not what they will tell you.
bad,The customers made the day go by alot better.. Making them smile and making sure they had everything they came in the store for. Going above and beyond as an employee for the customers when the company didnt care about there employees
bad,Store Managers are salary and you work way to many hours and do not get paid for what uou have to do .  There are times you do not get days off and you pull many open to close shifts. You do not get ovet time.
bad,"Management was decent."
bad,"I've been scheduled one day a week for the past four weeks. At minimum wage, it's just not sustainable for my family. Will soon have to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"While this job was pretty easy and straightforward, the store I worked at had no positive atmosphere to speak of. Every day was a struggle to even want to work, and I felt as though I wasn't doing anything worthwhile here. I left after a month or two."
bad,"Job was ok, very easy work perfect for someone needing a part time job. Didn't get a lot of hours and had to work 5-6 days a week, day and night. Never had a consistant paycheck or schedule."
bad,"would not recommend at all, they over work the store managers to the MAX and way under value them. Expect everything to be perfect but yet do not provide the man hours to achieve perfection but Demand it anyway"
bad,"I enjoyed dollar general it helped me in alot of ways emotional and physical. The people I worked with were also great. Seeing my daily customers was the best part of my day helping and serving others is what I did best. I learned to set plainograms,set incaps,read my mags and so much more. I think dollar general is awesome but I just want to improve my success to something that pays a little more for the hard work that I do."
bad,Stressfull atmosphere. No work balance. Extremely low salary compensation for required assignments. Company prides itself on family and work balance. This is not the case.
bad,"This is an average retail job. The company will refused to provide full time hours in order to avoid having provide insurance. The store managers due the bare minimum, however the district manager is great and really has the store's/ employees best interests in mind."
bad,I would clock into my register and begin to start checking customers out. I would have to recover the first seven aisles on both the left and the right of me. In closing I had to sweep and mop the entire store.
bad,"it would be a great company to work for if they allowed you to hire staff, the expect managers to run the store,stock, customer service, etc all with very little staff. they set their managers up for failure and stand behind that."
bad,It's awful here the assistant can be standing rite there and she won't do anything but look at you. The lines are terrible. The assistant is out smoking in her car most times I'm there. I asked her to come in once cause the clerk was hung up on the till and couldn't do anything. So the line was all the way down the isle. Anyway there has got to be enough stuff for that cashier to do behind the till so she could watch for customers?
bad,I honestly only looked forward to going into work to be able to greet our returning customers. I was one of everyone's favorite cashiers and when i quit (due to racism) the business in that store had went down.
bad,never got any daysd off always got called in. pay wasn't enough for the amount of work I was putting in. job was overall completely  unfair. corporate was terrible too
bad,"About 50% of the customers were amazing people. Loved helping them out and talking with them. The other 50% were shoplifters that would literally walk out the door with baskets full of items and corporate seemed to never care about it. It was painful for us to watch people take advantage of our store, our family. We worked so hard to give our customers a great place to shop. The AC units in every store have been cheaply built. They used plywood instead of sheet metal and the cold air leaked into the atmosphere. The AC circulated the hot air into the store. Working manual labor in a store that is 85 degrees when your uniform consists of black pants and shirts, is not easy to do. The registers/pin pads always freeze up. They always wants items sitting outside but never want sales associates to be near their registers. So things get stolen often. Come time for inventory to be done, they blame shrink on employees and not shoplifters. Tax write offs is what this company seems to thrive on. We went without a manager for 3 months or longer. Never got any help cause they can never keep District Managers employed. They bring in new team members and they do not get trained properly. There is no organization in the company. They hire new managers and then put them in a store to fail cause they are overwhelmed at what sits in front of them. I am doing the Managers job and the Assistant Managers job for the Assistant Managers pay. I loved my job. I loved my team. I loved my store. But Corporate did not love us. It's the perfect job to get a little extra money. But advancement stops at Assistant"
bad,"I feel like corporate doesn't understand the dangers we're faced with everyday. To worry about if you're going to get shot, stabbed, or robbed today at work. When you're in an extremely rough area they should consider the safety of their employees more!"
bad,Dollar general was not a good company to work for. They have poor company values in regards to employees and their standards were uneven. They promise minimum weekly hours for management but do not produce. Bank deposits are made on employees time and not company time. Insurance is promised but not given when one qualifies. working conditions are not good because there is always to much product blocking isles.
bad,"Very busy place, and didn't get paid enough. It wasn't bad when I first started working here. But the roof in the store has holes and water leaked into the store when it rained. I honestly don't know if it ever got fixed."
bad,Work/life balance is an issue. The hours are very long and days off are hard to come by. Upper management is helpful and available. Compensation package is good for management.
bad,The hours weren't great and the pay was low however fellow employees and management was nice the worst part is the customer base they treat you so so bad
bad,"Plenty of room for advancement "
bad,Working at Dollar General drained all the enjoyment from my life. Even on days i didn't work I dreaded that i would have work later that week or weekend.
bad,"The management is the problem.  They will expect you to clock out when your shift is over and ask you to do things off the clock.  For example, I clocked out and I was told to clean the bathrooms or help stock."
bad,I worked as a cashier/stocker for Dollar General. I never worked more than 2 days a week and no more than 4-5. the overall experience was great. I loved helping my customers and being able to build a connection and trust with them. I just do not like that I was never worked.
bad,Constantly answering my personal phone due to inadequacy of hours and excessive call outs. Hours did not match requirements to run business during peak times.
bad,"This could have changed since I have left the job as it has been some time since then. However, I was overworked during my shifts. We were understaffed and I would be in charge of filling, organizing, cleaning, customer servicing the store when people needed help, greeting, and running the cash register. We did not have an overhead to call for management around the store so I would have to search for them, and they do not trust the associates enough to even allow them to delete something that was accidentally rung up twice - I had to find the manager for even the smallest things on the register in order to fix this which took up time and made customers wait longer than they should have waited. It was not a horrible job and did give me nicer hours with weekly pay, but it was so much to handle. They could have hired more people by now so it may not be as overwhelming."
bad,I loved the customers it was the management that sucked! After about a couple of months working their the toilet in their restroom broke and stayed that way for well over a month. Even after repeated requests to the corporation no one came to fix it! Thank goodness for the Subway next door! Guess what their solution was? A port a potty INSIDE the back stockroom which is where their so called breakroom was!!! #iquitafterthat!
bad,"very hard work , usually over worked , to much of a turn over with employees dont pay well , to much merchandise in the store , managers arent allowed to place orders they just send a truck every week and you never no what your gonna get or where your gonna put it"
bad,Dollar General is a nice starter job for anyone 18+. You really should have open availability before putting in your application. They don't do very well to work around your schedule unless you end up with a decent store manager.
bad,Very few got hired perment   out of twenty five  very few got was promise in starting WORKING THERE WAS TOO STRESS FOR ME!!! OTHERS may handle the pressure well .
bad,"Management...Literally the worst I've had the displeasure of working for."
bad,"All in all, this needs to provide better everything. A healthier work environment, higher pay, and more workers. The biggest problem was the fact that it would be one employee and one manager per shift. The distric manager is being cheap with compensation."
bad,"I enjoyed the work as a SM and there are great opportunities for advancement.  BUT, once you are on salary, you have no life besides work.  You may go weeks without a day off and you almost never get more than 1 day off a week.  The first 2 weeks my store was open, I worked 100 each week.  The hiring process is ridiculous and the pay is low, so getting decent employees is difficult. I once went 4 months without an ASM (and you know who picks up the slack)."
bad,The management here was nice t me when they were training me to become a manager. When I became a manager and was working just as hard as I was before I became a manager my job was threatened everyday by things the store and assistant manager were doing wrong.
bad,It is an okay job while you try to find a job somewhere else. The turnover rate of workers is high and workers are overworked and underpayed. The manager cared for the workers but the regional managers have never worked a day in their life inside the store and does not understand what goes on.
bad,I like my job but the hours from week to week are not consistent which is hard when your supporting a family. Also for what I am paid a lot is expected and generally there is not enough time to get all the tasks that need to be done on a weekly basis which makes the job stressful and in my opinion its easy work so it shouldn't be.
bad,"Expects you to work 3 types of positions with minimal training, and no chance of promotion, low pay, poor hours, ignorant management, and poor work environment."
bad,"I was still in school when working here, but the manager said work was priority and it did not matter if I graduated or not. That was the main reason i left. But they also were forcing themselves down the drain towards the end of my time there. Only four people working there. They do not keep your life in mind, they only care how much you can work and that you keep an eye on registers even though the other assignments you are assigned require you to be on the other side of the store. Terrible."
bad,"If you work here you need dot your I's and cross your t's. Corporate has had one too many ex-employess steal from them and now, everyone who works for them is a thief. Poor wprking conditions, over worked staff, and compensation that isn't even worth your time. You'd make more money begging for money on the streets."
bad,"great place to work, loved my job just could have use more pay. Also the air always breaks so the employees are forced to work in very hot temperatures."
bad,This job required stocking all day long and changing plan-o-grams.  I learned how to delegate job duties realizing that I could not complete all the tasks without the help of my staff.  The hardest part of this job was keeping employees for any length of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
bad,"I am currently enrolled in two college classes as well as high school. There are approximately seven workers and they are not flexible with schedules. When you try to call in you get attitude. I have completed all of my nightly tasks every night and am still told it is not enough (so they add more tasks to my plate). Overall, the workers ( expect two ) are not very nice or considering. You do get paid weekly, however. All in all, the place is not very clean, the management is not considerate of their workers, but your paychecks are decent."
bad,"My responsiblilities at Dollar General is to greet every customer that enters with a smile and speak. Ask if they may need help etc. I have to put out stock sometimes but mostly i run the register and do whatever voids , returns , or exchanges a cahsier may need. "
bad,"It changed from day to day, sometimes I would do the key holder job and other days I would work the register and the non key holder would do the key holder job, except for I would close out the store.. "
bad,"If you have ever worked in retail then this is the typical environment, but be prepared to be moved between stores without notice.  Even though it is a corporation each store has a different way of doing things."
bad,"They have incredible difficulty keeping managers; mainly because they put people in the position with no prior training, and do not train them afterwards.  They then get mad when things are not done to expectation, when the expectations change almost daily."
bad,"I enjoyed my job but at times it was very stressful, I spend more time at work Then I did with my family and friends due to always being under staffed"
bad,"I was about to be promoted to another job, according to the store manager. But instead, when i had to miss work one day to take my daughter to the hospital, my hours got cut to 13 hours a week. So, I started working at another store on my off days to make up the hours. My manager called the Area Manager and told him that the other store was ""stealing"" one of her workers and that she didn't know if she would need to call me in one day. The Area Manager stopped me from working there."
bad,"If you need A partime side Job this company is for you. But as far as a career I would not recommend it. As a Store manager the job can get overwhelming. Rude customers, unrealistic deadlines and expectations from hire ups, lack of store secruity and trying to keep up with theft. If you have a solid team and  the store you work is in a decent area then maybe its more manageable."
bad,"I definitely enjoyed my time there, but after my first manager was laid off we went through about 4 managers, the current manager is hiring too many workers therefore me being used to working 4 or 5 times a week, is barely getting 2 days now."
bad,"The job was good at first I started out a cashier. I thought my manager was nice and good at first. Then I watched her move a couple of people out the way so I could get moved up to Assistant Manager. I kept the position for almost a year, but then I noticed she was doing the same thing to me. I did not like my experience that I had with the dollar general that I worked at."
bad,"Dollar general was a unique experience. It have its good moments and bad. If you are dedicated enough, it broadened different job opportunities. It can be fun experience, if you like your co-workers."
bad,"Co workers are good but when more people are hired, your hours are dropped. Mine went to 15 hours a week so I left. no one can't live off that"
bad,"The store at which i worked was smaller, leading to better costumer relations, however this also lead to a lack of drive with the other associates leading to unclean work environments and extreme lack of man-power."
bad,I loved my job when I started and would have stayed there but personal reason is why I no longer work there. Loved my employees and loved teaching them new things. I was hired on as a cashier and after 2 weeks I was a key holder. After that a month later I was opening and closing the store all alone with no problems.
bad,"I worked in a district with five total stores. Our store was brand new and needed a lot of work. We did not have heat for two months during an extremely cold winter. Many of the workers were there one day and quit the next. The work was grueling, the customers were horrible, and our district manager did not listen to our needs at all. We had cameras going out left and right. We only had one working terminal. And trying to get tech support to actually assist was impossible. Overall it was a horrible experience and a very corrupt company."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of restocking shelves, working the register, assisting customers find merchandise, recovering the store, and closing the store."
bad,This was the most stressful job I've ever had! So much hard work.  Pay was ok but never any time off no time spent with my family. Some managers were cool.
bad,I recently quit working at a dollar general in Newton Falls ohio.    I worked at walmart for 10 years and never seen such horrible management ever.   So sad at how poorly that store is ran and the rules dollar general has.   The store manager has a not taped at the register that says we have to ask every customer for money for literacy or we will be wrote up.   What the heck.  We do all the work raising money for the charity and only person who gets anything is the manager.  That is not right at all.   And to have job threatened is crazy.   I was a department manager at walmart and we worked overtime if needed for inventory.  Not allowed to be off not one manager not store manager no one.   The store manager at this dollar general goes on vacation for inventory every year and makes all that work fall onto us turn keys.  We are not allowed to leave on our lunches which is our time.   We can not be rung out by a regular cashier so on several occasions when just me and a cashier till the next turn key comes in i cant buy food for lunch or a drink.  So i go the whole day with nothing if i forget my stuff.   I was told i am not to miss one single day in December by my manager unless i have a death in the family.  Seriously you can ask me and tell me we are so busy and need all hands on deck for the month but to be told im not allowed to miss work is craziness.  Our cashiers if they work 5 hours they get no break and cannot have a drink.   I dont understand why they can not even have a bottle of water to drink.  When your running register and in between customers your putting away
bad,I like the job when I first started and all starting down when I became a key holder and I wish I haven't and I want taugh all the rights things in the work and it turn out bad
bad,"There is restructuring of the company happening, from the top to the bottom. I would not apply or work there for  awhile. They are finding any reason to fire employees."
bad,"I gave 100% everyday at work im a hard worker, i made sure to give all the customers the best service that they could possibly ask for. Doller general had no room for advancement."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting new people.Everday I met new people and just seeing them every day made my job worth it I felt good helping people get what they are looking for.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General and working with my co-workers, they were some of the best. However, my rating is not based on the store I worked but due to the upper management. I had only been working there a short time and due to the upper management assigning our manager to other stores and helping them we were left to cover everything without the proper knowledge to due it all. I ended up having to work at another store for a few nights and the deposit came up $100 short, it was not stolen, hey looked everywhere, viewed cameras, etc., and they could not even find out what happened to this money. I was the one to be honest and tell them about it, and yet was let go because of it due to it being from my till. Never been wrote up, done everything they asked of me, showed up early to work, and stayed later if needed, even worked doubles...this showed me they care more about making a dollar than the integrity and hard work of their employers."
bad,Dollar General is a nice place to work as long as you are full time or still in school/have a second job. The amount of work required does NOT match the pay. There are never enough hours to go around so i was lucky to get 25 a week.
bad,overall an ok place to work has its ups and downs pay is good for the job and area work isnt to hard management is the biggest part to this jobs failure there is no motivation coming from them everytime i see a part of management i feel like  im a monkey who can be easily replaced whenever they want if they put in half the effort they expect from regular employees id give this job 5 stars across the board
bad,I was working at Walmart when I got the call for a part time sales associate with Dollar General. I thought I could work nights at walmart and days at Dollar General I was wrong. I had to decide if i wanted to give up Walmart where I was making 9.50 per hour and 30-35 hrs a week. But I was also in college and needing to do an internship to earn my associates degree. I informed the Manager at Dollar General of my hours and also I didnt want to work the weekends I had my daughters. She informed me I would be getting 15-20 hours a week and my pay was 8.10 per hour. and she would work with my internship schedule and the schedule with my daughters. THis was a lie since I've worked here in the beginning I was getting 20-28 hrs a week and the last three months I have only been getting 8 to 14 hours a week. Also I cant look for another part time job because all the places around me I would be a cashier and you cant be a cashier with two different stores.
bad,"upper management set unrealistic goals for the stores with the hours they provided for labor."
bad,This job does not allow you to spend any quality time with your family unless you're on vacation. There's plenty of work but never enough payroll to get it all done.
bad,"What I would do is stock shelves and work on the cash register. Mostly what I had learned was how to deal with difficult customers, and some of the other co-workers were not always the easiest to work with. The hardest part was no having enough employees and having long lines and sometimes no one to help so you would get angry customers and it was extremely unorganized. But I can say that the one thing I learned is how to handle things in difficult situations."
bad,We had a rate to make and it was hard to make rate because of the way the computer system handed out work to associates.  A lot of the people were rude to work with.
bad,"the most enjoyable part of working for dollar general was the hours, as usually opened the store at 8, and closed at 10 a shift usually ran from like a 8 to 4 or a 4 to 10"
bad,no training at all. no where near enough labor hours to run the store properly. this company doesn't care about it's employees at all or it's customers either for that matter.
bad,Management disconnected. Work alone more often then not. Meets new people and connect to frequent shoppers. Employees must sock the store watch for shoplifters and checkout customers at the same time.
bad,"not safe the store gets robbed monthly and the company does nothing to make you feel safe."
bad,"Some of the DMs. our thankless of the job that you do, you do everything asked and get little or no response, I am a successful manager and have improved each location's sales, customer service and shrink"
bad,"The job it self was pretty good. I enjoyed the people i worked with, but the management wasn't that great. Working at Dollar General there really isn't a hard part besides dealing with rude people. The most enjoyable part was working with awesome people."
bad,There is so much work that you will never have any free time. You also will never finish. There is a reason that you have never been inside a Dollar General that did not have boxes all over the floor. You will never get all the boxes on the truck out before the next truck comes in.
bad,"Not a horrible place to work, customers keep things interesting. But constantly overworked and under staffed. Always trying to keep up with daily tasks on top of making sure whole store is clean and running register while being the only one there. The hardest part of the job would be trying to get everything done on time, trying to move and tear down old planograms in the back of the store while checking in vendors and running registers and watching and assisting customers."
bad,I liked the jobs and some of the other employees. They did not train me properly and therefore when it came to stocking products I was slow.
bad,"The job was very easy to work, but the management is the huge problem, most of the things they do is breaking rules, talking through bluetooth while working so the cameras cant see them violating rules, worse yet, the one I worked for had a rule that if a manager gets a write up, the workers under them do aswell, and the other way around."
bad,typical day started with reviewing constant price changes. I learned to manage my time and hours mostly working alone with low labor always an issue. The hardest part was always trying to complete tasks in a reasonable time with no help.
bad,"Regular work schedule was open and close the store, look over associates. Management sucked. there were no working cameras"
bad,"You barley get hours and you can't get sick or you lose your job. Hostile people and rude managers. Only, a few good ones. One, coworker barley helps you. Your pretty much alone. The place gets robbed often."
bad,Used to be a fun place to work until bad management arrived. Childish adults to work with. Will cut your hours for no reason. Lies to district manager because they don't like you and wants you fired. HORRIBLE MANAGER and ASSISTANT MANAGER. Not all stores are like this one.
bad,They give you a max of 25 hours a week. You go in every day for 4 hours and than go home but they pay you minimum wage. Management is great the hours and pay suck.
bad,ok place to work if your a kiss butt you can make it a long way did love the sales experience had great times interacting with the customers.
bad,"Learn how to satisfy customers under extreme pressures"
bad,"A typical day at work for me is always the same, cashier, stock, recovery and helping customers. I've learned some things like working a register, making sure everything goes where it belongs. Management is hard, sometimes things are difficult. my co-workers are nice and genuine I guess, I can't comment much on that. Hardest part of my job would have to be closing, it gets annoying at times but most of all, I like to see people happy when they leave the store"
bad,This is a good company in general. The people are not so good. The management here leaves a lot to be desired. They do not own up to their own mistakes. They have a bad habit of replacing people too quickly.
bad,"The management wants you to be pull quota, but doesn't show you how. You do work a lot of overtime. I enjoyed my co-workers."
bad,"For the amount of money this corporation brings in, the employees suffer. the medical benefits are not very good, the pay is not really enough to live on. Each store is only allowed to schedule employees for a specific amount of total hours per week. This is not enough to ensure to store is properly staffed at all times, especially with the tasks the expect you to complete. The company claims to treat you like family but they really don't, you are just a person to run a register and put product on a shelf."
bad,"Working there as long as I did, in the position I was in, doing as much as I did, it's sad to say that McDonald's cashiers made more than managers in this not so good company!!! I would never recommend anyone to work there!"
bad,This was one of the few jobs I can say I truly didn't enjoy. I was always treated as if I was insignificant and could be replaced easily. Of course I kept my mouth and respected my managers at all time until my hours were cut to 5 hours a week.
bad,"Always ran the front end of the store alone the manager was either working in the back room or on a break when needed. Enjoyed helping customers and being able to assist them. Hours were hard to come by, and there were always new employees because of the lack of hours. Great for learning retail skills like cash management, customer service, stocking and facing shelves."
bad,The work environment is extremely adversarial . Double standard often applies. Don't  count on your Employee handbook. You can count on the management to do regardless of rules and promises
bad,"Dollar General  was a great company to work for, the only negative thing that I didn't like is,  not knowing when I had to work,  it was a second Job, the ex store manager didn't know how to have the time people  worked, then we had new store managers, other then that, I  enjoyed working there."
bad,Dollar General is profit driven not compassionate towards employees.  Does not provide adequate staffing to allow Managers to run the stores properly.
bad,It was a job I showed up and was able to pay the bills with it other than that I would only recommend that you work there if you have no life ambition or just want a part time no brainer job.
bad,"A typical day is me coming in counting my register checking out customers ,stocking merchandise ,putting up end caps, and marking down food that are about to expire. I learned to be more professional in a working environment and how to control what I can control like my emotions and my working habits. management was ok but we had our difference's I never express my concerns with them because I was not favored employee over other coworkers. my co workers for the most part was ok I didn't have a problem with them we joked and made work fun. the hardest part of my job is that I have to run around the store to find management to solve a problem or need help with a customers. the most enjoyable part was helping my customers putting a smile on there face made my job much better.     in summary it was a way to get by but after two years it wasn't easy to get advancement to a management position and hard to make ends meat in this tough economy. I felt I gave all I could to the company and got nothing back in return for my hard work."
bad,"Dollar General left no room to move up and no promise to do so, but management and upper management tried to work with you so you felt fulfilled in your job."
bad,Management is terrible. Little to no lunch when working with assistant manager because she cannot be left alone with the money at the store. Poor set up overall. Store manager expects you to work full time when you're only a part time employee and going to school.
bad,I loved meeting new customers.I had an edlery lady that can in the store she was unable to do her shopping so I walked around the store and asst her with her shopping.I had an cashier to verbally and physcially assult me. I remind calm and took the assult. Management is poor
bad,"As a sales associate or lead this is an ok min wage job. As an assistant its a lot of work for a small pay. As a store manager it can become a nightmare. This company is based on a business model that is so fragile that one or two call offs in a week can send the store spiraling downward. The work load is high and the low staffing and low payroll budget make it hard for the salaried store managers. They micro manage everything in an attempt to make their low budget business model work. As a former store manager I ended up working 60 to 70 hours a week on a 48 hour salary just to keep my head above the water. You are expected to ride your min wage part time employees to get maximum productivity out of them which in turn promotes high turnover and that results in a constant flow of untrained employees in which you are not given any extra payroll to train. In a perfect DG world where all your employees are well trained with open availability and no one ever calls off, the store manager can work a 50 hour work week and have a nice store. Let me assure you with the pay and the hours you will NEVER have a perfect DG world. Who wants to work their butt off for 15 to 20 hours a week, be expected to be available openly and take home $80? Good luck. They took a job I loved and made it into something I couldn't wait to get away from."
bad,"The employees are completely responsible for running all aspects of the store. If the cashier gets a long line and is swamped, they very well might be stuck for it. The management system is very well handled, unlike the employee assignments. you have to really like the people you work with to make this worth while."
bad,"When I first started at Dollar General it wasn't too bad, I was actually excited to go to work and earn an honest days work. After about 5-6 months that started to change. Management would never take notice of employees going ""above and beyond"" and the store's goals for long-term success were very unclear. After that management got let go and a new management team was brought it things got even worse. The new management barely knew how to run the store and the blame would all fall down on the hard-working sales associates. I don't mind at all working with a healthy striving crew of individuals but when the captain can't maintain a healthy, productive ship things get difficult very fast."
bad,Remodeling the store was tough work and I was not very well paid.
bad,The work is easy and not challenging at all. Pay is low and hours were short. I really can't say it is a bad job it just didn't work for me.
bad,"Very busy store"
bad,I had a great time working here. I had  to leave due to relocated
bad,. The hours given a store are so small you are forced to work 60 work weeks just to get things done. Then they want more.
bad,When I 1st started @ DG I enjoyed it. But the company was in the middle of a restructuring & the management they brought in made the job unbearable. They laid off most of the people at my store when they brought in new staff.
bad,"Beginning at Dollar General, it was a wonderful job. As time went on, the management showed their double standards. If you were a smoker, you were allowed as many smoke breaks as you want. If you were a non smoker, you only got 1 fifteen minute break. The customers were usually nice, so that was enjoyable. Overall, Dollar General is just your typical cashier job."
bad,"Like most retailers, Dollar General has its share of benefits, but they are outweighed by the allure of the almighty dollar.  I was hired in at a good pay rate for retail, then sent through what I consider to be the worst Assistant Manager training ever.  It included 99% computer based learning that was not really relative to everyday activities and only 20 minutes working a cash register prior to being handed the keys to a store."
bad,a typical day at work was easy going. i learned many computer and printer skills. management was understanding and amazing. my co-workers were very generous and nice. the hardest part of the job was leaving to go home. the most enjoyable part of the job was having the honor to work there everyday and assisting students and faculty with any problems.
bad,"Its a place with great benefits but, a little costly. The work is plenty, timely as for your work assignment. Management is poor and the moral for the employees low."
bad,The pace of a typical work day was a company trying to get every drop of work they get out of a salary manager.  Upper management support for the stores did not exist.  The amount of work that a crew could produce when they were engaged and wanted to succeed and make the manager proud of their accomplishments
bad,I liked to stock early every morning sometime it was hard putting out 1200 crates a day in only four hours but I did it.
bad,Typical day here for me was opening and sometimes closing the store. I would handle the paperwork as well as the customers purchasing items. Mostly assisted in helping the other employees to get there tasks done in the proper amount of time granted. Hardest part of our day was trying to get multiple tasks done in the same week on top of new tasks being sent to our store. This company is very unorganized.
bad,"Dollar General is an excellent alternative for shoppers who do not want to maneuver larger retailers. Working there allows you the opportunity to meet and help a wide variety of customers which can be very enjoyable. Because Dollar General is a large chain there management of the stores and employees is much like any other major company and sometimes the rules and policies do not seem logical. I would not likely go back to work for this company because store and district managers, during my time there, do not follow the rules and guidelines for themselves but demand that all lower level employees strictly follow them or face termination."
bad,"Fast pace, Cashiering, Computers, Sweeping and Paperwork. I learned that its a lot of responsibility and pressure. Management is poor not very good. Co workers are very different and fast pace. The hardest part of this job is to maintain the store with unprofessional management. Enjoyable part of the job is customer service and the customers."
bad,"A typical day at work included opening and closing store, customer service, running cash register, checking in vendors, and stocking. My manager showed favoritism, shared information that should have been kept to herself, i.e. telling everyone when someone got written up. My co-worker were lazy and only did the minimum to get away with it. The hardest part of the job was to stabilize some form of constant flow and organization to help better customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was forming relationships with the local customers."
bad,"ring up orders, collect money, give change, I learned that putting things up in the food area was not easy, management they were ok not to friendly, co-worker there was only two people running that store at night, hardest part closing up for the night, enjoyable not a whole lot"
bad,"Had a great immediate management staff to work with; however, Dollar General will try to squeeze they can, with little pay as possible. Even though salary was far away from minimum wage, but not enough for the type of work.  Constant fights with immediate supervisory and the distribution center general management. Dollar General does take care of their employee's though.  Constantly fed us, however the logistics of how the distribution center is run, needs to be revised badly."
bad,"Good company, not great wages. Alot of unloading and heavy work. unpaid holidays."
bad,"I love doing the work I do. The management however...2 of 3 people over me are rude and have bad attitudes. They are awesome one minute and the next allow stress to flip them into a bad attitude. I am not against correction, but not in a rude or sarcastic manner. The work involves mostly running cashier. In your down time between customers you do routine recovery...making sure the shelves are cleaned up, the product is faced, and all products are in the right place. There is also stocking on fridays and saturdays. The most enjoyable part is working with people. And the hardest part is dealing with rude management."
bad,"A day consisted of keeping the store operating in and effective manner for the the employees, the company, and most important the customers."
bad,"The stores are told by the corporate office what hours they can delegate to its employees, so you may get only 30 hours (or less), even though you expected to get 40 hours, which is generally the rule. If you need the money, you're sometimes able to get more work at another Dollar General, if they need the help."
bad,"Enjoyed helping families because I love to help, but hated people in charge; no heart for this line of work unless press was involved."
bad,it was not a safe place to work. and they did not conduct professional
bad,Travel to several store on a weekly basis. Hiring skilled workers alone was a challenge. Hardest part was controlling shrink due to several contributing factors.
bad,"I loved interacting with my regular customers. An average day I maintained the upkeep of the store,basic cashier duties supervised the shift managed inventory and stock. Performed daily financial reports prepared deposits."
bad,I was a assistant manager and learned to work with customers and set boundaries for my employees.
bad,"I learned a great deal about systems, product flow, and interacting departments from the position of supervisor I, that can be used in multiple settings within the distribution industry. Technical, production, office, and management skills were obtained in this position that would make it possible to work within the industry again."
bad,"The work is fairly simple, run the register, recover the store, work truck. But to advance even to a key holder is not easy. In January of this year my store had a change in management. I found out a month later one of her first duties given to her by the district manager was to fire me. I've never met this individual so that came as a complete surprise, especially since I didn't even have a verbal, much less written warning in my file. Because of the DM I have no chance even to become a part time keyholder, much less becoming a part of management."
bad,"total management of retail store stock banking orders,schudling of associates,inventory"
bad,"My experiences at Dollar Generals vary by where I've worked. I've worked at 4 different stores through transferring for breaks at College when I came home. I read review of the ten worst retail stores to work at and Dollar General was number two and it deserves to be there. I'm only part time so I don't get healthcare benefits or anything but I've heard that they take a lot out of paychecks for 401K and any health plans. The pay is minimum wage for regular associates and managerial/key positions arent much higher. One thing I didn't like is I had worked there for a year and a half and had got a .25 cent raise, I left the company for an internship for three months and when I came back they couldn't honor the raise they had given me for being there over a year. The concepts they have at corporate to reduce shoplifting are wastes of money, instead of investing in more security cameras, they decided to buy little plastic guards that hang over the ""most stolen"" items that makes noise when you open them to get the items. I don't agree with how they send out stock to the stores in bent up metal rolltainers, then they stock them where things such as perishables and easily damageable boxes/items are placed on the bottom and place heavy things such as bleach or laundry detergent on top."
bad,I would work there if no other choice...still am...yh. The corrent store is behind about 4 full truck loads and managment is way behind.
bad,"A typical day at work involved running the cash register, helping the customers, bringing the buggies from outside in, stocking and if you worked at night you had to mop the floors. I learned tolerance. The customers can make you want to pull your hair out and then you had customers that are as sweet as pie and that can make your day. Management was okay, depending on what manager you have. I loved ALL my co-workers. I do not think I could have survived with out them. The hardest part of the job is everything. Having to deal with un nice customers is really hard. You have to have patience. Also, they want you to try to stock so much, run the register and help customers. If you were not at the register right when the customer walked up they would just about throw a fit, although you were stocking (part of your job). The most enjoyable part was with the people I worked with. There were very few customers that I enjoyed checking out at the register. Also a big contribution to the rude customers I believe is the environment and location. You never really get breaks. They expect unrealistic jobs from the managers and third keys."
bad,Overall job conditions were average but they demanded too much of the reliable associates.
bad,"I mainly worked the evening shift, I was the closing manager which means I worked when it was the slowest. I was responsible for nightly deposits and making sure the store was ready for opening in the morning, Setting all sales ads and special promotions."
bad,Work with a crew that is somewhat about themselves and can not communicate well. Not enough pay for the job at all. Worked in dangerous environment.
bad,Lots of store locations and good opportunity to meet other associates and advance forward up in the company. Usually busy days keeping store stocked and clean and preventing theft while driving up sales.
bad,I am a store manager and my store was changed around and when they changed it around they did not move the cameras as well. I have ask upper management and they will not move the cameras. Dollar general cuts hours like you cut grass in the summer time. With the lack of hours you have to depend on your cameras at times and with the lack of cameras your at a lost. I have a BIG over turn because of the lack of hours and the budget they give you to pay your employees. The hardest part of the job is finding people that will work for little money and 10-15 hours a week. Management is the same way with PAY ... FYI .. My co workers are awesome they try there best !! The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers. There is never a dual moment.
bad,"There was a leak in the stockroom so bad that the entire stockroom, office and restroom areas were covered with water every time it rained. They had our store manager so stretched out between stores that he was barely at the store."
bad,"I typical day at work consists on running the cash register, unloading totes and stocking shelves, proving good customer service, and answering the phone. I have work with many good co-workers but unfortunatly the management is not run very well. The hardest part of the job is trying to manage the cash register, put away all the stock and face the shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"it was a job-I would work 6&7hours sometime 8 without a break,not so much to say!"
bad,the store i worked it was slow and repetitive but when things picked ut it would end up being interesting and exciting.
bad,"A typical day at dollar general, would be sometimes enjoyable sometimes not so enjoyable of course that's with anything in life. But a typical day on the job is well everyday of the job moving rolltainers taking them, down, stocking the shelves and running cash register if needed. I have learned that people have alot of different out looks on life just by the people that come in the store on a daily basis. Co-workers? Are great people they help you out alot with questions not just things concerning the store but just life it self. I would probably say the hardest part of my job would probably be finding things you haven't seen before and standing on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part and delightful part of my job is meeting and seeing new faces also associating with people."
bad,"Very stressful job. Co-workers were never held accountable for their actions. They were talking on cell phones, doing no call no shows , coming late and not wearing uniforms or name tags and management would not follow through with procedure for all the write ups I did. Co-workers were very disrespectful it was like a playground. Management was too friendly with co-workers."
bad,"I loved working there at first, until I went a month without being payed. I tried to talk to my boss about it but she would just brush it off. Finally I called corperate. A week later a months worth of checks were deposited in my account but my boss confronted me and told me there had been no need to call corperate. Almost immediatley she was changing my schedule like crazy. She took the schedule home with her everyday so that I would have to call to find out if I work. On a few occasions I called in the morning to find out if I work that day. She would tell me no. The usual time for me to go in would role around and she would call me asking where i was and say that I was scheduled to work. The day I found out I was fired I went in to work thinking i was scheduled for that day and found out from my friend/co worker that I had been fired. When i called my boss to find out why, she wouldnt even give me a reason."
bad,Theres always work to do and most customers are regular visitors. I moved up to management in 3 months of working there. We worked as a team. And most days were great except for the occasionally unhappy customer. I loved meeting new people passing through on their way.
bad,An average day at Dollar General for me was working directly with my District Manager or other District Managers on special assignments or projects of urgency from store to store.
bad,This job is okay for a high school student. The management is not professional at all. My coworkers however are fun and exciting to work with.
bad,"Didnt have any problems with dollar general, bad pay thats it."
bad,"It was a job that many people wont do. The hours are long and the pay is not enough. Very cold in the winter, very hot in the summer."
bad,"We need help in stocking our shelfs,no help in the morning, opening store by yourself when two people needs to open in order to get shelves filled no one ever stay"
bad,Working for Dollar General is Very Time consuming an will take away from your home life. Store Managers work six days a week and are on call on their off days.
bad,"Just let the supervisor know u want to advance and they will train u, it's just really easy to get fired for no reason. They don't really value their employees.."
bad,"Poor management, company leaders do not care about the associates . Not enough employees,  not enough pay for the work load expected to be completed in a day to day."
bad,"Your home life is non existent, the work load is to much, and the expectations are too high for a low cost business. You will get yelled at be everyone,"
bad,"This job is a very simple one. However, employees are expected to do all things in the store such as running the register, putting out stock, recovering shelves, setting up sales ads, cleaning, etc. within short periods of time for minimum payment. Also in my experience, the store is very understaffed so you can expect to basically be ""on call"", never get too comfortable on a day off because the odds of being called in are high. Although it is a very simple job that earns a paycheck, so it is better than nothing. The management is good and some customers make it worth it."
bad,"upper management is over stressed"
bad,"upper level management are a joke. store level management are over worked, not thoroughly trained, and severely understaffed. Most sales associates are shown the register once then left to fend for themselves. the online hiring process has many issues and it's incredibly difficult and tedious to receive applications and for employees to login to the dg portal to fill out hiring packets. the stock room has freight from as far back as june 2018 that still hasnt gone out. as well as the sales floor is overflowing with more recent trucks that can no longer fit in the back."
bad,"I currently work at DG part-time as a sales associate (basically a cashier). The work is a bit dull, but not all that demanding. The pay is low. If you are looking for a part-time job to earn a bit of extra money it is not a bad place to work. I'm not sure what working at DG full time would be like."
bad,Each day was basically the same. I would come in and stock shelves and greet customers. The culture there was a bit bias simply because the manager at this particular Dollar General where I was employed is the mother-in-law to one of my former co-workers.
bad,Job placement at Dollar General is not about what you know or what your skills are it’s about who you are and who you know. Management could really use some improvement as well.
bad,"It's a Job. Rate of Pay for what they expect is Horrible. DG cares about Money, keeping it,not spending it. There is a Good reason why they Are Hiring all the time. Run a Million dollar store on a 1,900 a week payroll. That's why only one register is only opened,  took me 10 yrs to make 12.00 an HR. And was told by DM's I made too much. Room for advancing because people get fed up and leave."
bad,"People are back stabbing as employees and coworkers and if your new never worked retail before this isnt the job for you. There is no clear training guidelines. I wasnt told I was wrote up like 5 times in the 6 months I worked there, I worked my butt off and got paid very little I always checked in with the store manager my work was good. ALWAYS, be nice to customers no matter what."
bad,"I have worked at several Dollar-General convenience stores throughout Florida. A universal feeling of dread seems to permeate every store. Yet, that same feeling seems to infect all retail-jobs: it might be unfair to criticize the company for that issue alone. "
bad,I would putaway between 20 to 25 pallets a day. I learned how to do my job better and faster every day. Management does not treat every equally. The hardest part of my job was deal with coworkers that didn't like me because I worked hard & better than them
bad,"I started at Dollar General in April as a cashier/sales associate. Things were great for awhile, but we had a few people leave which made things a bit rocky. My manager and assistant manager took advantage of how close I lived to the store and would constantly call me in early so they could leave work as soon as I got there. The store manager is required to work 50 hours minimum as a salaries employee with the company but she doesn’t doesn’t do that. Dollar General needs to do better because at no point should a store only ever have one employee at a time especially in the neighborhood that the store is located."
bad,Dollar General isn't fair with situations. They just tell lies to everyone. And tell lies to cover themselves. They want to write people up for everything. It's not a good company to work at.
bad,When I started working for Dollar General I was  making $7.25 as a part time Cashier.  Since then I've moved up to becoming a full time Key Holder making 10.75. Working here hasn't always been easy. Having to deal with a different schedule every week and rude customers.  Changing of D.m.s and Managers . Even new coworkers on top of having to do alot work.
bad,"The dollar general that I worked at was often slow, and the only job I had other than manning the register was to 'pull forward' and make sure the shelves of a specific region of the store looked neat. Once that was done, I was expected to sit at my register and do nothing, or to once again pull forward, even if it didn't need done. I was not allowed to listen to music when mopping after the store closed, or to check my phone for texts when I had nothing else to do."
bad,I liked working for dollar General at first. Ready to try something new. They give okay benefits for full time employees. They could treat their employees better.
bad,"Dollar general distribution train there employees good , the pay was ok, a few of the supervisors were ok , but most were so stressed out that they took it out on the workers. Some supervisors had there pets that could get away with anything.  One good thing is they work with there employees when it comes to there families"
bad,"I worked at the dolled general market. The pay horrible 8.25 a hour , and they work you to death .they havee running back and forth from cashier to stocking . they want hire people and the store manager stink ( literally) his scent lingers around so if he not round trust me an customer will most definitely think it you. They do promote within the business but I feel o should've been gotna promotion since I'm always there monday -Friday. The store manager is fake he talk about all of his employees and tell there business"
bad,"i really enjoyed working for Dollar General. The company gave me many opportunities to perfect my costumer service skills. most times would be at store by oneself so became very good at multitasking and handling all types of problems or concerns with confidence. Good Company , the pay just does not match the responsibilities given"
bad,Dollar general really dont care about thier employees or coustmers . They only care about thier money unless something is going to affect them . The pay sucks also .
bad,"Not a place you want to stay forever by all means."
bad,"I have worked with the company for a couple of months now and all I ask for every single day is a schedule that is not changing every single day as well as 40 hours and two days off in a row; it is like pulling teeth, but worse because it never actually happens."
bad,Dollar General Expects store managers to do all(if not most) of the work and payroll hours are so low that most times the manager is alone for 5hrs...
bad,"DM who hired me was great, then we got a new one that wasn't."
bad,The new supervisor they hired in did not care about any of us. Never listened to the problems that we're going on. We worked 10 to 12 your shifts with no help. Never worked just 40 a week
bad,"There were two managers of the store that I worked at and I liked them both. Being from a smaller town, it was a fairly easy job to get. This store was also 5 minutes from my house, making the commute to work very easy."
bad,Cooperate really only cares about making money without really addressing certain store issues. The store managers get paid salary but work twice as hard they are expected to solve everything pertaining to the store even large issues that they have no control over & when they file a complaint or problem it takes MONTHS for something to be done. If you work here make sure to get paid hourly.
bad,"I enjoyed going to work"
bad,They set up their labor model as if everyone that works there is a seasoned employee that works at max speed. that is never the case-always turn over always new people that dont know where things are or how to do things. I was Salaried but by the time I put in 60+ hours a week b/c there was never enough help I made about minium wage. Cheap company!
bad,"If you want to work only 14 to 22 hours a week for just over minimum wage, it is worth it. Don't bother if you want full time hours as you won't get it. Home office won'y want to free up hours at some stores so some sales associates can survive without fear of loosing their place to live."
bad,"Its a rough gig. When I left, they were still paying starting cashiers 7.25 an hour. You are expected to do at least the job of 2 people and when you can't, you're told about yourself"
bad,Not good pay. Would be a alright company to work for if they would pay the employees better. There's a big turn over due to a lot of hard work but bot worth the pay. I was ASM and only made 10.60/hrs and did just as much as the Store manager did if bot more.
bad,"Dollar General is a very stressful place to work. Primarily because the workload is overwhelmingly outrages for the labor hours that are allowed. The pay is not worth the amount of work that is expected to be done. Also, there is no way to balance work and family when you work in a management position."
bad,"If you are a high school or college student with little or no experience, it is an easy place to start off. However, the pay is only around minimum wage."
bad,I knew the manager at the store I worked at..I got the hours I wanted with days off I wanted..the pay was terrible no benefits..had to find another job cuz it didn't pay bills
bad,I only worked for awhile but the want the cashier to work the front stock and front shelves while the customer waits up front for someone to help them which I do not think is right for 8.00 hr and making the customers wait is wrong Customers come first hire some to do stocking and front shelves
bad,"I chose to leave the company after incidents where the manager told me to service someone who had recently stolen on top of allowing an older gentlemen purchase a product he clearly and repeatedly ""inteded to use dangerously"". Morality plays into my work decisions."
bad,"I worked at DG for almost 3 years. While the managers are paid well; everyone else is paid as little as possible. They wanted to start me at $10 as ASM. Corporate gives the store very few hours to operate on.. While told not to work off the clock as key holder I never got to sit for my unpaid lunch as I had to do voids, etc. Worked like a crazy person performing several tasks at a time."
bad,"I’ve worked for the dollar general company for over 5 years. In my 5 years I’ve witnessed more turn over in stores than I ever have at any additional convenience store. Due to their lack of compassion for their employees, you are tasked with impossible standards to uphold on a limited hour budget. I’ve worked off the clock, worked and did tasks above my pay grade and were made promises that could never be kept. However the one good thing they offer is flexible hours!"
bad,Fast paced. Alot of work expected but not given enough man hours to complete the task in. Extremely hard to stay caught up and very easy to fall behind. I enjoyed the work itself but the demands from corporate get continually impossible.
bad,"Working at Dollar General warehouse is very stressful and tiring . The pay is good but you really wouldn’t be able to have a life outside of that warehouse . This job is NOT for everybody, only good thing is it will help you lose weight ."
bad,In my honest opinion they are ok but they don't really off the flexibility and allot of time I had to choose between my kids and my job and missed allot on their life and school functions yeah promotions come with bigger responsibility but parents have a responsibility to their kids when they are little as well and I was promised they work with me but never did
bad,It really sucks after all the time i gave dollar general to have the feelngs i do. I worked my butt off everyday got us thru some bad times. Was always ready and willing to go above and beyond working waaayyy to many hrs for one person. Putting my personal life on the back burner. But dedicated myself to that place only to get kicked to the curb when they couldnt use me anymore and i might cost them some money. It was my maternity leave time and right before christmas!! They were not gonna pay me to sit home during this busy time of year i knew it was coming but was repeatedly assured by my boss that everything was fine and i didnt have to worry....i was thrown out first oppurtunity they saw to do so like i didnt mean nothing...they preach customer 1st but they need to learn employees first sometimes cause that place dont run itself!! Just sayin!
bad,"You run a register, help customers and clean. Easy and basic. Most of my coworkers were good people, nice and friendly. Store Manager was ok. Good job for someone looking to get some customer service experience. Not the greatest pay or benefits but great co-workers."
bad,"Family dollar pays much more than dollar general.The pay is a huge joke.Dollar General  has been around for over 80 years. They can afford to pay their employees much more then they do. They pay chump change and want you to work very hard.They expect you to work like their paying you 20 an hr when they pay minium wage. If it wasnt for the pay, employment would be decent."
bad,"I love all my coworkers, however, the work entailed is not worth the compensation. Part time shift leaders cannot go over 29 hours per week unless approved by the district manager. Full time shift leaders cannot go over 35-39 hours. Part time Cashiers are unable to work more than 25 hours a week. A lot of work to do in short amounts of time, most of the time impossible to complete the tasks at hand due to how busy the store gets and how short the shifts are."
bad,"No work/life balance. Was told they would work around my college hours, but they weren’t very well considered. Write ups were given out frequently as we were a focus store and we had to be made examples of, as stated by our District Manager. They max out part-time workers, and our store specifically was known for its huge turnover rate. The kind of job you need if you do not have a family, children, school, or other important obligations."
bad,"It was a fast paced work , with lots of heavy lifting with little consideration for the health of their employees. It had good benefits and time off. I didn't mind the physical labor but after throwing cases of antifreeze case by case and pallet by pallet it became a little to much for the baby to handle. Besides I bid into a lift driver job but they kept farming me to case pack wich was really taxing on the body."
bad,This was my first job. To get any other job I needed experience. At Dollar general you do not need experience you just have to be a hard worker. You’ll learn a lot of good skills for other jobs.
bad,"The only thing that kept me tied to this company for so long was a paycheck and the ability to have insurance for my children and myself. It's a great place if you sty in a cashier position forever, maybe even a key-holder and don't let the Man get ya down. Anything Assistant or over is suicide. Your personal life ends. You get called in on the daily, I was personally a store manager, that had to fight tooth and nail to be given my store that i was thrown into against my will as a key-holder with no training because they had nobody else that wanted it and I was already there keeping it afloat. They made me keep the store up for EIGHT months promising me in would take month tops, jumping through hoop after hoop for it. Legal hold up they claimed, could promote anyone internally they claimed, even though it was a customer-ready store. I was manager officially for 6 months before I saw date for training class.The District managers can be snakes. I was blessed with an amazing one for a short time, and he made our lives awesome. WE saw him frequently for positive reasons. He moved districts and were given The Wicked Witch of the West who was obviously still sour about that house-dropping incident. She played store managers left nd right until they either quit, stepped down, or she could snake out a bologna write-up that a dummy would accept. I was not one. She could never give me a write up and grew very upset with it, coming in bi-weekly threatening to find ANYTHING she could to put me a PIP, the final step before terminating. After working my seventh day, on a busy Saturday we"
bad,I was the Assistant manager and had to work overtime that I was not paid for. My store manager would sneak extra breaks into my hours to keep me from having the overtime that I worked and wouldn't tell me. The pay was not enough for the tasks that were asked of me.
bad,I usually work the truck and the register. I have not learned anything. The management is decent but they just do not care. The workplace is alright and my coworkers are super friendly.
bad,Customer care is a paramount to the company and an assurance of customer satisfaction will keep in store sales consistent. The demanding qualifications for the jobs are not challenging very good to gain experience in sales.
bad,Wage isn't enough for what the job requires. Management was OK but I felt stuck and didn't see myself moving up at that job. But mostly it was the pay.
bad,I don't recommend to work here not because the people are bad you just have to do so much and you don't get any pay it is bad but the manger is nice and the people are nice and thats all I can thank
bad,There is no work life balance being a manager for dg.If you are off they call for you do things and you only get that one day off and sometimes its not enough hours so you have to work 17 days at a time with no day off
bad,"Management had favorites, her favorites got payed more even though they worked less than the part-time while being full time. Part-time workers had to do most of the office work, while getting paid to do only the basic jobs"
bad,"Company is wonderful. I still shop there, they are ran by different management now. Shouldn’t get into personal problems. But it was all personal to me."
bad,"Ok place to work, some good employees and , some bad employees. Love the customers that shope at dollar general. Great assistant manger. Training is good. Love the time."
bad,"It's a good start off job, but unless you're a person who's working just to stay active, it's not a job I would recommend you stay at for a long time."
bad,"Surprised to see how little was done with a District Manager that was getting complaints from vendors, employees, and customers alike. There was zero respect for employees. Anybody else would have been reprimanded in one way or another, but he remained unscathed due to seniority. Aside from that, loved working with my crew and always happy to see our customers."
bad,"I worked as a Store manager in a very diverse neighborhood. It's typically a busy area and has many customer's.  At times, it was very difficult to keep up with demands, due to the constant customer and product loads.  The job did not have a very balanced work/life balance."
bad,I loved my job and was good at it but this company is all about the money. I was told I had to take a vacation day for a funeral and was denied family leave. This is why I quit
bad,Manager told employees to dispose merchandise by means of dumpster instead of by protocols. Constantly yelling and cursing at all employees and blaming whoever walked in first for whatever was going wrong. Complaints were made to district managers and retaliation took place. Manager takes credit for all work done while leaving her team to deal with her hostility. Sets employees up to be terminated. Treats customers badly when they ask for help. District does nothing to protect or fix issues. I will never spend another penny in that store.
bad,The work that I did there was great they just stopped working me and they did not know what they were doing. I did like to work there except for the fact that I had to work that day and I never got paid.
bad,Customer friendly good personality likes to deal with the public cashier and asst manager at dollar general and currently working at ridge runner liquor
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here unless you can handle the physical work, and have no plans for anything outside of work and maybe sleep."
bad,"hard work long hours,friendly customers,and friendly staff. it was always a pleasure going to work daily,just seeing happy customers with a smile on their faces after leaving the store"
bad,"I enjoyed working at DG but once I started working more and doing more for the company I never got promoted or recommendation, they kind of used me and didn't care what I was doing. They overworked me and a lot of the times had me as the only employee scheduled by myself."
bad,"Lack of communication, unorganized, not a friendly environment or culture, very disrespectful and unfair place to work. Scheduling is horrible, sometimes less than 24 hour notice, for OT"
bad,They were very good at having dinners for the holidays but lack of days of for holidays was a problem. Pay was good overall but by the hour was poor. Not enough people for the work.
bad,For those looking for employment here be prepared that this dollar general is extremely fast paced due to customer demand. It is a very nice and friendly place to work that gives you a great deal of skill in the store ie. being the 'jack of all trades'. However due to poor scheduling be prepared to be expected to work all tasks given while rushing back and forth from the sales floor to the register. I would recommend better scheduling from this company and a bigger budget bracket to hire more employees for the store that is placed 3rd in sales in the nation. I believe two employees should be placed on the sales floor at all times while two at the register to ensure shrink reduction and that both areas are being well kept and worked at all times (including for night shifts).
bad,the hours are vary flexible depending if the store manager wants to work with you. the place is nice and peaceful at times.  hours are ok for part time but being the only income in the house it hurts us. hours keep getting cut and they expect to much on low hours.
bad,"Dollar general likes to hire from within making it fairly easy to be promoted. You just have to be dependable and productive. If you see an open opportunity, ask about it."
bad,Slow work pace just varies on how much business that came in not enough hours to live on but made it work management wasn't to good and wasn't very clean
bad,I not that bad off a job but you work way hard then what they pay you for and mangers don’t even know what the are doing and it is unde staff only two people per shift
bad,"I liked working at dollar general, the manager and other employees were very good people to work with and the work wasn't bad at all, just didnt get enough hours or pay"
bad,They expect to much out of any one employee with very little pay and no help.  On a truck day they only staff two employees during a shift one key holder to stock and check in truck and as needed on register etc and one cashier to usually run an busy store
bad,You have to be fast to work there. I loved my team I was with. My store manager took everyone needs into mind when making the schedules. But only so much could be done. I got lucky and had a good team. But before those people got there it was a lot on me. You have to be able to be given a task and complete it as quick as possible and correctly.
bad,DM management was unfair and very hard to work for.. I spent 50 hours or more a week working 6 days a week if not more could never see my family. staffing was horrible
bad,"There was always something to do and something to handle in the store, for everyone, not just the managers.  It was always busy and full of customers."
bad,"I have learned a lot through working here. Telling people no, and also how to better handle people when they are upset. The co-workers here were good, I loved working with them and getting to know them. The hardest part of the job was the constant change in schedule without the knowledge that it has changed. The manager would change it around, and because I lived so close I would get many more hours than I originally thought when I applied and since it is a minimum wage job, not to much pay either. The best part of the job was the great customers and co-workers."
bad,"It would be a great place to work (I enjoy the job), but staffing is too low to provide the service the customers DESERVE!  Work load requirements are way to high for the amount of pay that is received.  If they company would compensate for the work to be done, they would have a MUCH HIGHER quality of staff.  If you pay minimum wage, you are going to get minimum work.  This appears to be the consensus of most every employee (current and former) that I know.  It's a shame.  I would love to make this my career, but good workers go unappreciated!!!!!"
bad,The management in here is horrible!! I been here for over 5 years and nothing has gotten better here. Only good things is the pay but it sucks you have to work extremely hard for a decent check
bad,"enjoyable part are the friendly regulars"
bad,"Lots of stocking and store recovery, using tills and answering customer questions. Benefits are decent but could be better as well as pay. Especially considering the amount of angry people you deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Not enough pay but a lot of physical work.... and long hours ... always short staff..and management always available... to much physical work and no pay...
bad,"Assist’s customers in a positive, approachable manner. My responsibility was to make sure that the store was clean and fully stocked.  Help customers with any questions or concerns.  Calculated daily inventory ran reports.  Unload trucks and placed items were they belong into the stock room.  Then transfer the items from the stockroom into the store."
bad,I loved working with the public. You never know from which day to the next what the primary focus is for the work day. Stocking freight or cleaning. But over all it is a good place to work.
bad,They had a high turnover rate it was very hard to keep employees which put extra pressure on the ones we had. For single parent you're working for chump change I had to work open and close to even make ends meet.
bad,It was really quiet in dollar general they do not get too many customers just enough. in the down time you usually stock the register was easy to use the manager was really cool
bad,The only issue I had really was the manager. Nice and friendly to begin with but that all changed after I accepted assistant manager position. Treated poorly.
bad,"The job was not too bad it was more the people. Very understaffed. Everyone seemed to be taking off days for silly reasons. Also, the hours I was told I would have upon hiring is not what I got after the job started. Myself and another co worker had to figure it out and take it to the boss, she seemed to want no part of solving the problem."
bad,"Management gave too much to do with too little time because there's never more than 2 people working at the same time. If it gets busy, when it gets busy, nothing else can be done. "
bad,I usually worked as a cashier. You're usually left alone at the registers. You don't see management often. It's not hard just a very dull environment. Get very familiar with customers because they're generally regulars. I enjoyed being able to work alone but at times stressful because managers sometimes were nowhere to be found.
bad,Dollar has good and bad. Schdule is good . District  manager some tell u to do something other not to. They have bad communication skills. They bad chose of hiring. They say the give you discount but don't.  They work you a lot of hours . But no raise. And they don't care if u sick coughing all over the place  they don't send u home to rest. I send someone home cause they were sick. I got in trouble by company but doing. So. I did not like their management. This why I'm not working for them no longer.
bad,"Management was good but the hours were horrible. Could really work on giving employees hours, differently not good for full-time job. Plan on working 7 days a week your first week and then working one day a week"
bad,Your work is unappreciated. When upper management is under pressure they take it out on you and try to make you work 80 hrs a week. They also fibe their own numbers to make their bonuses.
bad,"when i worked at dollar general, i was there for 5 months & after 2 months of being there i was promoted to a lead sales associate. i was being paid $7.75 for a managers position pretty much, and she started cutting my hours so i gave notice, and quit to persue another job."
bad,"Never enough hours or staff,no help from upper management often work alone trying to get everything done and wait on customers. No work life balance. DMs constantly coming and going."
bad,Unless you're at the top of your game all of the time you fall behind. With limited hours in payroll you are set at exactly enough hours for assigned tasks with no leeway.
bad,"Dollar General was filled with good staff that did respect one another but after some time the store lost its charm and the associates stopped respecting one another. The manager was always nice and helpful to his customers and even went in at 530 am to start unloading the truck on weekends. He was a hard worker and friendly to add, but he has one associate that was mean, cold, stand-offish and overall just unpleasant to be around not only with her fellow associates but also the customers."
bad,"Although it can be a good place to work I think the workers don't get paid well enough for the work that they do. That being said I think it is a good starting job or a good second job. The hardest part as a sales associate is trying to get everything done by standards as well as running the register. That's also probably one of the hardest parts as a key holder, because not only do you have to get everything out on time but you have make sure that your sales associate's lines aren't too long, money is right, every key turn is up to you, making difficult choices (because you are manager on duty),  and making sure your customers are satisfied every time they walk into your store. The customers and the regulars that come in make it worth it though. When a customer walks out with a smile on their face because of you makes it all worth the trouble."
bad,"Working there was great at first, but after awhile they start pushing you down. They gave me a chance at being a store manager, but I had to step down after my assistant started turning everyone against me. After that they started treating me poorly and made me hate my job."
bad,The management could have been better and  working around the associates schedule when they need days off pay a little more because it’s a lot to take in at the especially when being a key holder manger
bad,"I did not enjoy working at dollar general at all. the staff was nice, but i felt alone most of the time. when the are no customers you have to do inventory, but the way the store is set up you cannot see the cash register so you never know when customers are ready until they come looking for you and are angry. almost everyday i worked they tried to get me to work overtime was was impossible for me at the time as i relied on others for transportation and they were not understanding."
bad,"It's a good place to work if you are paid hourly.  But if you're a salaried manager, in most cases I have seen, you are overworked and it can be very stressful."
bad,I was never properly trained for all the daily needs and process. I was given a store that was not customer ready. I worked very hard to take a bottom earning store back u to #5 out of 14 in the district. I am a very hard and dedicated worker and manager but the lack of concern for the managers and store employees took the wind out of my sales.
bad,"There is no culture and no training in this company.  You are thrown in a disaster store and expected to turn it around with 1 person coverage.  This is why store managers generally work 60+ hours a week.  You have a mandatory 6 day work week and at least one time a week you are going to have to work from 8am-10pm, because employees call out because they are generally scheduled for 12-20 hours a week at little above minimum wage.  The work placed on the store manager is more than overwhelming.  You have to do multiple store resets every other week, unload a 900-1200 piece truck(may or may not have help).  The is no time to actually do management administrative work, because the district manager is always asking for something to be done with no notice and knowingly know there is only one person on duty.  The position is very rigorous on your body and the company doesn't even offer sick leave.  They say you get a lunch, however you can not do that if there is no coverage and if there is coverage its against policy to leave the property.  After all the hours per week, the pay is actually only like 9-10 dollars a hour."
bad,"I did not like working here. The customers were very rude and there was always something wrong with the register. As a cashier, the management expected you to take on many roles. I had to scan customers items and stock the shelves. Hardly any help from others and needed a manager key for almost everything at the register."
bad,Dollar General will leave you in the store alone with no cashier. No Manager will answer the phone whenever they are off if you needed them to come in. Management is way under paid for the work we do.
bad,It was one of the easiest job I had but management wasn’t never around to help or they were always leaving and the store manager never followed the smoking rules
bad,"what was most frustrating, lack of qualified help, inability to hire people in timely fashion, odd process to hire people, back stock, back stock, back stock....starting pay for hourly low in compared to Walmart...I wanted to really like this job, but empty promises by corporate left a bad taste"
bad,I was treated harsh and felt different because i am a beautiful white woman. i felt like i had to pick up more slack from others because they want to express their view of white privilege upon me. customers and employees.
bad,Slow paced. Not great benefits. Low pay scale and not great for career advancement opportunities and being financially stable. Great life/daily balance.
bad,Decent place to work for a store manager all though there is not much managing going on mostly a glorified stocker they offer very little labor and when it come to ideas they have plenty of them but no plan to implement them. The communication with you and upper management is very poor and the people they choose to take these positions should not be the individuals in the position.
bad,Dollar General was a stressful work place because i was the Assistant Manager and people would come in the store back to back stealing to the point where i was no longer comfortable. I did not feel safe at all when I was working here.
bad,i really loved working with the customers   an making them laugh an being able to help them find what they needed or was looking for /worse part trying to service customers clean outside.an recovery
bad,"Not worth the pay to do that much work, and back breaking work at that.  You'll wish you hadn't applied.  If you really need a job try a convienance store the hours might not be as good but the work for the same pay is much better."
bad,The company expects their employees to be hard working and honest. Sometimes this is carried to an extreme.  Working with the customers can be difficult in the local store that I worked in.  That may be different with other districts.
bad,"On average, I'd work about 50 hours a week. The pay was good to me and bonuses were a plus. It would have been great to keep a district manager for longer than a couple of months. There were many deadlines to meet which I always welcomed but the constant changing of leadership at the district manager position made it hard to develop any type of rapport and continuity. I really enjoyed the team building."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was fast paced work with little coverage most of the time. I learned that they offer limited hours to different stores over the course of the week, i learned to open and close the store, handle the money, and work the merchandise in the store. My first manager i wasn't to fond of but the second was doing what she was supposed to and working with me as a student and worker. The workplace could have been better but was progressing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a bunch of constant changes and consistently getting talked down on. The most enjoyable part of the job was my loving customers."
bad,I loved being a cashier and I had a respectable mouth tords the customers including my coworkers I just didn't like that there where always 2 people in the store
bad,Working for dollar general is a decent temporary choice. I don't see making a career out of working at dollar general. There isn't enough benefits to working to compensate the lack of pay or lack of advancement.
bad,"Training, minimum. Stress, maximum. Wages, terrible. Hours, terrible. Use as a stepping stone to a better  job only unless you can get promoted fast. Not the best environment for building a career."
bad,"Dollar General is just a miserable place to work, overall. Lousy environment, lousy pay, lousy hours. Just consider it a ""holdover"" job before you get a job that pays your worth."
bad,"Really a mess overall. The neighborhood was not safe, very dangerous. After a week of working there I was told that the store I was transferred to was robbed at gun point. I didn't stay long after that."
bad,Worked long hour and lost a lot of time with family. Never at home. Worked to many hours and DM was not a nice person at all. He would bully you to get his way.
bad,"I received a raise after I reached seniority and it ""left"" as soon as minimum wage increased. I realized that difference would make $1,560 annually..."
bad,Stores are a mess DM or AM will not send help to clean the stores. Store managers are there all the time working 50 plus hows weekly on salary. There is know work/life balance. Very very stressful job with low pay.
bad,Very slow job and very little hours for me even though they said it'd pick up after the new store opened. I decided to leave on my own terms and find a new career in something that I might actually be able to live off of.
bad,Just don’t want to be associated with dollar general it was not great it was something i didn’t feel comfortable working  with them it wasn’t the greatest experience
bad,I had  great customers and they really liked me. My manager was never in the store and I was working over 50 hours per week to cover for him. Turn over rate was terrible and had many part timers that we had to work around before we knew as additional management what our hours where.
bad,management work long hours training is minimal to none they only show you how to push fright hardest part of the job is working only and most enjoyable is weekly pay
bad,Cashiers weren’t allowed to work more than thirty nine hours a week. Was always short handed. New manager wouldn’t give me more hours as I was only working 20 a week.
bad,I had a bad experience at the one where I worked at.  I went in as an assistant manager.  I was not being trained.  The manager hated training she had someone else do it.  She left due to something personal for two weeks.  Very understandable she was dealing w things.  She changed her number and gave it to the lady that was training me.  Told her nobody else is to have her number.  The district manager came in to help me train and I listened to him.  Well I got in trouble and was told to never listen to the district manager that she's my boss I do what she says.  The lady that was training me told me to go home early cause I was there a long time already.  I got yelled at and was told never to change her schedule. I said I was told to go home by the lady u put n charge.  She said u heard me I said yes ma'am.  Then these two other cashiers come in when they want change the hrs a lot and talks to others with disrespect.  One girl didn't like me and snatched the register from me and talked down on me.  She was wrote up twice the next day she did a no call no show.  They still let her come back.  The manager came back told me to step up.  Lol I was alone on a friday and I did what I could cause she never showed.  But when I went in the store wasn't recovered and nothing was said to them.  I love my job and bust my butt.  I was so confused what was right what was wrong.  So I did just walk out.  I couldn't work for someone like that.  Come to find out the girl threatened to hit me.
bad,"For a summer job, it was quite stressful. I had to deal with rather rude customers, which is to be expected at times, but often times, rude co-workers as well. The store dealt with frequent overstock, having a truckload coming every week,even though it was not needed. Corporate had to send someone down to the store and practically tell everyone was doing an awful job, and speak to the workers as if they were still children. Management was very relaxed, but to a degrading point. If one person called out, either me or another coworker would be the first one called to do the shift, every single time."
bad,"A typical day work includes a set list of tasks such as cleaning and stocking divided as the manager sees fit. This list is normally weighted down on one person in the later shifts to do the cleaning, stocking, and/or recovery. The other worker normally at the register waiting to take care of customers or doing so. The cashier then has the right to call the second worker for help if he feels its needed."
bad,Stocking was the hardest part of the job cashiering was easiest.  The manager was mean and not understandable. She said that I was slow and she let me go I feel she didn't give me chance or train me properly she put out there alone.
bad,bad setup and long hours hard to change departments very tideous stacking process for that type of order filling your working until the next shift arrives
bad,this job was veery easy and the management was a bit crazy but for the most part they had everything under control. didnt get much hours so probably need a second job
bad,Dollar General is one of the best and worst places I have ever worked. It was the fastest job to get promoted but once you are up there that is when the job starts to go downhill. Not enough employees and not enough pay. Job was fun until we ran out of employees and basically got worked to death.
bad,A typical work day would consist of a fast paced afternoon and slow paced night shift. The hardest part of the job was clarifying sales and coupons for items.
bad,"If you like to be over worked, over stressed, and get low pay come work for  this company.  So much responsibility and major management hangs over you. Needs benefits and pay increase."
bad,very relaxed job and a busy workplace also I learned how to use the register and do inventory. Management was very well organized and workable to work.
bad,Most of my customers were extremely rude and then we did not have enough cashiers. The workload was very demanding for VERY MEAGER pay and no benefits.
bad,"Work was typical for cashier, I only worked here in a part time job. People and customers were nice and friendly. Different every day  but in an enjoyable way."
bad,"Miscommunication is a HUGE problem. Advancing isn't an option at this time (and doesn't appear to be anytime soon), and my boss refuses to relocate me to better serve my new availability. I want balance both my home life and my work life, but there is no possible way for me to do that at this time due to my boss's incapability to negotiate/accommodate."
bad,They hire people on as part time and it is very part time. The problem is they cut so many hours so things start to look terrible in the store. boxes are everywhere and even for people who work there its hard to find stuff.
bad,"I was the assistant Manager for DG,"
bad,"The location I was working at was under-staffed, poorly managed and just a constant disaster. For minimum wage I had to manage the cash register, stock shelves, clean the restrooms, sweep, and mop the floors all while the assistant manager was outside smoking a cigarette, and they would get mad at me if the line for check out got long. I would not recommend anyone work there."
bad,Sometimes I was the only one scheduled. Not a good place to work ...no security measures in place. I had to take the deposit to the bank and no one was with me. I could have been robbed. They should have had armored trucks picking up deposits.
bad,"Push stock, run cash register, keep employees busy , opened and closed store, made deposits I learned that my multi-tasking skills came in handy Not a hard job. Balancing at the end of the day!"
bad,had a great job until district manager changed and then the quality of leadership diminished. Superiors neglected vital aspects to complete job properly. Allowed harassment from city officials and provided false information regarding transfer for several months so i resigned.
bad,When first started for Dollar General I left workers I worked with coworkers gave me good experience in this field moved on to another Dollar General and did not have the same experience there because assistant manager.
bad,"This company has unorganized and not properly trained. The job itself is easy and i enjoyed working there. i learned more cashier experience and how to use hhc (hand held computer) The lose prevention is the WORST that i've ever experienced on a job. just my personal experience: i was held up by gunpoint and it took them 2 weeks to come and talk with me about what had happened, The regional manager NEVER spoke with me about the robbery. The best part about my job was recovering shelves and the re pore i developed with my customers."
bad,Work days were stressful and the manager expected you to do many things at once that was not possible. Would come in around 5 just to stock and then have to stay longer because other called out.
bad,"This is a company for someone who doesn't have a personal life. They work you as if you area a machine or slave. Some district managers don't care about you or your personal life.They expect you (if you are part of management) to work anywhere from 8-15 hours a day. Store managers, some district managers expect 10-16 hours per day. Don't think about having 2 days off that's unheard of.You may get 1 day and a half. I've never seen a company like this. Their turnover is off the charts due to the way they treat their managers,"
bad,"If you enjoy working for a company with high turnover, unreasonable expectations that is not invested in hourly associates I highly recommend Dollar General."
bad,"I would not recommend dollar general to anyone unless you just really need the money. There are usually no more than three people if that even working in the whole store at a time. If you apply for one position, you are basically going to end up doing them all."
bad,"I worked as a cashier and I really enjoyed my time there.  I had a very good relationship with most customers, they were friendly and most were honest.  I got along very well with my coworkers and with management."
bad,"Pretty much any time the district manager shows up they have absolutely ridiculous orders. We aren't allowed to do certain things that would be incredibly helpful, like put a service bell on the register so that the cashier can know when a customer is at the register when out of view b/c of stocking & recovery, corporate doesn't seem to have any idea about how things work at the store level, we get punished for not being able to finish certain things that are borderline impossible on account of being so busy, we don't even get an employee discount except for on one item once a yr. on ""employee appreciation weekend"", hours don't really change on any holidays excepting Christmas, we were open an extra hour late during the Christmas season, we closed at regular time (10 pm.) on Christmas Eve, corporate doesn't seem to give a care much about employees, and more. . . I've been employed by DG for 4 years, and I honestly hate it."
bad,The store that I worked at is very poorly ran.  The assistant store manager treats everyone poorly & the hours are terrible.  Way too much work for the pay you receive.
bad,"Typically I am the cashier on duty for the evening shift. "
bad,"Dollar General was not very stressful, but you were required to do way too much for just $7.25 an hour. At times, I was left at the store by myself with no form of management to help me. We were required to stock shelves, run registers, answer phones, count our drawers, and clean. "
bad,i liked working there but my manager had issues i worked har for the time i was there but it was not appreciated at all each time i did something good my dm found fault with something else
bad,"I was not properly trained at all I basically was just thrown to the wolves, one of the managers of the store was doing drugs and having relations in the back of the store and allowing her friends who were on drugs steal from the store"
bad,Work load is hard to keep up with required duties.Pay is less than other retailers. Vacation time is lost if you don' take (even if you give 2 weeks notice when you leave). Salary position requires you to put in more hrs than the 48 hrs required.
bad,"If you don't wish to attend school or any other activies in life then, this is a great job. They promote you quickly with no training. They give you 40 hours on the dot or above if your full time but less than 10 if youre part. this job is overworked and no where near the job description. refusal of a transfer or willing to work with exam times for college."
bad,"Had a few living situation issues and had to relocate. Ended up still working there . Called in once four hours before my shift. I had nobody to watch my son . Which the call in was according to regulations . She fired me. Everytime I go to shop there the store is unorganized , dirty and there are rodants.Caught one while I was in the check out. Took the mouse outside."
bad,"As Supervisor, my time there was the longest 4 years of my life.  Long days, Upper Management that always wanted more from the Supervisors and low pay for the amount of hours worked"
bad,There was always drama and rumors spread. Some of the employees were very messy. There wasn't any work getting done with smoke breaks every 30 minutes.
bad,I do not mind working here but the money im making is not realy helping me with my wife and daughter. Best if your in school and need a little bit of $
bad,A typical day at work would be working the register. I learned how to run a cash register and I learned how to effectively stock shelves for maximum sales. Management was uncooperative and mean at times. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of my job was learning the cash register. The most enjoyable part of my job was greeting and helping customers.
bad,dollar general is not a horrible company to work for but it is not the greatest company. I would not and will tell everyone to not make it a career. There pay is hourly and they start at minimum wage going to 10.50 for me as an assistant manager. They expect way more from MODs when some days its impossible when you are at the store by yourself trying to run register and working on the floor.
bad,"The manager that I was supposed to be training with, was more concerned a bout training someone that she had a personal potential romantic interest in."
bad,This environment taught me valuable skills. Not every place will be an ideal work environment but I learned to make the best out of a negative situation.
bad,I met some good people while working for this company but not enough time during shift to finish task that you are assigned.
bad,"It paid my bills, so I didn't  mind it as much. I wasn't impressed with the management, she never had the schedule out on time and i never knew when i was going to work. I ran the register and cleaned the store, I learned a little more patience and to keep my mouth shut."
bad,"Management was terrible, very hypocritical, favorites and had cliques. I truly felt un welcomed in my work environment. Very misunderstanding and has no sensitivity. Would not work with my availability after I told them about if multiple times."
bad,Every manager I had while I worked for Dollar General was incompetent and struggled to keep a full staff. The job itself is pretty easy but it gets old so very fast.
bad,Overall the experience has been positive.  Would like to see a little more emphasis put on support from the management above the store level.  Extremely fast paced and by the seat of your pants.  Ideal for a young up-comer looking to move on to a better company once they gain some store level experience.
bad,"A typical day of work required many tasks. I learned to multitask and handle customers along with customer complaints well. I learned how to stock and stock efficiently. I improved some of their record keeping. The management and co-workers above me treated this store as if we were in high school. My manager was not very professional by any means. If you upset her personally, somehow, she took away hours. The hardest part of the job was dealing with such an unstable boss. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing customers return and being satisfied with my service."
bad,The amount of work for the amount pay is sad and pathetic.  The physical pain I am in daily is awful due to all the work they expect from us.  It is impossible to get it all done.
bad,i did not like the environment. Most of the customers were rude but some of the staff were nice. Basically this is just a place holder job. I do not consider it a career.
bad,"Managers worked 6 days a week.  My immediate supervisor was not involved with my store at all.  Had a very low payroll budget, so I had run the store alone most days.  I had to learn to manage my time wisely in order to allow myself to get planograms and ads set, deliveries logged in, trucks unloaded and shelves stocked, and do cycle counts all while running the register.  I would say there is job security if you are willing to stand the punishment."
bad,I worked here as a part-time job in college I worked nights and every weekend at night. I had not balance for anything. They have sales challenges that say you should sell 1 1/2 Pesi's per hour. I thought they gave some work that was impossible to finished with the accommodations they provided us with. I would never go back to them again.
bad,"Very flexible with hours although you only get about 15hrs a week.  it is hard to become a full time employee even for those who been with the company for over 2yrs.  No holiday pay is given, no benefits and are requited to work during lunch if needed with no over time which by the way I believe is illegal."
bad,I enjoy the job on a relaxed day not so busy days& running from cash register to stock to customer and then cash register then putting back what they didn't want gets annoying very fast in all if you like people you may enjoy it my big issue is the pay is low as a crew member your responsibility is to much and assistant managers don't do enough they tended to use lower payed people I wouldn't mind if they paid more
bad,"If opening, get cash registers open and balanced."
bad,the management was very unprofessional and very hard to work with. she made the work environment very stressful and uncomfortable.
bad,"As a shift manager, you do walk-throughs, train and monitor new employees, work as cashier, complete, daily deposits and cash flow. Recover, stock, and clean. And often, you are in the store alone."
bad,"Fun place to work and grow. The management is not very fair when it comes to certain things, and do not always want to listen to their employees."
bad,"No time for family, if your working 35 hrs on the schedule then off the schedule you'll be getting overtime which means no family time. And I could see if the pay was worth it, but at 50 or more hours a week and the pay? Not worth it at all."
bad,Dollar General generally has a consistent work flow that can be overwhelming at times. Needs better Management. raises take way too long.
bad,"Great training to deal with different situations and different people.  Opened and closed the store as a key holder, made up and did deposits."
bad,"For me, this was not a good company to work for.  Pushing managers to the breaking point, For the expectations, the pay was very poor."
bad,Provide good customer service. Assist customers when needed as well as employees. Meeting new people was always a joy.
bad,I hope I am not working for this company much longer. It is a very unprofessional place and not clean.
bad,"I would come into work usually early mornings say 5 or 6 am. We would start by either stocking straight off the truck or just start pulling from the back. When I first started there was a time frame but no one was really timed. The store I was at is very high volume which means lots of product goes out so a lot comes right back in through trucks. The stock literally is busting out of this stores backroom onto the floor. The whole store needed to be recovered bad and was very messy. We rushed ourselves to our best to stock but at the end of the day we barely put a dent in it. This was due to the lack of employees since this job has a high turnover (quit, fire, etc.) and the store DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A STORE MANAGER. One assistant manager in general was very sexist and power hungry, she took charge over everyone and I believe is the core problem with that store. By the time I started and quit 6 people had done the same, some started slightly before and some slightly after me. Soon I heard an additional 3 people quit by the next month. Also the company decided we had to right our times down on a sheet and to meet the requirements for each type of stock, RIDICULOUS expectations for some of the types and I was one of the faster stockers. They also started taking up our cell phones which actually ended up slowing down our times vs. speeding them up since we were able to listen to music while we worked which soon turned in to a school/prison type environment. So overall it depends if the store looks good and if the management is good because the job was cake."
bad,"typical day at work would include customer service, stocking shelves, seasonal displays,reading reports,training employees"
bad,"Upon hiring I was promised advancement opportunities but after months of employment it just depended on who was liked most at moment and not based on job performance, seniority, or dependability."
bad,"As Store Manager, I was given few hours to accommodate the business needs. The working hours were unreasonable and the pay for non-management employees was so terrible that I couldn't keep any decent personnel."
bad,Don't have a work/life balance. Work insane amount of hours and work that I do is never enough.
bad,"I work at a training store for store managers, so my experience with the company is different than that of regular stores since we are held to a higher standard. However, the shifts I work are pretty typical. I do cashier work throughout the week, which involves me ringing up well over 100 customers in 4-6 hours while also trying to balance cleaning duties, and assist with paperwork at the end of the night. Management tends to be incompetent to a degree, but most regular shifts go by pretty smoothly despite the fact that regular cashiers can't even void out items or change prices on their own if necessary for customers."
bad,"The district manager is a flip flopper or a person who is there for the money only. The reason I say this is because before I became assistant manager for one of the stores, the district manager expressed how I was a great asset to the store but soon as the new store manager got her codes or whatever they acted like they didn't want me there. It went from the store manager illegally editing my time (making it seem like I was taking breaks when I wasn't) to her telling the district manager I was giving the her and the customers a hard time. She even lied to him and I said I didn't recover the store. After going over with her about her editing my time for the third time I decided to go over her and the district manager's head. After that I became the enemy. Just a bunch of mess."
bad,"It's a fun place to work,but the people there are very un-organized. The management,is very poor and the cleanliness is very odd!"
bad,"Stocked shelves,ran register - unloaded truck on truck day."
bad,"Very typical job. However, the management seemed like they needed more training. Rules should be enforced the same for every employee."
bad,"Work there to gain experience, not retirement. It was an okay place to work, the hardest part is the random quitting of employees. Co workers are okay, but they will mostly be young and inexperience. the most enjoyable part was that my coworkers actually worked."
bad,"Upon arriving at work, I would clock in and begin by delegating out the responsibilities for my shift, help with refilling the stock and putting out what shipment has been received. My co-workers were great we had lots of laughs while working and management was great. The hardest part of the job was what they were paying and balancing work and home."
bad,"I come in, tall till to the bank, open the store, send out the outside items, then I prepare the cashier's till. During the day i put away product still waiting to be stocked, refund customers who need it, and change prices on sales as they come and go. I learned to count down drawers and manage people for performing multiple kinds of tasks while effectively remaining as the cashier. Dollar General is frugal with their hours per store and make it difficult to cover shifts when someone calls out, it also makes earning a living difficult when hours are cut down to single digits per employee consistently. Getting everything done during the day that needs to be done.I enjoyed learning about management and what needed to be done to achieve success."
bad,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers with their purchases. In between customers I would stock the shelves while keeping any eye out on the front register. I have learned that nothing truly comes easy, and you must work hard to get what you want out of life. The management at Dollar General are very strict on policy and rules and regulations. I love the people I work with. My co-workers are what makes the long days seem much shorter. I would have to say the hardest thing about the job at times is when I am ringing up customers while being the only one out on the sales floor. The lines can get pretty long some days.The thing I love the most about working here are the different types of people I get a chance to meet each day."
bad,"Unless you want to be stressed all the time and under constant pressure to fulfill unrealistic demands, worst job ever."
bad,"The typical work day started with me coming in through the front door to get yelled at by my boss for something that happened the week before on my day off and threatened with a write-up. Then I would clock in and work the cash register. If I wasn't busy on the cash register, then I would stock shelves. Halfway through my shift, (I worked the night shift), we would start recovery. Also around this time was when it would get very busy and the assistant manager on duty would go on break for an hour, leaving me by myself. If a customer didn't want an item, I had to page the assistant manager because I could not void items out. This was one of the worst job experiences I had."
bad,"Part of your application deals with an ""assessment"""
bad,Did several different jobs but like the International department the best.
bad,it seemed like a good opportunity but it turned out to be a 80 hour baby sitting job with not enough hours to have employees there to work causing the manager to work open to close shifts
bad,I like the job and I like my direct manager but the corporation allows the stores to degrade to the point of health hazards. There is black mold growing in our store that they refuse to do anything about and it has started to make our employees sick. Our shipments come in after sitting for days in the trucks in the hot summer heat because of delays causing hundreds of dollars in damages every week and anything that doesn't get caught gets sold to the customers. All of this and we still aren't the most ignored store in our district. One of our stores has mold so badly the back bathroom had to be closed off from public use and the store manager has fallen through the floor and the corporation still has done nothing to fix these locations.
bad,A day full of customer service and training the crew to meet the needs of the customers.
bad,I enjoy the opportunity to interact with DMs and store team members.
bad,"Co-workers and I worked well together. A typical day at work composed of opening and closing of store, stocking, sales, updating sales to loss ratios. I caught on very quickly to my new environment and had been accepted into a general manager training program. Unfortunately, the store was extremely understaffed, leaving myself working seventy or more hours a week. I was brought on part time. The daily customers is what I miss most. I really enjoy seeing the familiar faces getting to know my customer base."
bad,"A typical day at work isn't all in all so bad, I usually work the cash register during closing hours and help with recovery and cleaning the store for closing."
bad,go stock the shelves up.
bad,Work too many hours per day/week. Do not like working on holidays.
bad,The hardest part of the job is the weight of the items and the number of items you must pick in a row. One item I did weighed 48 pounds and I would have to pick 130 or more each time. Co-workers were great. Management admitted that they probably couldn't do the job either.
bad,The neighborhood that the store is in pretty much tell you what the store is like inside. Not hard work. Conditions have improved over the last few years.
bad,"csh handling, customer satisfaction,ring on register,stock,clean,......i learned how to run the store when you smile it makes the customer smiles mangement was ok the coworkers ws excellent,dealing with management,being round people"
bad,"I'm either on a cash register or stocking/blocking the store at night, making sure everything is in its right place and the store is clean for the next day. i've learned alot about how to read labels and UPC numbers and etc. My Co-workers complain the most about their job and the customers that come into the store to shop. This is why I am looking for a new job. There is not really a 'hard part' of my job everything is easy to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and making their experience the best ."
bad,"Typically, as an entry level employee, this job may seem like a lot to take on. Unlike other retail establishments, if you are a cashier, you are also a stocker, a janitor, and a security guard. There is an immense amount of physical labor. This company is eager to promote within, though training is not optimal."
bad,"Dollar General is a growing convenience chain store. They are your typical retail store in that they have very little concern for their most precious asset - their store managers. They don't have common benefits like sick time or additional paid holidays (for working on Thanksgiving, New Years Day or Easter). Health benefits are high for a company with over 10,000 locations. You are judged solely by your numbers and the frequency with which you see your district manager is based on how far they live from you."
bad,"This is a stepping stone type of job. I would not recommend a job unless you are applying as a manager, or assistant manager. Every store is different and it can be a fun and enjoyable work experience if you have a good store manager."
bad,I mostly ran a cash register and cleaned the store. I would count the tills and lock up at night. It was a very demanding job with little compensation.
bad,I made a miatake one time and the manager yelled at me in front of all the customers instead of pulling me aside very unprofessional. Made customers uncomfortable
bad,assist customers with questions and navigate them to the right department also stock the shelves with the merchandise that comes off the truck and ring out customers items.
bad,If you know someone within the company favoritism sometimes comes into play! Unfortunately even though they encourage people you know to work with you it’s not how it actually is come to working with the company!
bad,You dont get enough hours here unless you're a key holder or assistant manager. The big bosses are kind mean and dont allow the gm to give her employees more hours
bad,i would say it's an ok place to work at when you get out of high school but once you get serious working there manager starts to treat you bad especially if you don't have a reliable ride to work to make the days when i worked there it was ok but as soon i told the manager i didn't have a ride for certain days manager would just put me on schedule anyways and make it seem like i didn't want to work when i would say i didn't have a ride plus i live far from the other location they would assign me to didn't get paid correctly when i work 25-30 hours end up making $45-$60 which i was really upset about
bad,In the store operations management position it is a struggle completing all tasks with the payroll hours given for the stores it can be a very rewarding place to work but at the same time can have a big toll on one's personal life given the time needed for the store to be successful and only having one day off per week
bad,I was left alone majority of the time and the guy I was scheduled with was not helpful and had a bad attitude most of the time. I don’t recommend working there
bad,"Very demanding, no payroll to accomplish tasks. No understanding or help from the company in difficult situations. I worked in a bad neighborhood, robbed multiple times, no corrective measures."
bad,"Dollar general has so many locations that, hours and pay are horrible for the work done.  Due to pay, hours, you most definently would need a second job, if not a store manager."
bad,Very unorganized and hectic! Management was not able to keep up with store demands. The store was very cluttered and unorganized and it was difficult for customers to navigate through the store without running into boxes.
bad,"Working at Dollar General was an okay job, with the store managers that I was under.  But the managers was always stressed about freight, store cleanliness, etc., therefore putting additional stress on the associates.  Also the pay sucks.  Dollar General starts basic associates out at & $7.25/Hour"
bad,I didn’t like it there I had to do everyone else’s work and pull there weight. The people there were friendly. A topical day we would have a range of about 100 customers a day it got really busy there
bad,As a sore manger it is very difficult to do anything at all due to lack of supportive staff & too much work load for the amount of labor hrs they give & especially due to many call-in's. Although you can rehire & retrain new employees it depends on who applies & what area you're in. The amount of weekly duties & getting truck out in 2 days along creates long hrs for store mngr
bad,I've worked at dollar general for about 8 months and since I started I've gotten stuck with the closing shift 6/7 days a week even though the manager and assistant manager are each supposed to close 2 nights a week per policy. Management bends rules and policies because they think it helps customers but all it does is turn them into nightmares for those of us that actually have to deal with them.
bad,"It takes more than two dedicated employees to correctly run a Dollar General store.  There are too many call-offs, not enough coverage and too many lazy people on the payroll."
bad,No money a lot of responsibility..bad management..fun busy customer counting money doing inventory a day in the lifr of retail blah blah blah blaj blah
bad,"Nothing is properly ran correct with the company. A lot of favoritism dirty store and a lot of robberies. Good benefits that I can say, very very good."
bad,There are never enough hours to do what you are expected to get done and beginning pay is not enough to get good quality employees to work for you..my salary was based on 40 hours a week according to my pay stubs but I was required to work no less than 48 and I worked much more without getting paid for it..my District Manager was amazing..but the regional was nothing but a bully
bad,On average I worked over 55 hours a week. I mite get a day off if I’m lucky we have no security so you can get rob at any moment plus you would basically never will be able to take a vacation because if you do you would be so far behind on everything your vacation wouldn’t even be worth it you never have enough payroll so you won’t have your team to help run the store I was just a stressful job and I won’t recommend this job for no one
bad,"The life/work balance is talked about being important but managers work 6 days a week and are expected to come in early, stay late and give up the only day off if someone calls out and no one is available to cover (which happens a lot).  The amount of work expected cannot be completed with the given payroll hours so again the pressure is on for the salaried manager to stay to complete tasks."
bad,"It was a very fast paced job and you were kept very busy. Not many breaks and if there was one it was short. Also it was low pay. The management was pretty good, but the job wasn’t"
bad,"Dollar General was my favorite job I’ve had so far, but it was still pretty bad. Customers are constantly rude to you, no matter how kind you are to them, but I know that’s going to happen in any job where you’re dealing with the public."
bad,Dollar General does higher inside the company before hiring Outsiders when there's higher positions available. The raises are not good and the offered insurance is not the best
bad,"In my experience as a customer and as an previous employee. Quality Customer Service doesn't exsist. They are more focused on getting people in/out as quick as possible not customer service. Also they are always understaffed which makes it harder to do anything on the sales floor such as: stocking, fronting items, and cleaning."
bad,Customers or put away truck. Pick one!!! I hate the running back and forth. I cant get anything done. Its very frustrating. I leave work with no sense of accomplishment.
bad,"First off, the regional manager is so concerned about high turnover rate due to call ins, but they let people go that show up everyday and give their best just because a person stays to themselves and can't reach their expected 100 percent by the 8 the week like myself. Ecpesially if ur thru a temp agency. Thier employees are very helpful  and fun to work with, and are extremely helpful from day one. They have a high turn over rate because of their no tolerance  attendance policy and pick percentages. The Training  you get does not even prepare you . You're supposed to get weekly ramp up meeting with your supervisor to help you gain your percentages but in the 8 or 9 weeks I was there I had 2. Definitely do not get hired thru a temp agency direct only..  The company in general does show alit of family core values and does take care of their employees if you can manage to stay employed. Definitely paid well due to O.T. If you don't like 12 hour days and if you're not 18 to 30 years old I wouldn't look twice at this job because the WMS program they use is based on a younger person's abilities."
bad,I knew I was hired in part time. But part time to me is 25 to 30 hrs. Some weeks I was lucky to even get 20 hours. If your a single parent I wouldn’t recommend you work there unless you can get in full time
bad,This company works the manager to hard not enough payroll for employees so the manager lives there no extra pay  you have to work alone because of budget and the job still has to be done
bad,About the same as Family Dollar.They train some but most stuff you have to learn on your own.Then you get griped at because you don't know how to do stuff or don't know their way.
bad,"Dirty, hard work. Unloading truck deliveries, running register, counting drawers, closing/opening the store. If you like to be treated like a moron by customers, this is the place for you. Always something to do and you better be doing it because you’re on camera and they’ll watch the footage and call you out. Hindsight is 20/20 and if I knew how bad it was I wouldn’t have worked there."
bad,"Does not give me more hours when i ask, only gives me 2 (rarely 3) days to work a week, the pay sucks, and super lazy. Needs better management........"
bad,The closing managers count the sales register drawers in a locked office while the other employee cleaned the store. The money was weighed on a scale not hand counted as a result drawers came up over or short and the person who did not do the counting was wrote up for it!
bad,"It was an alright job, not alot of hours and there was no room to move up in management. They don't offer raises and there was not any benefits. The environment was awesome I loved interacting with the customers and being able to meet new people"
bad,Company policy is ridiculous as far as work to be performed.  No incentive to move up.  Very negative atmosphere. No overtime and very cheap with raises when you can get one.  Talks always of no money and never overtime.
bad,"Any job require you to work hard, and several jobs require you to wear many hats, But Dollar General takes both to extremes. Think of anytime that you have visited their locations. How many employees on average did you see? Often times there are 3 or less employees, of which 1-2 might be actively working. this means they are required to usually stock shelves, assist customers, and run cash registers simultaneously, with little to no managerial support. It is a great environment if you like to work independently with a hectic workflow, but not everyone can be the eye of the storm. I would say it ranges busy to busier, and that can become overwhelming if you don't stay motivated."
bad,The daily pace is very fast. Corporate sets what can sometimes be unrealistic production requirements and will punish or fire those that cannot keep up. Management doesn't always have your back and while competition is encouraged the behavior of the average workers can border on toxic with management egging this behavior on.
bad,Only part time so not enough hours needed to pay bills.  Do not get any breaks unless work over 5 and a half hours.  Coworkers very helpful.  Learn on job.
bad,"Dollar General is good for the elderly if they would promise the hours for part time stay part time, also for the first job with the right training. I would like to work part time but have worked double, it's getting rough on me"
bad,"6 days a week. Only closed on Christmas Day, and that was considered the Managers day off."
bad,my manager was one of a kind.  he was an extremely hard worker and took on all the heavy lifting that needed to be done and worked an ungodly amount of hours because of low staff or no good candidates for the postion
bad,"You cashed people out at the register, you cleaned the store, you stocked the shelves, and you put up sale information. The job was a good one, but Dollar General keeps their stores running with far less employees then they should have. The store I worked in had the manager, and one cashier for pretty much an entire shift. Most of the time as a Lead Sales Associate I would have to shut the store down completely by myself. It was a lot of responsibility but it was also a very laid back job."
bad,"Poor pay, poor staffing budgets, older stores are dirty and unkept. Some are unsafe and have a history of being robbed. So look for proper outside lighting and cameras. High turn over is due to only getting 10-15 hours a week. There's only 4 in the store that get over 30 hrs. the rest of the budget is split giving people 10-15 hrs a week because managers are forced to over staff. But you will still have to work roughly 5 hours all by yourself at least once a week.  No other employee in the building to help with customers or vendors.  Very professional I think.. Their currently used technology looks like its from the 80""s. They put no money back into their stores. They over work their managers and what little crew that stays. BUT it's okay because THEY ARE A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY. that is supported by the public because they don't know the truth and if so still don't matter because neither care. 6 mos I""m out.. YEAH Happy Day!"
bad,A typical day at Dollar General is stocking in the mornings and at nights you clean the store up and straighten up. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing the same faces come in and also leaving at night. :)
bad,"Its not bad to work there as a cashier. The pay sucks, so they use that to get you to move up. Which sounds good to move up. But then once you are a lead or higher, you get yelled and even screamed at. You get called names and are belittled and put down. And I was a favorite employee..."
bad,I enjoy working with my coworkers.....I have a great team and associate that wants to work..... it’s basically all what u make it... I have good days and some times I have bad days
bad,Horrible pay. I luckily had a fantastic store manager who was willing to work with you on hours and availability. However that is extremely rare. With low staffing you'd be lucky to get your paid time off.
bad,Making sure everything was facing and getting everything cleaned up. Talking to the customers and the people that I worked with. Everyone works hard and gets what they are told to do done before moving on to the next thing. Also keeping eyes on the counter to make sure the customers are taking care of.
bad,"My old Store  was one of the best in the company but support was weak. co-worker were above avg new store lacked support with upto 6 different mgrs in 2 years ,, no security, etc,, enough said.."
bad,"Just got a new store manager, and she is great! She maintains her cool, even though she's exhausted from practically living in store due to lack of employees. When I got hired I was curious as to why there was such a shortage of team members for our store, and then I started to realize. The pay rate is a hit beneath the waist as it is, for the amount of work you are expected to do. (and I'm all about working, but I also feel it proper to be compensated fairly for a person's time and hard work). But then they don't even pay you what they owe! Either you get paid at a lesser amount than hired in at, your check will be missing hours, or they get you in some other way that shorts you, and benefits them. Another injustice I feel is a solid employee that was a genuine asset for the store, who managed to stock and do his job while he would go the extra step with the customers, was wrongfully terminated for false accusations. Be it in a small conversation about the weather, a discussion over quality of a product or item, or just anything really, he had an ora that always made the customers receive a warm and attentive experience. Each and every one. Unfortunately, the company itself is mostly disorganized and unrealistic with expectations of their employees. And either payroll or upper management needs reevaluated in order to bring the standards up a bit in quality and accuracy to ensure the employees are properly paid, and even shown a little mutual respect as part of the team."
bad,"too much work is expected of one person. unbox stuff. stock stuff. rotate merchandise. straighten it all too. find something in the wrong place? go put it back. hope you have every single product in the entire store memorized! but wait someone's at the register.. run back! but wait, they're complaining they didnt get half off their t-shirt. you better have the sale memorized because now you have to explain why they didn't get it. check them out. run back to what you were doing. what were you doing? doesnt matter, someone's at the register. run back. check them out. out of no where 3 people get in line. you only get through one when blam! they hit you with that ""im returning something"". go get the manager. where's the manager? manager returns item. sign the receipt. stick it in your drawer. help the next customer. help the next customer. help the next customer. someone walks in.. where's the jolly ranchers? think.. which candy aisle is it in. just point them to a random one there's no time! 4 people just showed up at the register. hours later none of the work you needed to get done is done. barely stocked. barely cleaned. but you worked so hard!"
bad,The pay is too little for the amount of work you have to put in with this company. I have had a pay raise waiting for corporate to pass since January and it's now the end of May.
bad,"There is a reason why Dollar General has high turnover for Store Managers, District Managers, and Regional Directors.  It is the disconnection of what they tell you they want for their associates and what is actually expected from their associates.  Executives state they want good work/life balance for their management teams.  However the expectation to work 6-7 days a week is real.  We are overloaded with stores/responsibilities and more stores are on the way with even more tasks assigned weekly.  Stores have shopping hours that don't actually meet customer traffic flows.  Store staffing matrixes are so tight that Store Managers are alone for sometimes 8 hours a day.  HR policies specifically within the Employee Relations Department are such that many associates are often rehired after termination without regard for the situation or ramifications upon the Store Manager/ District Manager.  This undermines the management team."
bad,"Store managers must work a minimum of 5.5 days and 48 hours per week. There is almost no quality family time because when you are home, you're exhausted."
bad,At dollor general there is always room for advancment if you want it. I chose to not try to move up after spending time in the company. It is a stable job as long as you show up on time.
bad,"Low stress "
bad,Customers were often rude and disrespectful. I was often scheduled alone and during times I asked not to be scheduled. I would often have to close the store and then open the next day.
bad,what can i say this job was pretty laid back you could use your phone to play music while working you just clock in and do your job everybody minds they business
bad,Solid and stable company with a successful track record.  Workload is very intense at all levels.  Work/life balance is difficult. I believe some of the challenges/shortfalls are due to the company's explosive growth rate.
bad,Dollar General does not protect its employees. They allow their superiors to bully and retaliate and ignore serious company policy violations. I was wrongfully terminated after my direct supervisor admitted and was documented for retaliation
bad,The workers and in-store management are good people but corporate controls almost everything. You're lucky to get 25+ hours per week and all employees are at state minimum wage except for the store manager who is salaried.
bad,"When I first started it was great, then things change. The DM change to some one else and everything went down hill . She mostly got rid of everyone that had work for old DM at any cost"
bad,I loved working there at the start but when the new manager came in she ran alot of people out of there. she would not talk to u in private she always did it in front of everyone.
bad,"I have worked for this company for many, many years."
bad,"assistant. manager. or key holder, unable to treat you with respect.She was very rude. She made example of you, when you made a mistake right in front of customers."
bad,Job was very demanding and most of the time you had to be doing all the work. Not enough staff to maintain store to standards. I learned a lot by trial and error. They do not train you long enough and you are thrown in to your job to figure it out on your own. The hardest part of the job is not having a work and family balance. I enjoyed my job when I was able to make my customers happy and see how I had changed the store to company standards. I would not work there again or recommend any one too.
bad,"Dollar  General needs to have more respect for their employes. They are are alwys going throuh mangers., They always  have emplyees quit and I feel like they do not respect their employes"
bad,"Dollar General was pretty easy for a while, and the managers were very nice. The shifts were usually opening to noon, or noon to close, so lots of hours. The store was kind of messy, and it felt crowded even when nobody was there. A lot of the registers or electronics didn't work, so it kinda felt like a Mom 'n Pop store."
bad,"Summary says it all. It is a retail job, meeting all expectations one could expect."
bad,"I hated working here. The facility where I worked had a fast turn over rate, they never could keep employees. Work could be very stressful due to it being the only real grocery type store in the town. I learned a lot about customer service working there though. It was nice being able to go home for lunch and be able to take paid small breaks every now and then."
bad,"Work 10 to 12 hours a day. If associates called in, no one else would cover as the manager you are required to cover that shift doesn't matter how many hours you had already work. Trying to keep store neat, clean and organized with very limited hours to work with. Job can be very stressful."
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers and manager (after the first) but corporate makes the work life in the field more difficult than it has to be. This is my experience after over two years of working there, and being promoted to Assistant Manager. I've spoken to multiple employees from other stores, and they all have the same outlook I do on this company."
bad,"Great pay, but customers are not polite and aren't considerate you have to help all not only one person . Co workers are great to work with and have fun . Lunch break is about 30 mins no more or no less. The work hours aren't really ""flexible"" with school schedule because they still think you can work after school hours . But can't because you have other priorities other than work , like helping take siblings to school and from home."
bad,"You work a lot of last minute overtime. There is no set work schedule. I was told when I got hired that my schedule would be from 6am to 2pm, I have not worked that schedule since I have been there."
bad,Good for a starting job but does not pay enough for everything required of you in the long run. Do not highly recommend it. Have to deal with difficult customers often.
bad,"A typical day at dollar general was stress-full. From the moment you arrived until the moment you left it was nonstop busy. That would not have been a problem had it not been for the outdated cash registers they refused to update. There were constant issue when it came to using debit and credit cards and we often had to put up signs saying ""cash only"" until the issue was resolved. Which was not always within the day. This, along with the terribly rude customers and the gossipy coworkers, and poor pay created a terrible work enviroment. I would not recommend this job."
bad,"On a day to day basis for the most part, I enjoyed my job at Dollar General. I had issues with Management attempting to make me work mandatory extra hours even when I would explain to them why I couldn't."
bad,"Too much to accomplish in a given shift for the amount of staff available. Stressful and not a worthwhile place to work. Poor pay, no benefits, and an inconsistent work schedule all made the job worse"
bad,"A typical shift had two workers, with only one at the register. The sales associates are expected to run the register, stock, and assist customers all at once. There are often long lines. Customers become impatient and irritated knowing that there is only one register open, despite there being other employees working. The hardest part is trying to get all of your side work (recovery, stocking, etc.) done when you have a constant flow of customers. I'd imagine with a less busy store, these issues would not be present though."
bad,"Stressful because very few workers so minimal breaks.  Very low pay.  The manager is great and does everything possible to help out, but hugely over worked"
bad,this company is poorly managed and the open door policy is pretty much a set up for them terminating you.  If you know someone who is in a hire pay grade then you and you are friends you are pretty much guaranteed a job.  I loved my customers and always being busy but they expect too much and it is never enough.  not enough help to get what needs to be done done.  I remember working long shifts with no breaks and always having to cover for someone else but when I needed coverage it became a problem.  I do not recommend working here management is immature and do not care about their employees and they terminate you when you call them out on their own mistakes.
bad,I started working  when the Bethel warehouse opened up and since then I saw all my supervisors quit and last year 847 employees leave. Stay away from that place.
bad,Dollar General is a good place to work if you have the intellect and social skills to be a good stockworker and cashier. I had a good experience working there
bad,"You definitely kept busy and the customers were pretty cool, I didn't really have a hard time with them. The management cold of been better though. Also the co workers were ok."
bad,"Very easy job, however it was very very boring. None of the staff seemed to want to interact with one another and they all looked miserable. Most of the time I was there the staff always talked bad about management ."
bad,I loved my job but things got out of hand and people stared to quit and leave. I had a very easy job I was a cashier. My job was to first make sure my customers had the products they came to get. I also had to sweep and mop the floors and clean the restrooms.
bad,Faced paced job and there is constant lifting of some heavy product.managers are quick to write you up if you can't hit your percentage.good pay but sometimes not you won't get your 40hrs per week.
bad,Would not recommend joining the Dollar Genera team.  Upper management  only cares about the mighty dollar not about employee safety.Most stores are understaffed due to lack of hour.
bad,As a manager you could easily work 70 hours per week and I wouldn't mind that if it wasn't every week.  You are not allowed to hire sufficient help so you are responsible for filling in the gaps by working additional hours.
bad,"The hours are not right. from 2-11pm theres your whole day. the store manager was rude to customers, yelled at employees in front of customers, always mad."
bad,"When I first started working there, I enjoyed the job so much. My manager at the time noticed and talked to me about being promoted to cashier. However, shortly before that opportunity would arise, she had to be replaced by another manager. The new manager took all my good hours away and gave it to her ""favorites"" from where she used to work... It was ridiculous having to drive 20 miles once a week for only 4 hours, so I quit."
bad,A typical day at work was unpredictable and yet gratifying. The customers were appreciative however the payroll and staffing was a huge issue because of the companies limitations.
bad,"The manager drilled tasks hard core into us each day. Some days pushing past our max. Since leaving , that store has gone down hill, It no longer contains a core value."
bad,"Manager was disrespectful and unprofessional to employees and customers. However, the job itself was okay and productive. It was not a diverse workplace."
bad,The pay is horrible for all of the things you have to do. There should be a higher minimum wage for this job. The management was great they are not tideous like some jobs
bad,Dollar General is and ok place to work but is highly recommended as a part time you can not live off your earnings as a associate for the company management needs to put forth a little more traing
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the best job I had was proving to my employer I was a dedicated employee and would go to the limits to make his job easier. I also, loved making our customers happy."
bad,Company management requires a lot of hours out of salary employees and do not allow enough labor hours for hourly employees to complete required tasks.
bad,this is a nice job for high school students or those looking for a job while in college to make a little money. not a lot of room for growth or advancement. overall an okay job
bad,"Too much drama, employees are in other employees personsl business. Everyone talks about each other behind their backs and it is a very unorganized place. Some of the assistant managers and employees depend on other employees to do their job."
bad,Its a good job to work at. The customers was always friendly and happy.I enjoyed working with my team at work.Its a fun place to work for very productive.
bad,The work load versus the pay rate was not balanced and more often than not I found myself feeling taken advantage of and stretched thin by my superiors.
bad,"It was not a very friendly environment "
bad,By far the most stressful job I have ever had. Store managers are completely overworked and corporate doesn't care. People quite left and right because compensation and benefits are no where near suitable for the workload.
bad,"Get to work 15 minutes before opening, get tills ready for the day. Open the store and help customers. Stock shelves and check in vendors when not helping customers. When evening Staff comes in they help customers and recovery store while cashiering, clean store, breakroom,restrooms, prepare deposit and mop in the last 15 minutes"
bad,"Your held under a payroll that is so low you have to work the store all alone to keep the payroll where it should be your vacation get turn into cover overage on payroll "
bad,The one thing that bothered me. Is there was a deceased animal outside and with grown men working with me they made me pick it up. They wouldn't hire a company to do it. I ended up puking at the side of the store. I also had to mop the whole store as everybody watched me doing it. I felt like people were lazy and made me do the most difficult work.
bad,"Some days (especially around the holidays) were chaotic. Most customers were regulars/return customers, and they were AWESOME people. Management was great, co-workers too, loved everybody and that's how I made it here so long! (Face it, DG has a high turnover rate). Had a bit of a stretch towards the end with unreliable co-workers and I was always called in to take their place (another example of when you show loyalty, a company will utilize the HECK out of you. Pay was minimum wage, but it's retail lol"
bad,"The hours and Pay is not enough to live on, as a sales associate. They hired me on at 15 hours a week and $7.50 hr. It did not seem that business feels the workers are just that workers and not one of the vital points of their business. I only worked a couple of hours there and was offered a job with better hours and better pay."
bad,"* you never knew what you were coming into that day"
bad,Dollar was great as ii say so many times :D. I learned how to greet customer and welcome them into the store always. I most enjoyable part bout this jobs was asking the customer did they need help finding something or etc....
bad,"A typical day would consist of me coming in and working the cash register with no help no matter how long the lines got. I learned that when your working you cant rely on somebody else's help even if the situation isn't your fault. Management was great, they where really down to earth and I wasn't afraid to ask simple questions. The hardest part was people with coupons that didn't work."
bad,It paid pretty good. The people there was nice to work with. You could work all the over time you wanted. You could play air hocky on break and also ping pong.
bad,The pay for me was terrible. They gave me $7.50 an hour and i worked for four hours. Usually i would stock the shelves but when someone can't come in for work i had to run the register.
bad,This could be a fantastic company to work for but higher management doesn't allow for great productivity with the limited employment hours and payroll limitations.
bad,"Dollar General has upper management issue's. We lost 4 manager's and a District manager with in one year of working for this company. I learned everything I know from the first two manager's I had the honor to work for. My co-workers were the best. I had an excellent team working under me. We just had no leadership going on above us. So, we were forced to run the store blindly for over 6 months. The hardest part of my job was the location of this business. We suffered hourly with theft issue's and assault issue's on our employee's, as well as; our customer's. The best part of my job was my customer's, no matter what they were always there for me. Always putting a smile on my face and making me want to work for them even harder!"
bad,I took over a fix it store and took it to a 25% sales increase over the  last  year!! However there was no DM at the time to give support for issues I needed help with!  It was I was a ship dead in the water!!
bad,Productive and fun workplace with great management. Just was enough hours available to work for decent pay. Other than that a cool place to work.
bad,"Boring, repetitive, and managers don't help you out when you have a line of 10 people. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"fun working place if you was working with the right people on the shift you was working on. the hardest part of the day was when customers would come in with complants, the enjoyable part was being able to help customers out when they needed help, and by the end of the day the store looked as great and ready for the next day, everything in its place."
bad,"Was not the most organized place to work, but it was a new store and workers. Workers didn't have much experience working in that kind of store."
bad,"You will not find out what your schedule will be like until the day before, management expects you to do EVERYTHING for low pay."
bad,"management was not true to its job tittle, they did what they wanted to do, such as leave on the clock to attend doctor appointments."
bad,This job is only if you never had any job experience coming out of high school other than that stay away from this place. The customers were all over the place our particular location got the cops called because of a crazy person the place had gotten robbed when it was first built. Then the worst of all people would come in 5 minutes before the store close to buy things everyday that is annoying.
bad,A place where I met a lot of diversity of people. It was a fun  place to work and where I learned more manager skills. I was a quick learner so there for I was able to gain more duties and responsibility.
bad,I love the work. Very redundant and doesn't take much thinking to do but very fast paced and hours pass by quickly. My feet never could adjust to the environment however. Moving very quickly in order to keep percentage high. Never new how long shift was until the meeting before shift started each day. Management was good and never had any personal confrontationstatement with them although some coworkers have. Pay is good. But when telling staff about long hours they emphasize the money part. I mean I know no one works for free but consistently paints a picture of all this money which somehow should overshadow the fact you never get to see your family. Hours were the thing that caused me to leave. Seeing my family far out weighs any amount of money offered. High turnover rate.
bad,"Work day was always stressful... Poor team members"
bad,it is a decent experience. I enjoyed working with different customers. I enjoyed making sure they were satisfied with their purchases and customer service.
bad,"I left for personal reasons, but it was an alright job. It was a good hold over for the time I was there. It wasn't as friendly to me as it was to others"
bad,Innovative customer service skills. The ability to listen closely to customers.Clear verbal communication which effectively executes and process changes to improve operation efficiency.Results that's needed with diverse background in management and customer service.Dedicated to providing excellect customer service and making operational and procedural improvement. High-powered customer service with a can-do attitude and willingness to help at all times.
bad,"My days at Dollar General were always busy. I was always on my feet four times a week. The hours were not all that great but I still got to work around great people. I've learned a lot working at Dollar General. I learned how to count money correctly, and also learned how to work the cash registers correctly. The management at Dollar General was pretty reasonable; she worked well with you to make sure you were comfortable with whatever it was you were doing. The co workers there were very helpful too. They were there for you the moment you were in trouble with something. The hardest part was dealing with rude everyday customers. Because you can really say anything negative back to them. So I would just look back at them and smile. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with new people and getting to know them."
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General was helping the customers with their purchases. Cleaning the store. Stocking the merchandise. Putting the product on the shelf. I learned better public relation skills through my customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, were the customers. I enjoyed meeting new co-workers."
bad,"You can be told anytime (you must clock out now, were cutting hours). or someone will text you and say (Don't come in today)."
bad,typical day was getting front end reay with registers and then opening store and waiting on customers... in between did the stocking of shelves.
bad,In a typical day there is far more tasks to be completed than time allows for. This requires staff to become very efficient at multitasking and establishing priorities. Upper Management and the corporate standard operations did not help lower management to quickly resolve issues that arise. This causes stress for staff and when combined with the heavy workload co-workers begin to blame each other for tasks that did not get done.
bad,"OPening and closing of the store, managing the employees, customer service and relations, returns, vendors, stocking, emails, end of day reports, banking, cleaning and stocking"
bad,"Schedules never consistent, required to be posted at least two days in advance, but sometimes wouldn't be posted until halfway through the week. Good pay and benefits for the work, speaking for non-salary employees. Great job security and advancement due to high turnover rates. Employees are always leaving, therefore the company keeps the ones who will stay as long as they aren't thieves. Horrible management from store level to district level to regional level, and most likely beyond. Okay job culture, but seems that not many strive to follow."
bad,"Work was flexible and close, but the hours were minimal and crew was understaffed."
bad,"I am at the register, and have a great ability to relate to our customers, and also store recovery. I am the top employee in our our charity donations. All of my co-workers and I get along great, and have an enjoyable time while also completing all of our work. The hardest part of my job is keeping all of our items stocked, and makes it difficult to make sure customers get the best experience we strive for. What I enjoy most is making our customer's day and having them leave with every item they need and a smile on their face."
bad,"A typical day at work includes a lot of stocking, taking in vendors and  doing planograms according to the MAG. you may or may not do returns and or exchanges and it's always your job to keep the store fully recovered and clean. I've learned to be patient with people. You never know what someone is going through. My co-workers are the best part of my job. There really isn't anything hard about this job. The most unpleasant part of my job is the swing shift. I really don't like being away from my children at night. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers. I enjoy being around people and interacting with many walks of life."
bad,"Handling of customers, money, unloading of truck. Unobtainable goal for freight handling."
bad,The people were great but you will work your butt off for minimum wage....
bad,Typical day would start by getting called to come in earlier due to not having enough employees'.  It was a lot of stocking shelves and running cash register.  While there learned to submit payroll a operate a cctv.  Hardest part of this job maintaining employees' not many people actually wanted to work.  Most enjoyable part were the awesome customers.
bad,This job was an okay job. Great for the experience being able to work with members as a team.
bad,"I really enjoyed being of service to the company by dealing with the changing paced days and customers, but I really couldn't stand being usually held passed my hours, people constantly disappearing and leaving me with there share of the work and mostly things that I was paid or able to handle because of lack of training such as returns. I didn't like that some particular customers, and too at times employees come with (weed) smell or tried to make me look foolish when I had a line in front of me to deal with. I didn't like the disorganization of the store, but they too were fixing or in the process of store change so I didn't really see how things would have been easier had I not been tested so often to go retrieve things that was out of my area, not have an intercom to call on other employees so I have to page them with the store phone which too would be left on shelves. I did despite all that has been said learn and enjoy that if I show my true loving nature people see that a place can be somewhat a home or caring environment away from home, but maybe to not take on more than I can handle. I learned how strong-willed and preserving I am, but how each member too has a role to play in a business."
bad,good nice easy going had a lot of ot and they will work with you 
bad,Not a place for someone to work if you are trying to continue your education. Not very flexible with your schedule. (depends on management). Your top off pay is 10 unless you are a manager. 
bad,"Was a ok place to work at. Typical retail type business. You will stock, run the register, clean, ect. The manager I had was great but she was also a personal friend. "
bad,"At Dollar General, I never really knew what I was going to encounter on a day by day basis. Some days I would effectively be the manager on duty and do everything from merchandise returns to setting up new displays. They had offered me a 'key' position on multiple occasions but I was a full time student and could not put in the time necessary to effectively manage the role. On weeknights, I would mainly walk through the store and arrange the shelves so that they would look presentable for the next business day. I would also sweep the flows and mop as well. On Friday mornings, I would arrive early in the day to help receive product off the truck and get it onto the shelves as well. "
bad,"This was one of my first real jobs. It helped me develope customer service skills, people skills and responsibility. It was a great experience."
bad,A typical day consist of stocking and running a register. Some of the managers where a+ then you would find some that could care less about you. Loves my co workers and my customers. A very good company to work for but no family time.
bad,"I wanted to work myself up in the company and train for Management, but the more I showed the Manager I could handle the job, the more he asked me to do, the less he showed appreciation, and he wouldn't up the pay with the more responsible he gave. So I decided that I was better then that and I deserved more, so I left"
bad,"I have been here for 3-1/2 years as a cashier and I have watched many people come and go. 3 different times I was passed up for promotion; one of them being a girl fresh out of high school who later came up positive for crank. To replace her, the store manager immediately promoted another girl who hasn't even been at the company for 2 months. She too looks like she might be a crackhead."
bad,this job you had to work with people on a face to face basis. You has to understand the needs of your customers
bad,"I usually work at the register. I also stock shelves on the weekend. I clean the bathrooms, mop the floors, and sweep the floors. All the co-workers were very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,They hire managers that are not fit for the job. When complaints are made to corp office by staff and customers in reference to the manager nothing is done about it.
bad,Enjoy the duties of the job as being a store manager but didn't enjoy the way the day to day was scheduled.
bad,"Good company overall really have an opportunity to advance as they are expanding often. I was happy with the company and feel good about the opportunity. You work alone which has good and bad, but overall happy with the company."
bad,"The job itself wasn’t hard at all. Kept me busy. My coworkers at the time were very shady, untrustworthy, and many times was found talking to the manager about one another. Lots of drama!"
bad,"Low Pay, Manager and ASM do most of work while trying to get your MOD's to do anything hard. DG over sends items that have no where to be placed.  Stores become so over shipped with unwanted items.  DM is clueless and uses his Management staff"
bad,"The kind of work what I did was good, just is too much to do for one employee. I had a really nice manager and I learned a lot about retail, but we always were short of people and short of hours to give to the employees and it is frustrated sometimes."
bad,Being pregnant and they don’t care about how they work you and will try to put you in early labor. High management is very irresponsible about employees health
bad,"If you're a student don't do it, you can and will find something better. This is one selfish company the one I worked at in Ga. For you and your kids safety don't work there please. Its also stressing ang the management is selfish and only cares about herself. THE DOLLAR GENERAL IN GA, I cant speak on no other DG. Good pay tho but is your health is more important them money, keep that in mind. Don't stress over a job that's going to replace you once something goes wrong with you."
bad,"The company is all about making money. They will only pay for one cashier, you can call for someone to come help you but they don't like too, only call for someone when you have like 5 people in your line, they want you to do the jobs of like 3 people at one time, the pay is not fair for the work you do"
bad,"cool place to work needed more co-workers! loved the busy store of the store, I was always busy. only thing was someone of the venders would leave trash."
bad,"Short breaks for such long hours of work from 6am to 4pm Monday thru Friday. Poor management ,they over work you, bad training skills, bad attitudes, poor teamwork."
bad,I had a hard manager to work under. She wasn’t the nicest person. She would get upset for being sick and taking days off. She would give less hours when she wanted more. One manager was friendly but the store manager was very difficult. I quit to avoid being fired for being sick.
bad,"Friendly relaxed environment. I learned how to run a cash register in today's time, using the DG app, online coupons and sales. Management is ok, work schedule is inconsistent, you might work all weekends for a while, then every other day for weeks. With tendency to change the schedule without notice. Minimum wage. Part time houre are 5.5 hour shifts and 6 hour shifts 5 days a week."
bad,Not enough hours will give job advancement to someone that been there longer even though you worker harder and know the job better. 4 hours a day will need 2 jobs because your check looks like nothing after taxes
bad,"The manager we had at Dollar General was very rude. Not only to me but the customer's also! "
bad,"If the general manager would have been a manager instead of a jealous nut case Dollar General could have been the place for me to retire from. "
bad,"Really stressful at times, only reason I stayed was because we get paid weekly and my co-workers. The district manager is pushy and expects more then what can be done, she also picks favorites. Doesn't actually get to know you as a person. Months ago I was supposed to be making more then what I am now, but she never approved my raise and I've been working there 2 years plus, only making $9 an hour, 30 hours+ a week, as a key holder. I really do enjoy my store manager and co-workers though. They make it worth it. "
bad,"You have to be Able to deal with difficult customers everyday, if their digital coupons do not work be prepared to call a manager. ALWAYS ID FOR ANYTHING PROMPTED TO ID FOR (customers telling your their birth date is not enough), NO MATTER WHAT. Always be positive even when the customers are unruly. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Remember that teamwork makes the dream work. Pay may be garbage but the experience is worth it if you stick around."
bad,Its definently not career worthy unless u plan to become store manager. I only reccomend this job to students trying to get through college or needing out of the house.
bad,"no communication at all and no one showed up on time ,i was always the one up at the register by myself while everyone ""stocked shelves"". never going back"
bad,You can quickly climb the ladder at Dollar General but the pay is terrible. An assistant manager only makes $9.63 an hour. Would not recommend for a long term job.
bad,"The craziest place i've worked at, don't get paid much and they don't really care for your safety always changing management. Will hire just about anyone."
bad,Do not become a store manager. They put too much stress on getting everything done with no hours to do it. You dont get enough hours to schedule help and your by yourself alot not able to get things done. If someone calls off you have to cover it because 9X out of 10 no one will work it for you. Alot of double shifts.
bad,"It's ok but as a loader you can't move up,selectors move up quicker cause the have about  50 to 60 selectors and loaders are less then 10. They work the loaders like slaves!!!"
bad,"The coworkers were kind and willing to help. The overall environment was very slow-paced and non-stimulating. The location that I was at did not feel safe, and I did not feel comfortable there."
bad,Productive workplace. Just to much to do with not enough hours or people. Some of the people I work with don’t like to work and are very rude. I really need to find something better for me.
bad,Turn over rate is absolutely insane. The cooperate office is a bunch of crooked fools. I would never go back and work for DG if my life depended on it. As a manager you are extremely over worked. You don’t get compensated for OT ever if you have worked 60 hours that week. You work a min of 48 hours a week 6 days a week. Good luck fitting in a break.
bad,"Coworkers were enjoyable to work with, but machines are outdated or sometimes will not work properly. Shopping carts need replaced and several aisles are disorganized due to lack of care from customers. Responsibilities require you to stock shelves while simultaneously assisting customers and/or operating the main register, which hinders production. Schedule was fairly flexible and managers provided much assistance when needed. Fairly unremarkable experience."
bad,"This job can be stressful, you will never get a full-time position,and you are paid minimum wage. Most enjoyable part is the fact you get enough time to yourself."
bad,You dont get paid enough to do what they expect. You cant complain to higher ups or your hours get cut. Not a good work environment at all. I was there for 3 yrs missed 2 days and eventually ended up being screwed by my DM
bad,"I was thrown into an area by myself after being there for a month, I was set up to fail from day one.  Training was terrible, Micro Managers, and company policies were not followed for all."
bad,"When I first started with the company there was an excitement I have with all new ventures I put my heart and soul into. I have always been in management at my previous jobs but, Dollar General was the first company where the Store Manager basically did what he/she wanted. I did come to learn that this behavior seemed to only be followed within some stores including ours. The work culture was poor when I first started but improved with my leadership and by leading by example. I have been in the retail industry for 20+ years and have the confidence to be a District and or Regional Manager. There were so many ways that we could have improved sales, service to our customers, and raise the bar in terms of how a store should run. "
bad,management is decent but overall benefits and pay are not worth making a career out of dollar general inconsistant hours. Hardest part of the job is pleasing every customer that came through the door
bad,"There are other jobs. Don't do it. It's a life wasting job and you never see your family if you do work as a SM. Hope.you have a great team like I did. We all worked great together and enjoyed our time working. But outside of it all, it's not worth it."
bad,"Dollar General does not give it's stores enough hours to get everything done."
bad,"I liked the people that I worked with, but at some point the customer demand took over and we were not able to get caught up on the weekly truck load, which meant we were never able to get accurate counts of inventory and items would ship when we didn't need more, and items we did need never showed up. No time to check dates and product is frequently found expired and must be damaged out, only to have more arrive that we don't have time to stock and date. High theft area but we lack bodies and hours and cameras, thus items frequently walk out the door and there is nothing we can do about it. High customer volume with one cashier to run the store for hours at time and it's asked why nothing gets accomplished in terms of stocking and cleaning. Assistant Store Manager makes $12/hr to deal with this level of insanity? Store manager needs to dedicate 50+ hours a week to store simply to maintain it."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job at Dollar General when I was offering customer service, but you are left alone for many of your shifts and are expected to wait on customers, stock shelves, clean, etc.  It is hard to do when the store is busy with customers.  Also I feel it is dangerous to be left alone especially to close at night."
bad,They will work you like a slave that doesn’t match the pay!!!  You don’t get any employee discounts at the store. You either get good hours or no hours there’s no in between this job requires a lot of work believe it or not
bad,Specifically speaking on Dollar General located in Great Falls. The store is very busy almost at all times. Poor management & favoritism shown between employees
bad,Overall my experience at dollar general was average. i wouldn't say it was terrible  however the management at  that time was definitely not a pleasant representation of the company.
bad,It could be better! Better pay for the employees and maybe a bigger store as well! The company is worth money and should think more about the people working I don't care if you are part time. You should have benefits as well for part time.
bad,"was not impressed with management. was unfairly let go. was a learning opportunity. I did learn the basics of the regester, and how to approtch customers the right way"
bad,Dollar general was a nice and productive work place but it was just some of the workers that was working  there they would be gone on break pass there 30 minutes no helping others when needed
bad,its hard to get stocking and other task done when busy. sometimes it can be boring when there is no customers.but there is always some to do. being a cashier is ok
bad,The job became a pencil pushing position that was basically taking the time away from stocking and customer service. There were a lot of weeks that I worked 65 hours or more
bad,Dollar general is ok but not enough hours the work is boring and the pay is way less then the cost of living. The customers that come in are very friendly the employment staff was very polite
bad,"As a manager you are required to work 50+ hours to keep your store where it needs to be, absolutely not worth the money. You literally live there, if you want the bonuses and the incentives you have to be there to keep everything up and running.  This company doesn't pay its assistants enough for them to actually invest in the company, so you have to pick up the slack no matter what the case is."
bad,"They're were days that were very enjoyable. If we would've had a good, decent, hard working team then this would've been a great job. I had a manager who didn't want to work, didn't want to cover call offs, would not answer the phone when a cashier would call off which often left me working til close on Saturday at 10:30 on a truck day then back in Sunday morning at 6am to stock and the Sunday cashier would call off 90% of the time which then would leave me alone til 2pm when the next key holder came in and I'd have to stay til close at 1030. Often worked 14 hr days. The key to great enjoyable job is having a hard working team behind you and that starts at the top with the manager or even the district manager."
bad,"A typical day is greeting customers, assisting them with selection of merchandise, handling transactions at the cash register, and keeping store orderly and clean."
bad,the manager is not a good manager. she never gave her employees any breaks. she refused to help on register. she always critized the other co workers.
bad,"You will be working nonstop the entire day- freight, recovery, cash register. there will be LOTS of robberies. everyday you will do the same thing. Freight, Cash register, recovery, cleaning, and counting money"
bad,long hours and heavy lifting.. mentally and physically draining. People were very friendly there! You have to be able to have good hearing so you can listen to a headset and have the ability to bend up and down at a fast pace
bad,Sometimes it was fun to work there the customers where great and nice to work for then other times the management was sometime rude and didn't care that much about other team members and they give no benefits or days off  even if i asked they wouldnt do it for me
bad,They didn't have enough employees when someone called off. You would have to work the other persons shift. 
bad,"overall the work environment was stressful because higher management made it stressful.  it wasn't a hard job, but they expected you to get 10 hrs of work cut into 3 hrs of work and expected it to be as good as it would be if you had the time needed for the task."
bad,I opened and closed after being offered the job as MOD. I also had to check in trucks and vendors. Working with customers was awesome. At the time of my employment I was working with some awesome girls in management and loved every day. After a little while we had to have new manager because of issues that were unsolved. Then it was pure nightmares working with other stores management until we made a score high enough to hire our own store manager.
bad,"Management was unorganized, was really cold in the winter and very hot in the summer but now from what i her its a lot better with tempa ture wise. And the pay is a lot better now."
bad,"you will never get paid what your worth and if you compare how many hours you work vs. you salary you soon learn you don,t make much money also you have to help run other stores because there is such a high turn over rate in these stores. its common for a store manager to have to run two r more stores but not get paid anything extra for that"
bad,"I liked all of the other employees; however, the store that I worked at had a terrible theft problem. Also, the previous employees were so backed up that we had to call in other employees from other stores to come help us restock and recover our store completely. I did not intend to leave because I really needed a job but circumstances caused me to have to leave suddenly. The manager was sweet as can be and she enjoyed her job. She wanted to see everything through but at the time I left after 4 months of being there, we still were no where near being done. The tasks we had should have been done within a month."
bad,It was a very fast paced joj. people always called off. Your constantly on the go. Many times i would have to work through a break just to get things done. They do have good benefits and a 401k though and paid vacations witch was nice.
bad,I liked working for Dollar General. Mostly cashiering and stocking all day. Slow pace environment which made the day go by slow. Management was awesome!
bad,a good place to start your career work at or a part time job for school or more income ... very stressful and fast paced and you have to be a very detailed person and all
bad,Came and clocked in.  Got a drawer and had it counted out.  And then started my shift.  Its usual that it was only two people were there.  One was usually stocking and the other would be running back forth from the register to do put backs or stock.
bad,Your not giving the 90 day period to get accuracy on picking and your productivity to a 100% before they start having you sign productivity progress which makes you a nervous wreck and interfere with reaching productivity.
bad,Overall i loved my job. The last few months they made major changes and lost a lot of long time managers. I worked there for 7 years and it onlu got to the breaking point in the last 6 months and in my district alone the turn over rate was so high we had no one to cover all the shifts needed and managers were working 70 80 hours a week.
bad,"It was fine until I got a new manager. I had to come in 7 days a week for 10 hours at a time as an assistant manager. It got so bad, I ended up overworking myself and fell ill."
bad,"Get payed 7.25 an hour . not good money at all weekly pay , stocking during few hours you work , managers can be hard to work with some nights , loved the customers ."
bad,"The managers and other staff are great, but corporate adds a lot of stress. Lots of turnover, they expect a very small staff to complete work that would require four times as many people"
bad,"Over time, they will require fewer and fewer employees to do the same amount of work as many. The people are great from the manager downward, but corporate chases the bottom line"
bad,"Working at Dollar General typical day. "
bad,"It started out as an excellent job it was very nice and resourceful for the community, then it became a very toxic area and enviroment to pursue in causing me to leave"
bad,You don't have any time for your family.work 6 days a week.it can be a dangerous place to work for at times.the company does not pay enough for the amount of work involved
bad,"responsibilities include ringing out customers, mechanizing the store, cleaning the store when closing, setting up the store when opening, the job itself is relatively laid back with few responsibilities."
bad,Helps customers. Responsible for stocking products. Too much is expected of Sales Clerks and other employees. The company cuts costs at every corner and leaves associates stressed and under-paid.
bad,"It's hard to balance working the cash register and to focus on putting stock away on shelves. Depends on the location on how customers are. If it's a small team then it's easy to rack up hours, but low pay."
bad,So much to do with not enough hours given to do it. They only offer enough hours to house two employees per shift. Just overall to much work and not enough pay
bad,At Dollar General I loved being a sales associate/cashier. I stocked the front of the store and ran the cashier. Dollar General just don't give enough hours I was only working 6 hours a day.
bad,I liked working  here I love working with the customers  and I liked my coworkers as well I like to help people  no material if it's at work or at home
bad,"I used to work as a stocker at the DG in the Oaks, it was ok. Then new management came in an was letting people go. Word was the management at the time was trying to bring his friends in to work there who knows."
bad,Dollar general is a fast paced company with a very high turn over rate because they simply mistreat their employees new hires especially and there is no verbal communication with this company
bad,"people were very helpful when I first started, but the longer I worked there and they changed owners the worst the company got. Had to take days off without pay"
bad,Working in a very urban community is very dangerous. People steal all the time and they threaten staff lives.  Trying to stop them (verbally) makes you a target to get assaulted. The police takes 20 mins to come. Upper management does nothing because they are not actually in the stores. It doesn't effect them so they could care less.They need to have security at this stores for staff protection. I never been so afraid to go to work in my life. Everyday I pray to make it own safe to my family
bad,You must lift large objects and stand 8 hours a day or more for a little amount of money it is quite possibly the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,It was okay not what I expected told to do one thing but they got mad when I would do what my assistant manager told me what me to do when the original  said otherwise
bad,"Worked with the company for six months and upper management visited three times. Went in to a broken store and left with a pretty decent store, however, "
bad,"I recently got hired as a full time key carrier and was happy with my job. one i forgot to put the cash from the register back in the safe. I had forgot it in the office. Nothing had gotten stolen overnight. the next night that I closed with the same employee I was closing the store and forgot the salt bags on the u-boat overnight nothing got stolen yet again. I did not notice they were not brought in the employee that I had closed with could have brought them in while I had closed the store and work as a team. If i had noticed they were still outside i would have brought them inside. My manager had a word with me in the office about it and said she couldn't take it anymore and had to let me go. I was never told about a warning if it ever happened again id get fired or anything she just let me go instead. There was a day the store manager herself had left her keys at the store overnight and needed me to let her inside the store so she could open. wow the store manager is suppose to have the keys on the them at all times I thought guess not the manager can make mistakes and never have to worry about getting fired but they sure can let you get fired first. bogus job! This store was 900 RT 121 Mt. Zion,IL. The only best part of the job was the customers! awesome people"
bad,This corporation does not treat employees decently. They much refer to us as cattle and will treat you as such. $8.25 an hour as a manager is very under paid with what tasks you have to do. The experience looks great on you resume though.
bad,"Good place to work, not very much to do; front face items, cash people out and sweep.. staff are nice people.. pay is ok.. weekends is the busy times"
bad,Retail management is for those who do not have any commitments outside of the company. The hours are excessive and the responsibilities are many. The customers are the reward.
bad,"I worked for them a very short time. While I was with them we changed store managers three times, so they do not do well with management. Plus they do not take care of their people."
bad,The workplace is very stressful. Their company polices are very shallow and not able to be understood. They promote you and don't give you the proper training to complete the job.
bad,"Dollar General is somewhere retired people should work just to stay busy if your not a manager. Pay wasn't good at all, but, its a cool laid back job. The hardest part about it was how boring it could be."
bad,"It was okay, it was a job. I didn't like how the store was ran and there would be to many times where id be working and the line was to the back of the store and my manger was no where to be found. If I would have been in a better location and the store was ran differently with a better team I would have appreciated my job so much more."
bad,"As a Dollar General employee I was promoted in my first 3 weeks after my hire date. I earned my position as I showed excellent work ethic and management skills. The store manager was quick to work around my schedule which was also nice. However, there are no benefits with this company as they will not hire full-time and keep you long enough to receive benefits. Also, it is all about who you know. If you earn a position and work hard, then apply for a promotion, you will not receive one if anyone hire on the corporate ladder knows a friend of theirs needing a job. More professionally called Nepotism."
bad,The managers and sales associates at this location were very unprofessional and rude as ever to customers. The store was always dirty and cluttered and when the customers complained the complaints never got sought to so i had to leave that environment because that was not in my character to act in such a way.
bad,You're only saving grace at this store will be if you want to become a store manager. They treat employees like trash. Corporate doesn't care how management treats you (even if you're getting cussed out with a full line of customers). They look out for themselves. Seriously terrible company.
bad,I like my boss he was one of a kind. He always listened and understood where I was coming from. He'd walk around to make sure everything was going good. Always communicated with the customers.
bad,The company only cares about profit.  It doesn't matter how many hours management has to work as long as you stayed in your quota
bad,"A typical day consisted of customer service,stocking and plan-o-gram changes. I did not learn anything new at this company much of my own knowledge.  It was hard to get one on one training with the manager basically thrown to the wolves and learn on your own. The co-workers were kind but totally stressed out because of being short staffed."
bad,I couldn't stand working at dollar general the people I worked with were horrible. I couldn't stand it . I will never tell anyone to work at that dollar general
bad,Horrible Manager I will never recommend this company to family nor friends very disgusting atmosphere. MAnagement was a horror she lied and didn't take complete ownership of the store falsely adjusted time records so that nobody can get paid overtime and she had hours to schedule people. She also waited a day before the regional manager did a tour of the store to press had tasks of ensuring the whole store was clean. Made threats that if the regional wrote her up everybody in the store was going to get wrote up to.
bad,here you are a manager in title only. you spend 60+ hours a week stocking shelves. my payroll is very limited. but you do what you have to do. my store is ranked 4th in sales out of 159 in the region.
bad,"I loved working with the public , But management lacked in any kind of work spreading or  work lists for some people, The manager also lacked in managerial experience."
bad,I am not happy with this company at all. Dollar General does not know how to treat their employees. Working hard with time limits is almost impossible to get everything accomplished. going into an already broken store that needed a complete facelift without the help needed from the company was one of the hardest jobs that I have ever worked. I enjoyed the customers and my staff. but I am not happy with the corporate side of the company.
bad,"Retail inventory management.                Exceptional leader.          Conflict resolution skills.    Store operations.            Team-oriented."
bad,First I believe the empolyees are extermemly underpaid for the hours and work that is put in. The customers were my favorite part andthey kept me there. The upside is that they do pay weekly and thats great.
bad,This was a fun workplace for a starting job. The place was friendly and nice and clean but lacked proficient advancement opportunities for me. I sacrificed much of my personal time for the company with little compensation on the important things in my life i.e. doctors appointments. Overall this is a good company to work for if you don't have much else going on in your lie.
bad,"good and very busy."
bad,"Counting drawers, dropping off depots at the bank, checking in vendors, stocking shelves, customer service.  Co-workers worked together as a team to complete each daily tasks.  Hardest part was lifting heavy boxes/unloading truck.  The best part was working within my community and making new families."
bad,unsafe work place but good pay and hours fast paced work enviornment air conditiond
bad,The management here is horrible and if you are a manager the pay to what is expected is as low as it can be.  There is always ways to advance if you want to take on the hours and responsibility to be worked to death.  I would not recommend Dollar General to anyone except temporary employment.
bad,the days production vareys every day is a new one. i learned alot in terms of production and down time and how much that could cost the company. how small things like damages and lost product can also  hurt our overall profits at the end of every qauter.
bad,A typical day starts at 6am and typically ends around 6 pm 6days a week.
bad,"The company is rapidly growing so the potential for advancement is high especially if you are willing to relocate."
bad,"I liked my experience at Dollar General as a part time employee, you got the chance to assist a variety of people. The work at Dollar General was demanding, but the hours worked were never that long."
bad,"Not good Managment nor Co-Workers. I did alot of work for others but not getting credit, dont get me wrong i did the work but it became a everyday thing.."
bad,Most of the managers are great people. I worked with alot of great employees. The customers were nice to see everyday. The job kept me busy. I did get to advance and learn new things. A typical day at work was going in opening the store. Seeing the same faces everyday that put a smile on my face. I would work truck. I would check in vendors.
bad,a typical work day is two cashier and one MOD... and only one cashier will be open all day.
bad,Very fast paced work and very demanding expectations from management.
bad,"I was hired as lead cashier. My first day I was handed the keys, given a few codes and was told to call if I had any problems. I was closing the store! I was given no training on their partcular register system and ended up making mistakes without even knowing it. Everyone else there also said they weren't given any training, we were figuring out how to do things between ourselves. Of course, when I ran into problems the manager wouldn't stick up for me because then they would have found out she wasn't doing her job right and she would end up in trouble. What a joke!!"
bad,"There was two difficult aspects of the job. First was the management and co-workers that were not honest or had a misinterpretation of people.Secondly, was the very high expectations put on management and employees. Rules and regulations for in store workers needs to be revisited and made more attainable."
bad,We I arrived at work I would handle all the complaints from all customers and deal with vendor issues.
bad,Assistant Store Manager
bad,"Typical day, long hours & lots of multi-tasking."
bad,"My experience with Dollar General was very negative, although the environment of the store does depend on the leadership of the store manager. As anywhere else, a poorly run store will result in unhappy employees and dissatisfaction."
bad,Worked there 5 years as a assistant manager. Store manager showed & trained me a lot. That training & development has helped me to succeed & I am training to be a store manager myself
bad,"Retail eats at you, it's extremely discouraging. With little to no reward. My average paycheck was $120. I once only made $60 in a week. My highest paycheck was $230 because we were remodeling and I worked 38 hours."
bad,"Didn’t get any hours to get adjusted.Didn’t make much , less than 200 dollars. Maximum 4 hours a week during my employment. Managers weren’t any help , criticized over 1 mistake."
bad,"My manager was very organized, professional,  and provided clarity for each employee to understand the company's expectations completely in regards to the accountability of the duties for which the employee is responsible per shift. Regardless,  the company fails to allot the manager an appropriate amount of working hours to ensure the status quo of the store's functionality in an efficient manner.; therefore, most employees are exhausted and rushing through each task throughout the entire shift and its rare to have fully completed anything due to the necessity of direct customerservice at the register."
bad,"stock room was always backed up"
bad,"At my particular store I have a great manager who does wonders with scheduling and overseeing that we have what we need, she's a wonderful person to work for but there are problems within the company that prevent a lot of the managers from doing what they would like to do for their employees"
bad,"Your boss may give you what you need for your specific situation without compromising the needs of others, or they'll use you so only their needs are met whilst their employees are reprimanded for trying to get help with something or point out an abuse of power; higher ups may not help, if it looks bad on them."
bad,The manger is not very good.  Most of the employees are very hard workers.  Some don't act like they care about anyone but their self.   The best part of the job is the customers.
bad,"As a manager, many times I opened and ran the store by myself for hours before I got any kind of help. Which is against standards and practice. Even after a string of robberies that took place, this still happened. On a few occasions I would have to close the store by myself because people called off and the store manager wouldn't answer my calls or just flat out refused to come in and wouldn't let me close early."
bad,Was an okay job management needed work but that can be anywhere the thing was is my schedule it would be wrong almost every week and was hard to get changed
bad,Management is expected to over work themselves. Not enough support from higher up management. Very little hours provided to run the store. Some stores in dangerous areas with no security.
bad,"I wanted to work,  They refused me of working hard...They yelled at their employees. They liked certain employees.   Gave them the hours,  by letting them unload the truck on SUNDAY MORNING."
bad,Mgr. told me when I applied that she would move me to a store closer to home. She did not do so and refused so I had to leave that sight due to the cost of transportation.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at dollar general. I worked with some good people , and of course there were good days , and bad days. They really worked with my schedule and they got flexible hours."
bad,Dollar general wasn’t able to work with my availability . I was excited at first but it began to get frustrating when no one listened to my availability.
bad,"I’m friendly I love the law enforcement field . I loved working for corrections  I go to work I never call in  we are all about saftey and security "
bad,The store itself is not organized priorities are not straight too much talk not enough work and way too much gossip for a grocery chain. Starting pay decent and location is convenient.
bad,They were not organized they didn't have nothing right the customers was complaining we are managers was complaining and then there was a given as manager pay new giving us cashier pay and I feel like that was not right
bad,Need To Work On Manager Skills. Work On Organization. Give People Good Customer Service . Respect Each-other . Listen To Each Other . Make Sure Store Is Clean .
bad,The only things that I actually liked while I was there were my co-workers and a few of the customers. Barely any pay for the amount of work that you do.
bad,I learned a lot of different skills such as how to stock a shelf properly how to count a drawer properly how to direct-to-customer. Typical day was busy especially on holidays but working there was a good experience
bad,"I'm not going to discuss my years at this company, work there at your own risk. No comment  no comment no comment i don't want to discuss..i am not making any statements"
bad,"I literally worked everyday with no time off. The employees are awful with being on time or showing up for their shift. I had to stay multiple times whenever I didn’t have too just to help out the other employees, and I have a daughter to spend time with and barely got too. I had to leave because work was taking over my time that I could have gave to my daughter."
bad,Bad don’t like it management was bad pay was bad and everything wasn’t getting hours at all like I just dont like working their at all  but 401k was ok.
bad,Follar General as a company is not really worth working for unless you are super desperate for money. They never have enough hours or pay enough per hour. Not a livable wage. That's for sure
bad,"6 day work weeks. Payroll for associates are below average. If something happens you are responsible for being in the building no matter what. DMs provide no support. I worked 2 straight weeks of open to close shift due to having no key holders. Again DM did not care. If you have no family, wife/husband, or kids this maybe the job for you, otherwise stay far far away."
bad,"Hours are long and freight is never ending, you can never catch up. The best manager ive worked for. Very down to earth. I got along with everyone. Everyone was nice."
bad,"Working at Dollar General taught me more work ethics i didn’t have at first. I learned how to manage money, run registers, close and open the store. I’ve also met a bunch of new people from working there"
bad,"Dollar General is ok I,guess if you like working with a bunch,of gossiping 2 faced back stabbing lying people. The best part about that place is maybe couple employees from first shift was awesome. And. Of course the awesome customers,"
bad,"I was robbed twice in this establishment, not enough man hours for these stores. what more you need me say, NOT ENOUGH HELP IN THESE STORES...Have a Blessed and safe work experience at Dollar General"
bad,"The location I worked at was consistently understaffed. Workers had no choice but to endure long hours. I was asked to fill in as assistant manager only till they could hire someone. However, after several weeks, a hire was still not made. I had to sever ties due to being pushed beyond my physical limitations."
bad,This job puts the stress on one person to complete a job of 2 or more. You need to be able to cash customers out as well as stock the selfs as well as handle the cash between the office and the bank.
bad,"When I first started I was brought on very quickly and was just thrown in without ever even being told I had gotten the job. I hardly got any training and when I did eventually someone would tell me that it was wrong and have me do it a different way. I would get praise about something one day and then corrected the next. I never felt comfortable with any of the managers because, even though you need them for most cash register issues beyond just ringing things up, they would act as if you were trying to inconvenience them. I was never properly trained, I just followed someone around one day and then set free to do what needed to be done the next with no additional help. This may be normal, but that isn't how I learn so I would frequently forget to do something and then instead of talking to me about it I would get passive aggressive comments about it where they would say they continuously noticed it but didn't bother to say anything to me. "
bad,"Overall I really liked working here, my managers were really nice to me and it was a somewhat easy job. The pay however was not worth it. Just being a cashier I had to be the only one to ring up customers, clean the front of the store, clean the bathroom, stock the front of the store, stock the mini fridge of sodas, etc... and all of that I was maybe working 25 hours a week at 8.50 an hour?"
bad,I will be there two years in November.  I love to work hard. They do not see how hard i work. I love my job. My pays low and find out others are making more than me. I work hard I need better pay to support my four teen sons.
bad,"Working at dollar general is kinda stressful at times because good help is hard to keep because the pay isn’t where it should be. Also, the hours stay inconsistent, one day you could close at 10:00 p.m., but be expected to open the next day at 6:00 a.m."
bad,The pay at dollar general is not enough to afford the cost of living and the area managers are very stuck on themselves and rude. They always expect you to do more than what you’re suppose to do and paid for.
bad,"This company made us do alot of and be under staff and not have enough hours. We work alot by ourselves , stock , cash handling, Planogram, endcap, check in vendors, hire, train new hires, hire for other stores. Resolves customer complaints etc."
bad,Not a good paying business.  Rarely does anyone get a raise.  Other than that it was an okay company to work for.  Not very friendly management. Pays weekly
bad,I liked the job that I did but the manager had a poor attitude .  I ran the register and when I wasn't busy I stocked the front half  of the store I liked my customers
bad,"Though the pay is not all that good,  ita a good place to work if everyone poses as a team player.  However if you are not a people person, this isn't the job for you"
bad,"So as far as the job goes itself, just like any job don't get too close to your co-workers. Keep to yourself and keep conversations to minimum and just do your job. Now the management and the overall quality of workers I worked with at these dollar general locations are absolutely horrific. Honestly makes me never want to work at a another Dollar General ever again. I don't even shop at the Dollar General locations anymore and until they have new people in there stores in Bainbridge area, I never will unless I absolutely have too. The pay is not very competitive. You start at $7.38 as a cashier. Moves up $7.85 as a keyholder, then $8.25. For some managers you only get a $.25 up as a raise. I wounded up only getting up to $8.75hr before I got fired. I got fired due to prejudice and hate but I won't discuss that.  You work like a dog and get no appreciation (however this is nothing new, most jobs are like this). So I will say this, this was my first job so don't look at it like it is beneath you or you hate it. Take it as a learning experience, take it as a grooming tool. No matter the circumstance, you can always take a lesson from anything. As I mentioned before, do not get too close to your co-workers, keep it professional with both your co-workers and your customers. I was blessed with another job so the things I learned from Dollar General, I will definitely take with me on my new job. How to handle co-workers, customers, bosses, etc."
bad,"Pros: Great company"
bad,its an okay job I wouldn't go back to work there. I did love 1st shift and the hours we had other than that its really nothing good to say about the good ole DG
bad,"The company is ok, they are not for good with working with your hours, they would not give more then 15 hours a week even if you could work any hours."
bad,"Pay sucks.  Not enough hours.  People working that should be fired.  I'm sure there is a ""smoking marijuana while on the clock"" policy that is not followed.   Theft is bad."
bad,Management was not friendly and the pay was not great. Stores are short staffed and other staff members are rude. Customer complaints were unbelievable.
bad,The pay was good but the staff was terrible. They refused to give me bereavement time when my father passed. Most of the employees you work with were decent just managers and supervisor were bad. They mandate overtime at the last minute a lot.
bad,"cant hire and keep decent employees due to drama and inconsistent policies. I love customer service, the regulars are like family. The pay is low and there is a big do as I say and not as I do type atmosphere."
bad,it wasnt that hard to work there. it was just unsatisfying. i was a high school senior turned recent graduate and i needed a job and the money was adequate enough at the time but i would never go back again.
bad,"Great for students trying to make extra money while still maintaining a sports career or a social life. overall easy job,nice hours just not a good job for someone to make a living off."
bad,"i did learn about customer service from the stand point of a supervisory position. there were more downs than ups for working for this company. i had to quit in the end due to lack of management and how the management treated their employees. There were not enough employees to man the store, in turn another supervisor and myself and two employees had to take care of the store for one week, while our new manager was in another state doing her training. The other supervisor and i were mandated to stay because there was no assistant manager and employees below supervisor could not be in the store alone to manage it"
bad,Dollar general was a great place to work other thaan bad management.Stocked isles and did cashier and was key holder.Manager  didnt want us to have breaks at all.
bad,"I have worked in management for over 12 years of my life, and Dollar General is by far the worst company for which I have worked.  There is no connection between corporate management and store employees, other than the tip of the bullwhip.  If you enjoy never seeing your family, working harder than anyone else in the company, and an insulting salary, then a management career at Dollar General is the perfect fit for you."
bad,"Good customer Service "
bad,"Ok for someone who wants to work part time. My co-workers were great, management was fine. Again it is part time and low pay and you work hard for that."
bad,"Loved working there nice people I always had a smile on my face, I did my hardest when I did my job I always put the customers first. I make sure the job is done right."
bad,"Expected us to work hard and do more than time allotted."
bad,You are not compensated very well for the amount of work you have to do. The amount of work expected from even a key holder is ridiculous in correlation to the pay provided.
bad,"I quit after two weeks because they did not work around my school schedule, the managers made several rude remarks, and the overall environment was depressing. They had me on the front register and expected me to stock and face the items on shelves. There were U-boats on the end caps of each aisle full of stock that would never get stocked to the shelves. The store looked like a teenager's messy bedroom. Even though I was in college, I felt like a failure at life working here. Please, do not work for this company."
bad,Harsh workloads while given not near enough hours for all tasks the company wanted done. Company refuses to take care of store appearances such as tile floor maintenance(strip and wax).
bad,"seemingly built to wear people out. understaffed, even the best workers had to beg for enough hours to make the job worthwhile. worked there for 6 years and went through 6 or 7 store managers in that time, because they are expected to work 60-80 hours a week on salary to make up for the lack of payroll to go to hourly employees.."
bad,Store Manager committed fraud and stole employee time and wages. Falsified records and provided limited training. As a first time job it was a poor work environment with limited management after the Store Manager was removed.
bad,"Working for dollar general was, for me, never rewarding. Usually there were only two employees left to run the store at any given moment and management was rarely seen. Pay was low, and work fluctuated from what was essentially constant breaks to nonstop work in a matter of minutes."
bad,You can work hard but in the end get took advantage of. The manager I worked for was very unprofessional. If you come in on your days off due to call out they will always call you and if you dont come in for the they will get mad.
bad,I was there for 5 years and didn't make more than a dollar higher than when I was hired. The hours are inconsistent and room for advancement is practically non-existent.
bad,Job was good sometimes but stressful when attending to customers all the time especially on holidays and sales. Its a matter of how well it can be handled.
bad,"Company I worked for was four season recruitment there are the worse agency the consultants there are liars!! They haven't given me shifts and don’t listen to what you actually want as in interests of work, very poor communicating!!! "
bad,"It could have been a better experience, but it was awful. I was mostly on my own and there was no one willing to help me. Their management skill were poor and the lack of communication was not great."
bad,I’ve never seen a company so cheap literally the cash registers are always acting up and they’re so old & these managers want you to do everything for very little pay
bad,"Low pay for all that is asked of you to do. Sometimes you work by yourself.  No consistency in hours. Low pay, low pay! Alot of walking,  little or no time to sit."
bad,"Will have to stand in one spot for the entire 8 hour shift. Hours suck, pay is not great. Will start out minimum wage. Will maybe only get 15 to 20 hours a week max."
bad,"Overall the job was secure and paid fairly for work done, though I cannot say I would go back if given the option. Higher level management overstocked (and thus overworked) many of us and caused quite a messy environment to move around in. Some easy to accomplish tasks of course; just more work than could be accomplished by the staff."
bad,It was very fasted paced. I worked there for about 3 months and about 2 weeks in was expected to know where everything was and how much everything was. I knew how to run the register but I am one to do things correctly the first time and the get the speed but that wasn't good enough. I was expected to get the customer through the line fast and accurately the first. Some of the managers there were fairly nice but there were a few that rude to everyone even the customers.
bad,This place was not bad I enjoyed it especially after I had my daughter it was simple enough work to do where I was able to stock the shelf and redeIne the shelf wen new prod come
bad,"Not enough hours. There a lot by myself which is unsafe and hectic. Flexible hours, but not really worth what you're paid for the work you have to do."
bad,The store was a total mess when I began to work there no one knew anything even the store manager being that she transferred from another store we tried to get it in order but management wouldn’t allow
bad,"Organization skills is a must have as well as customer service. It is a very slow paced job so to keep busy you have to find things to like for example, clean the glass doors, sweep, organize shelves continuously, keep register area clean."
bad,"Dollar General was a very nice place to work. There are many  locations  for dollar general. Depending  on the location it would be a great place to start a job. But some locations needs police officers, because some places are dangerous."
bad,"Dealing with higher ups above manger was difficult at times. Had 4 different one at my time there. Each one had a different style to management,  including micromanaging ."
bad,Great place to work and meet people daily also I learned more about operated a cash register and how to greet people and how provide customer service.
bad,the workers are very sweet there just a slow environment. Hardest part of job was getting the computers to work sometimes. I enjoyed the people though.
bad,"How much you like this job is determined by the people you find yourself surrounded by. Good coworkers and friendly customers will make a shift fly by. One gets the feeling that upper management feels that employees are a necessary evil that requires close supervision, though."
bad,"When I worked there it was more for a person looking for a summer or part time job, not the place for a career or to raise a family. Pay was minimum wage."
bad,The hardest part of the job was having enough hours for the amount of work that is required to be done. The best part of the job was the customers.  The DM was an awesome person and helped with all questions and concerns.
bad,I preformed all manager duties with out manager pay. I was promised shift changes and pay but was put off my manager for nearly a year. The job itself was satisfying.
bad,it was a great place to work. I did a lot in working seven months there. My former co workers and assistant managers helped me a lot and taught me what not to do in that prefession.
bad,"Didn't want to give you breaks and if you were the only scheduled cashier for 6-8 hrs it was teeth pulling to get a bathroom break much less a 10 minute and we won't mention lunch.  Sorry for the negativity, but a really bad experience."
bad,"At dollar general you work long hours for no pay and deal with some of the rudest people on a daily basis, now this is not all stores but i do feel for what you do for the company they could at least pay you more."
bad,"Some of the customers are really entitled and annoying. You will be the cashier, the stock person, and the janitor. It can be physically demanding and at times, you will be doing so much that customers are left waiting since only 2 people work at a time. Management is nice but this is a job you get in and get out of quickly. Would not recommend."
bad,"It was a good place to work while I was getting through college. It would not have worked for a long term position, but I was given good opportunities and hours while I was there. "
bad,"the work Environment  was stressful "
bad,The whole While i was there it was located in a rough area. Most times shop lifters would come in and try to take items every weekend. I'm really looking for something new and that will work with me.
bad,I loved working with the customers and talking with everybody I am a social butterfly but It's very stressful at times and it can get busy so suddenly. It's the perfect job for people who are fast paced and always on their toes.
bad,Not worth working at. Other jobs have similar pay and require much less work. Stores generally have one to two members on site at any time to do the work of at least four people. The technology used is awful and extremely archaic.
bad,The managment wasn’t all that great at dollar general but the customers made everything better. It was a fun place to work but I did not like the hours.
bad,"there where never enough people and registers where very out of date, break down often. Was to do 3-4 jobs in a short period of time so most of the work may have not been done correctly. many workers were unhappy."
bad,I liked working there at first until I started getting talked about behind my back and just got criticized and never directed how to do it right. I think if I would have had a different manager I would have stayed.
bad,Customers were great for the most part but management was a problem. Schedules came out either the day of or the day before. Management wouldn't confront other employees about wrongdoings and would sweep things under the rug.
bad,"Fast pace work environment. No time to take care of your personal matters without being pushed for terminations. All jobs are what we make it. Stay organized and complete task in a timely manner, the typical work day will be productive."
bad,"Running truck and Cash register."
bad,Really didn't have enough hours to have full time just part time. MY paying per hour wasn't what I want after working for 2 years with Dollar General.
bad,I enjoyed the opportunity working for dollar general but due to poor hours and lack of respect from co workers and disorganization i removed myself from the job.
bad,"They do not pay good enough for all the work you have to do here. I was a cashier in had to clean up wen no one was at my register in stock the shelves, ect."
bad,It was the worst job I've had so far the customers were rude and the pay was terrible and most of the manager's were not helpful when it came to solving problems
bad,"The store was very disorganized.  Not enough good help.  A lot of bending, lifting, stocking, unloading, cleaning up after customers made messes.  The store was very dirty."
bad,As a store manager for DG you can expect long hours year round.  The company cuts staffing budgets so thin that the manager has no choice but to pick up the slack
bad,Some management doesn't care about their stores. constantly a mess and workplace was very fast paced and sometimes it was slow at night. I started tills and counted deposits . took money to the bank and covered brakes and watch cameras for LP.
bad,It was a decent job for someone looking to get something quick. For someone who is in high school or just out of college i would recommend it.Other than that...
bad,Nothing needs to be discussed about this job with anyone about anything the company is a modern day Mafia without the cement boots and anyone dumb enough to work then deserves the stress that follows them
bad,"I enjoyed working there, it was a fun relaxed environment. I learned a lot working for this company. I was not very impressed with the lack of security."
bad,"At the store location I was in, the management was very unprofessional, and cared very little for the workers or store itself. Typically we would start by removing all the expired goods from the shelf, stock all the new product, then run isles to keep them clean. we had only two people at a time and some days it just wasn't enough"
bad,Dollar General does not pay you enough for all the work they require you to perform.  The customer frequency is too high for the cashier to restock shelves.  The stores are junkie because of this and they really need to hire an overnight crew to stock. They do have the money!
bad,"The management was ok, but it wasn't worth the pay. It was very stressful, and it isn't being stuck working at a place that barely pays enough to get by and keep a roof over your head."
bad,I liked the location and people that i worked with i liked cashier and stocking and the hours and pay where decent. I had to leave the work place even though i did not want to because i had a unplanned pregnancy and was high risk and could not work.
bad,I personally didn't like work here all to much is was stressful all the time. Team was lacking in most things although the manners were pretty fair and helped out frequently.
bad,the manger at this store was great but the company not so much. they want you to advance but do not pay well for advancement. expect more work without more pay.
bad,The management was poor. I worked more than 50 hours a week most of the time.  there wasn't enough people working there to get daily stuff done that needed to be.
bad,The job itself was just fine. No hard work essentially to be done. However my reason for leaving the company would be due to not being a very safe environment to work in. Their stores are always being robbed.
bad,"customer service "
bad,I Had People smiling a lot They liked me and i learned how to do teamwork and manage to do things at one time i did Everything w i was told to do early or even on time i had time management i came early everyday to work the hardest part of the job was the end of the day when i was clocking out it sometimes didn't even let me
bad,"4 years of management with dollar general and I barely make over $10 an hour. I work EVERY weekend and many changing shifts. Sometimes required to work double shifts if closing management called in, and had no choice in it. 6a.m.-10:30p.m."
bad,"Was not my cup of tea. I tried giving them chances to give me help with their scheduling issues, but with no resolve. The are too lenient on call-in and that left the people that showed up for work having to pull doubles."
bad,The DSM belittled her people to the point of explaining how to wash a window. Managers/Asst. Mngrs. are expected to babysit DSM when she is in the store (Because she is the center of their world) they are to drop everything and follow her around and write down what she wants done. - Because apparently she has lost ability to write herself.
bad,It was fun working at dollar general.  A typical day at work was very bust the customers were nice/   The sales associates were very friendly and willing to help any customer that comes in.
bad,"Great work environment, low pay for what all you have to do as a Lead from dealing with customers to employees to truck drivers and any other issues t."
bad,I had a great experience working for Dollar General. I learned so much. My manager was awesome. I could call him for any problem and if he didn't know how to solve it then he would ask someone and notify me.
bad,Working there was the most horrible thing I've ever experienced. Management in that business is nothing but snobby stuck up people who think they are entitled to everything.
bad,"For the amount I am getting paid, its not worth it especially all the stuff you have to do in the store. You have to watch your back 24/7 to make sure you are good, amd make sure nobody steals."
bad,The dollar general is ok to work at but not a permit home. They don't give many raises and you work so hard they don't help you to get promoted. Its a hard job and no reflection for the work you do.
bad,Very poor management and higher ups. I stayed stressed out working there and should not have been that stressed working in a retail store. There was no balance between work and home life. I was called constantly while off the clock! Had to do other peoples jobs without the pay.
bad,"The atmosphere was nice because we had fun and (mostly) productive employees. The district manager was a tool, but that could be said about pretty much any retail job. As far as retail goes, it's not that bad."
bad,Relatively easy job but decisions of above store management leads to under staffing that can make achieving store goals difficult. As long as the employees are willing to work though the experience is not that bad.
bad,"I was not happy with the management,"
bad,It was not the job for me.  I did not have good manager or assistant managers.  The corporation was a good corporation to work for just not the specific branch I was at.
bad,"We would come in at 6pm- till 5am unloaded trailer tractor trucks. Being in that job & around the equipment I learned a lot & everything was based off production. I enjoyed the friendly environment, the fact that everyone was & is a team."
bad,felt like I was used at the store. no good communication and my hours changed every week. there was no room for advancement and the manager was hardly on site
bad,Typical day consist of working yourself in the ground.You learn to hustle and it is never enough.Corporate  management does not look out for the little guy.Workplace consist of major stress.The hardest part was stocking  and lack of employees to do so.The only enjoyable part was dealing with the public.
bad,"The typical day at work was a mix between slow and quick. There were times where it would get really busy and, as a lead sales associate, if you had work to do besides run the register, you more than likely didn't get it done. The hardest part of the job was the messy and inconsistent management. And, the most enjoyable part was the connection between the District Manager and the Associates."
bad,"Dollar General is a decent company to work for. However, If you are a student, and a parent, it is difficult to have time to study and be with your child. I was told that my job was more important than my child, and my responsibility was to Dollar General rather than my family. I understand I was part of the management team, and my duties were very important there, however, when my child is sick, or I have no babysitter my responsibility becomes my daughter. My immediate supervisors were very unorganized when it came to scheduling, but they always found someone to cover shifts that were overlooked or double scheduled. Dollar General is a very hard company to move up in unless you are hired on as a manager, or you have worked for the company for a while. You get paid every week which is great!"
bad,"the management staff taught me a lot they make sure that I was trained properly, every issue I had with drama with the employees they make sure that it was handled."
bad,"The only benefit of this job is the pay and the insurance, but the way they work and treat you its a must that you use you insurance overall its a ok place to work"
bad,"The stress on the employees on the front lines started with the CEO. They want 97% utilization on their vehicles, when over 10% of their fleet is out of service, that puts you in the negative. The company as a whole overbooks the cars on purpose, it puts a lot of stress and anxiety on the employees, and angers the customers, with good reason."
bad,"It really depends on who you work with and your management. If everyone has a positive attitude, it will make for a more fun environment."
bad,I had some regular customers but most of the day consisted of cleaning and stocking. There few other people that worked there so you either get along or don't.
bad,"As far as the positives of Dollar General go, more freedom is one of the few.  Coming from ShopRite, and being micromanaged by four different managers in one shift, to be able to work for a smaller store where you're encouraged to take the initiative yourself and solve your own tasks was and still is a huge positive.  It forces you to learn more about what you're doing, and how to troubleshoot and solve problems that you'll run into if you advance to higher levels."
bad,A typical day at work i learned how to be a cashier and the most enjoyable part of the job is to meet different people. The hardest is part is being unaware that i do people shifts that don't come to work.
bad,"By far the worst job I have ever had. There are a lot of extra ""rules"" that are not in the handbook. Managers do not follow rules or procedures. District managers do not notice other employees."
bad,"Although sometimes challenging, my job at Dollar General was always rewarding. They give you the opportunity to grow in the company."
bad,good place but very long hours. employee roll over is high due to the amount of hours worked by employees and no time off even at hollidays. close to home
bad,the management seems to only partially care about the customers experience (never acted like they wanted to be there or that they wanted to assist them) or their employees.
bad,Nice people but always understaffed and yet still expected to get same amount of work done with 3 people when you should have 6
bad,Bad people to work for. They don't care about their employees. They are looking for reasons to fire everyone that does a great job.
bad,Management changes & lack of a consistent one led to the staff kind of not being as serious in the work they were doing. Schedules were good but then people wouldn't show up and things so it got stressful.
bad,Good job just not enough hours and benefits for a regular sales associate . Also there are no good benefits like Dg warehouse gets . We need more hours and min wages with three kids in Mississippi isn't enough to make it.
bad,I never work with the manager and I have not really had any training.  They only give me 4 hours a week and it's hard to learn where stock goes on the shelves.
bad,"The job is an easy and decent job, however the salary is very low and you don't get many hours. The pay is not worth the stress."
bad,good place to work but to many duties compared to the pay. I feel that i should have been paid more compared to the others that was making more and was doing less of the responsibilities .
bad,The most enjoyable thing about that job was learning new things n building my customer service skills n learning how to do inventory
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job at Dollar General was training.  Watching my subordinates grow, develope and become successful."
bad,"This would be a great place to work if there were more teamwork and friendlier atmosphere. The employees there makes it a dog eat dog environment. Plus they are more concern with who is having relations with who than they are for the inmates. I learned the importance of minding your own business. Some co-workers were friendlier than others but there was a click like in high school. You had the popular ones, nerds, vets, and newbies. Everyone seemed to complain about working there. I did enjoy dealing with the inmates."
bad,"There were only ever two or three employees in the store and everyone talked about each other behind each other's back.  It was ridiculous.  There were no short breaks, only 30 minute breaks if your shift was longer than six hours.  The managers always got plenty of smoke breaks, though."
bad,I only worked at Dollar General to make some extra money for college. I did my tasks of taking care of my customers as well as some other tasks. I would not work there again.
bad,Great place to work. They have great benefits. The managers go above and beyond to be sure you succeed in everything you do there.
bad,"A typical day at Dollar General is stocking shelves, helping customers and cleaning. It was a simple job. I enjoyed working there and all the customers we had. It was not a difficult job. I can't say one bad thing about working for Dollar General."
bad,I worked at Dollar General almost 2 years. I was a Lead Sales Associate and I was hired with them knowing that I was attending college.
bad,"Store has great potential, but unfortunately is under poor and unprofessional management. "
bad,"Good job to have, not so much fast paced unless there is a few people in the store. Also you cannot have a discount because the store has 5000 and more items for a dollar or less. If your used to fast food then this isnt the job for you."
bad,"you will work more hours than they pay you, and if you do not follow the recommended training guidelines thinking outside the box is not encouraged."
bad,The job was alright. I was just looking for something that paid more than $8.25. The customers were very nice and my co workers were awesome.
bad,"There was no communication when something was done wrong, if you messed up hours got cut with no explanation. Confusion between shifts on what was done/needed to be done"
bad,Very unenjoyable work experience because of the failure of the manager to meet employee needs and failure of management in the area of training needs.
bad,"Because of the shortage of employees, you would find yourself working alone at night and during heavy service times.  The pay ratio to hours worked and what they expected is very low."
bad,I like the job but the management and office needed to get thing together. They were asking me to do things that was against company policy.
bad,A lot of opportunity to grow great learning experience best place to really use your management skills to the fulliest.
bad,It is work. There are little or no hours then a million because no one stays at this job because you do more than you get payed for.
bad,"The idea of learning Retail was agreeable. Patronage was iffy, loss and compensation hefty. Waiting for a Pain and Suffering review."
bad,"the work enviroment was fun, exciting, and the was always a challenge to over come. The down fall was being away from home as much as this job required."
bad,"I was promised more hours, but never got any. I felt as though the manager was playing favorites who got more hours. Overall not a great place to work."
bad,"I would clock in and immediately go to my register. I mostly stayed on register all day, unless my manager at the time said otherwise. I don't like how Dollar General treats their employees."
bad,"Seeking change due to lack of support from superiors. I am not a manager that accepts ""average"" as being acceptable.  Daily stocking required to maintain in-stock levels for customers convenience."
bad,"I personal think that the Dollar General that I worked for needed a lot of improvement as far as with management. A typical day at Dollar General for me was the same thing every day and the same people every day which I loved the most ,but the management was very poor and they did not act concerned for the customers nor the employers at all. the most enjoyable part of this job was working with different personalities of the customers whom I really enjoyed"
bad,"I made decent money working here because I was always on the schedule. I enjoyed working here more than Shoe Show because I was usually constantly busy. I like having work to do and learning new stuff, but you can only learn so much in a small retail business. I hated having to stock every Sunday morning at 6am. Once the boss found something you were good at, you never received a break from it. I was about to be wrote up because people were not buying a lot of items when I ran the register. You cannot make people buy items. Plus, I was always working the early or late shifts."
bad,"Start day by counting till, then day starts with ringing up customers, in between customers, you will be stocking. need to hire more staff if management wasn't things done in a timely manner"
bad,"Loved interacting with the general public, coworkers not always pleasant some people are lazy and like to cause conflict between others"
bad,"Opening and closing of store, deposits and money handling, giving change and drawer counts, customer service, refunds, exchanges. Stocking and store tidiness inside and out. Receiving trucks and vendors.  Supervision of employees. Theft control. Basically all managerial duties as assigned. Co-workers had a big turn around but everyone I worked with I enjoyed having them as a co-worker. Hardest part of the job were the late night hours and dealing with disgruntled customers. Most enjoyable part was always meeting new faces and developing solid relationships with regular customers."
bad,There is never understanding of time or family.  As manager you consistently work 70 plus hours.  and when you are off you are always getting phone calls.
bad,"Anyone at or above Key-holder makes FAR too little to sufficiently compensate for the amount of work expected.  HR does not have a good or even decent recruiting system, and it often takes several weeks and in my case 2 months to get through the very first portion of the hiring process.  By then, most people have found other work, which leaves a skeleton crew to run the store, often meaning some key carriers do not get a single day off for upwards of 3 weeks.  Retention is horrible, nearly everyone that has ever joined the crew have quit within 3 months, saying it was too much work for not enough money.  This is not a recommended employer."
bad,As a member of management I was expected to put in 60-70 hours a week due to their inability to retain employees. Way too many days where I closed and had to open 6 hours later.
bad,"A typical day at work includes no breaks for anyone.  I enjoy working with my co workers and managers, but the company needs to quit working all stores on skeleton crews."
bad,Dollar General was my first job. I was able learn some learn leadership and management skills. It was a time where i learned how to work with team environment and how to work with guest.
bad,The work was more than could be done in the amount of time you were scheduled for. There was no air conditioning in the store and the summers were horrible. Employees would work until they almost passed out
bad,The company provides benefits for full time employees. You must be a full time employee to be eligible for benefits. Medical insurance is part of benefits package.
bad,"I typically work the cash register. I multi task from cash register to unload totes/ stock, assist customers with any questions. Management is great. Many positive improvements with the store has been made in a short period of time. The unfortante part of my job would be not enough staff for how busy that our location can get. Sometimes customers get upset for waiting in line for too long when I am the only register at our busy location. However, customers are my favorite part of my day. Speaking with them is my pleasure over the period of my shift. Keeps my day moving; and quick at that."
bad,"fast paced, never enough associates working, management to busy to help,co-workers hardly helped, hardest part dealing with all customers and tending to stock alone"
bad,"Your alone alot of the day and there is no homelife balance to speek of , the work load itself isn't bad, The upper mgmt. changes a lot"
bad,"Ive learned and grew a lot with this company, however I don't want to work for them anymore. They work you to death and have unrealistic goals to make their company number one. You cant run a store on no hours and be caught up with the amount of work they expect to be done in a week. Its very unfair!"
bad,"that's it. really lame customers, usually trashy or ghetto. being a manager there is only 8 bucks, that says a lot. oh and i got robbed there too."
bad,well when a new boss comes they should forget about the pass of a associate life and go on and let them work cause the manager wasnt there for that old stuff also he seem so prejudice what a 2 man do he got a one man doing it no he needs to be fired are let go we need friendly people in VIENNA GA. yes some just work to get a check but i was there for the people
bad,I was hired in as an outsider for this store.  The current employees did not want me there.  They were mad and upset because of the fact that their assistant did not get the GM position.  They made my time at DG very hard.
bad,"Responsible for the expedient and accurate handling of merchandise into and/or out of the  warehouse facility. The warehouse duties occur within the assigned area of the warehouse operations, but position supports all areas of the warehouse as needed."
bad,"I wasn't really into the retail work force. I did like meeting customers, but I was lacking something fulfillment in the job."
bad,"I worked at an older store and it was not very clean, however the newer stores are not so bad.  I enjoy the customer interaction."
bad,Loading trucks with roll containers filled with product. Pushing the limit of yourself to stay working fast and keeping up. Management was poor when it came in the need of help. Most of the co-workers were not very helpful. Pushing and pulling very heavy weighted roll containers the whole shift. Learning a new job was very exciting.
bad,Dollar general is a very productive place to work and a good place to learn about customer service.very helpful management staff to ensure that the associates have the proper training for the job they need to do.
bad,The new store manager is very difficult to work for.  Customers are not happy with store.  There are many complaints.  Co workers are not happy with the store manager and it makes the job more difficult.
bad,"In order to get ahead, you basically have to kiss tail. Hard work is rarely appreciated. The place has a bad reputation and I finally see why. The lazy employees who constantly call out and slack off in order to make someone else pick up their slack are the ones who end up getting their way or unpunished. The people who are actually there to do their job and are hardworkers are the ones who are treated unfairly. They are the ones who have to stay over for work, etc. When you first get hired in, the management seems very upbeat and seemed to enjoy their job... I was pleased and impressed with this. I was actually a little excited to start working there but I've quickly learned that they are completely oblivious to anything going on in the factory. If you decide to work here, keeping to yourself is best considering the amount of drama thats there. Working here will really rough up your hands and don't dare ask for gloves because the management will basically tell you that they don't have the budget to afford gloves for their employees. Some departments have very thin gloves but they are not accessible to everyone and they are not cut resistant. The worst part of this job is never knowing when you will get off work. This is a huge inconvenience because what if you have children at home or they go to daycare or school? If your schedule on paper is 5-1:30 that doesn't mean anything. You can and most likely won't be getting off until about 3 or 4. You leave when all orders are done."
bad,Unload trucks & stocked shelves.  I learned the management side of the job because I was the third key manager.  Learn to open and close the store.  Enjoyed working with my co-workers and management.  It was an all around good job.
bad,"The management was Terrible, they didnt have us with set schedules, so it was kind of difficult."
bad,"A work day at Dollar General for me consisted of stocking product, customer care, and cashier while keeping a neat and orderly work environment."
bad,No one wanted to do the tasks that was required. Employees were always late or never came to work when scheduled.
bad,"I had different tasks to do everyday. the customers and i would hold conversions. i would be on the cash register  where i helped the customer with their purchases. as i assistant manager, i would count the registers that were used and make the deposit for the night."
bad,At the time that I was employed I had an excellent manager but that is about all the good that I can say. The pay is horrible. Only work here if you can find nothing else or as a last resort.
bad,not very clean. very stressful environment. overall employees are helpful.
bad,the work was hard and the workers were nice the management cared about nothing but management.
bad,a typical day was quiet with very few customers. i learned how to maintain a store as if it were my own.
bad,Every moring after clocking in Ireport to the manager to get my draw in
bad,Dollar General had a very horrible management team. The  work schedule was supposed to be made at least a week in advance it would be made on the day of...
bad,I would make associates schedules.  Drop off nightly deposits at the bank.  Help customers find items and ring them up.  Stock the shelves and put up the overstock in the back.
bad,"In my experience management is sloppy and hours are terrible, pay just as terrible. Just a waste of time if you're not in management."
bad,"Dollar General does not care much about its employees or those that shop there. There are great managers out there, but most of the time, it is corporate that makes issues."
bad,I learned to help others while doing my job in a clean yet efficent manor. Also I learned to deal with different situations while being respectful and always smile.
bad,"This was my first job in high school, where I was responsible for basic cashier duties and managing my drawer."
bad,When I first started there I loved and enjoyed coming to work. I feel like certain people aren't trained enough for there field.
bad,In working at Dollar General I gained valuable skills but was trained improperly which ultimately led to me being let go. I do however appreciate the experience I received.
bad,I liked the experience that I gained working there. I enjoyed learning all that I could about being in a management position
bad,i liked the work there and i met some really good people. i would work there again if i was given the chance
bad,I have met some incredible people. I would help people find things around the store and check out customers at the register. I would stock product on the shelves and make sure the products are accessible to customers. My co-workers are great but the management was horrible. They were prejudice at times and I did not appreciate it. My customers were great. They were polite and understanding.
bad,manager was not the best. didnt like it when we needed off made us work a double shift
bad,"Generally a slow paced environment during business hours. I learned a great deal about the customer's concern for value. The hardest part of the job was learning how influential ""supply and demand"" truly is. I learned to adapt to disgruntled customers by focusing on their needs and not their discontent in the absence of a desired item. Management was a little on the weak-side, but that was mostly due to transitional complications."
bad,A typical day would be me at the cash register. I would greet every customer that walked into the store and I would also help them find whatever they needed. The managers were nice people and very helpful and patient with me when I first started. The hardest part of the job was trying to get more hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the nice customers.
bad,"Good for teaching folks ground rules in sales, socializing w/ customers. How to deal w/ an angry mob LOL. "
bad,I enjoy working there but i need a more steady full-time job.
bad,"i ran cashier, greeted customers . and did store recovery. i helped assist customers with items prices etc."
bad,Not enough pay for the amount of responsibility and the amount of work that has to be done.
bad,"Dollar General is not the best place to work at. for a place where everything is so cheap, the management is on top of every little thing you do and do not do."
bad,The management at Dollar General could be very cruel and mean at times and depending on the employee show favoritism to employee's they like best when it comes to scheduling for holidays and weekends.
bad,"I enjoy working at Dollar General because i enjoy Customer Service  and the co-workers are great. However, the benefits are horrible and getting promoted is difficult. Dollar General is greedy."
bad,"Weak and sloppy corporate structure, along with low wages for management. Little to no appreciation for hard work."
bad,A typical retail job. There were always people steeling and the pay wasn't the greatest. Workers and management always change.
bad,"DG was an okay place to work until you start getting into management, I recommend this place for someone without kids and a spouse"
bad,Terrible management . Lack of cleanliness. Wouldn't recommend this job .
bad,i work at dollar general as a sales associate and I really like it but i need more of a steady full-time employment to be able to take care of my children..... I'm only working there part time
bad,"With this company, I had the chance to learn even more in my management experience. My manager was a very great person to learn from and look up to."
bad,"at work all we do is recover and stock, the store is usually very slow and most of us only get 4 hours a week and now I have no hours at all for 3 weeks because they have no hours to give to others. The most enjoyable part is probably my coworkers."
bad,"I didn't enjoy really working there because there really wasn't any stability within the workplace but overall the customers were very nice, but I still enjoy shopping there."
bad,work 8 hours a day learned how to stock co-worker was great stocking meeting new people
bad,This was just a typical job to make ends meet until a better opportunity presented itself.
bad,A typical day is checking people at and geeting rude customers daily talking to you and the employees make you feel uncomfortable and dont really care what they say.
bad,Always cleaning and stocking and ringing register.  No time to interact with customers.  Always being watched coached when needed.
bad,"Dealt with the public, did cashiering, stocking, greeting customers, and answering their questions"
bad,"a typical day at work is working hard to get everything done in 10-hrs."
bad,Was a fun working environment. Very fast paced and I got to learn a lot about balancing the registers and making bank deposits. 
bad,"Enjoyed working in my hometown; intended on being with this company for a long time, initially. "
bad,"This job is growing has low pay, and little hours to offer employees."
bad,"   At Dollar General, a typical day at work is greeting and helping customers. I am always at the register as a cashier helping customers with their purchases and getting things settled for to be on their way. "
bad,As cashier you are to stock too. My experience was way too much to stock and not enough time with the constant flow of customers. Customers would get upset that there was only one cashier.
bad,"I was cashier/sales associate, stocking/arranging shelves, cleaning the store every night. "
bad,"This company does not want real managers, they want babysitters.  The turnover rate is very high."
bad,"greet customers"
bad,A typical day at dollar general is very hectic because there is only two people on the clock at one time. Most of the time I had to help my manager with her tasks as well because it was so much to do in a short amount of time. The thing i enjoyed most about dollar general was that it was my first job and it gave me experience to the work force.
bad,"customer service, learned how to manage and do paper work. hardest part of the job was really nothing at all it was an easy job. i enjoyed working with the public."
bad,"Training was very minimal. Very fast pacedenvironment, management could have been better. "
bad,"They want you to work off the clock because they can't afford overtime. My coworkers were really caring and helpful. It's a dead-end job, though. Working there was pretty easy."
bad,they knew how to make the day go by faster. they knew what they were doing.
bad,There wasn't very many employees working here so I was constantly interupted in my work.
bad,A lot of people I worked with did not do they're job and were very lazy. Very poor management.
bad,"Hiring new emoloyees to join our team. As well as opening and closing the store, deposits, stocking the sales floor"
bad,"Personally I was just glad to have a job, I didn't think the pay was all that great nor were the hours. Most of the people I worked with were much older than I was so that could have had alot to do with it but over all it just was not my favorite job I did learn alot though given it was my first job I learned the basics of working at a store and with people, how to use a cash registar,and how to read the sku number to know where to put things in the proper place."
bad,Loved working there but after the first time they got robbed i was through.
bad,Dollar General is a company that has room for their employees to grow and move up in the company
bad,"working at dollar general was terarizing, just because there were 2 employees that would always grab and try to look down peoples shirts and no one ever did anything about it. the manager wasnt really a manager. He was a young kid that thought he knew everything when he started there but really we all knew more about him. he tried changing the work plans and getting us onto different schedules but that didnt work"
bad,Got back from an excepted request to go out of town with my family to be told I'm not in the system anymore. Very poor management. Witness the manager treat a customer unfairly in store.
bad,"I didn't like it very much but it was a job and when you have bills, you have to do what you have to do."
bad,"Cashier,stock shelves,unload shipment,straighten the shelves.this was the first job I ever did planograms at.I had a good manager.Most of the coworkers except for a few that wanted to do as little as possible.The hardest part of the job was always having enough workers.The most enjoyable part of the job was there was always something to do.So you really had no reason to stand around and be bored."
bad,"I loved working for DG and meeting new people everyday, and I tried my best to along with every employee on a daily basis, but it had it's setbacks in management as I did my very best but it was never good enough. This was just not me however; but I was the one who spoke up about it. Once management got switched over I was terminated two weeks later for a company violation. On what hand I was upset because the manager and I got along well but on the other hand their was nothing I could do. I still question why they waited so long to terminate me but maybe some day I will write the company a letter."
bad,"A typical day at work was cleaning, stocking, greeting customers and waiting on people."
bad,It was part time and only there for a few months but the months i was their i learned bout the company and how the operate on a daily bases.
bad,"A typical day at work would be stocking, helping customers, while checking customers out on the register and making sure the store is kept clean at all times. I learned a lot from working there, my communication skills are much stronger than what they used to be, and I'm now great at multi-tasking. I enjoyed working with my manager and co-workers. The hardest pa goort of the job was saying goodbye to my co-workers and customers who became my second family. The most enjoyable part of the job was seening my customers leave the store with a well pleased face and smile from gtting the best customer service from me"
bad,"The management was chagned shortly after i was hired due to my hiring manager getting hurt in a rock climbing incident. Long story short the new management came from hollywood video after that company closed down, all in all they were treating the current employees and unfair and slowly n surely let each one of us go so they could hire former coworkers from the Hollywood viedo they worked at."
bad,I like the customers and employees because they are nice and make my day enjoyable. I learned how retail works. I did not like the hours because I did not get enough.
bad,In addition to low pay there was a safety and security issue.
bad,"Alot of manual labor, will put in more hours then they tell u. Home office is located several states away.Dealing with the public is always fun. You will meet lots of interesting peoples."
bad,"my review about this place, dont shop there. even though the product are at a bargain price, they're not good. the atmosphere is not very friendly."
bad,Could be a better place to work if they would help their employees more the people that work there are very nice and try to help u it was a very relaxful place to work until it came to your production
bad,"Workplace environment is fair but the pay could be better. A typical work day starts with office work such as scheduling, start task and making sure all money is accounted for. Then you move out to the floor and make sure your front end and back end is recovered and customer ready."
bad,Hours change drastically and very short staffed. Not enough hours given so hard to hire a full staff.Makes it difficult to get tasks done. Being understaffed is my main concern
bad,Pay was salary when I was there. It may have changed by now. Work life balance was bad. They had deadlines that were hard to meet without the manager working 60 hours to fill in the gaps. The bonus program was the worst. No accountability for DC shortages. Once a year auditing is a terrible idea.
bad,"Dollar general was a fast paced job with constant turnover, unrealistic timeframes, minimum pay, minimal if any yearly pay raises, few opportunities to advance, and unfriendly customers. Every employee I ever worked with, as well as every manager I ever worked under made it very clear it was the worst company they'd ever worked for and my experience was similar. A great first job to break into sales and customer service. Wouldn't suggest it as a career."
bad,"Great benifits for part time employees, management was well skilled at her job, there was room for growth within management positions. Choice of day and evening positions great flexibility options for employees with families or other employment."
bad,I enjoyed working there cause by meeting different people and job was easy but didn't pay very well and didn't really get enough hours a week.and I also had to move away for awhile
bad,"Good place to start working as if your like 16, not a place for some one who has big dollar dreams. The job is fair but as a corporation they are tight when it comes to money and promotions."
bad,"Dollar General was an easy job mostly friendly, however only making minimum wage with less than 20 hours a week is nowhere near enough to live on. I loved the people i worked with i just wish there was more of an incentive to work there."
bad,Stores can be poorly managed at times. Very inconsistent work hours depending on managers. Nobody really seems to have everything together at the store at times.
bad,"This was my first job, working as a stocker at first. Hard work and a little luck got me to assistant manager.  It’s hard labor and demanding some times, However I’m a people person and I loved interacting with customers everyday."
bad,I was considered one of the hardest workers I actually enjoyed my job. However the moment we were robbed changed everything for me. There is no security and the district manager did not seem to care.
bad,"I have not worked here that long yet -- but I stay real busy during my time there.  Do cashier duties, stock, recover, customer service, etc.  Need more help because all I do is climb up and down a ladder and never get anything accomplished--- every time I start up I am called back to the register to check out someone"
bad,Dollar general is a job meant for people who’s are starting of form highschool or in college but as a career it is something that is extremely hard to achieve especially with the starting pay for the sales associates
bad,I loved my job but it got very stressful being salary. Some weeks I worked all 7 days while others I could just do 5 days. It is a good job for people who like different settings daily.
bad,Typical day working at Dollar General consist of on certain days  unloading trucks Casper's to work as you work at the cash register you also have to continue to unload your truck and when you get a customer you are to report back to the cash register to ring a customer up  and everything they request me to work at a fast pace when unloading a truck and you also have to set up displays for seasonal events far as holidays if you work night shift and close you do have to mop the floor a 30 minute lunch break easy promotion some location are more busier than other ones do have to watch for customers that are shoplifting because these stores are targeted the most for those criminal activities depend on your location overall the spares okay the paper could be more
bad,"Started out great until winter time hours then hours was cut to 4 hours a day. Other than that they provide on site training, and benifits after. I believe it was a year."
bad,Decent enough retail place to work for. Hours are inconsistent though. You will be scheduled to stay until 10 that night and then scheduled to be there at 5 the next morning. No real overtime was available unless they were short staffed and you are only allowed to work 22 hours when you first start. Management has to get approval from their management to make you full time and even then you may only be scheduled 30-32 hours if that.
bad,I have to work 60 hours to make sure certain things get done. I don't have a dependable staff & this makes the job stressful. The hardest part of the job is staying caught up & that's hard to do when you do not have a dependable staff.
bad,"A typical day of work was not stressful. The team including the manager on duty, tried to make it fun and not so stressful. I have learned a lot about retail work. I have received more social skills. dealing with the public. I have learned how to read labels on the merchandise and what the labels mean (example, sku) . I also learned how to do resets on shelves. I built a good connection to my customers I had every single day, and also built good relationships with other coworkers as well. I learned everything quickly. I would think it is something to start with if you haven't ever done retail work before. I think the most scariest thing when I first started was cashiering. I was nervous to mess money up such as giving too much money back to customers or even not enough money back. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the merchandise."
bad,"A day at dollar general is very stressful. Where we are located is a very busy environment which means rushing ALOT! They are hoping to bump me up to managment, but i dont want to take it because i need a better paying job right now to support my family. The hardest part about working at dollar general is the stocking. Im not food at stalking at all! Trying tl find where a object gies slows me down. Being the cashier is what im good at. When we have a line of customers i love speeding through it all because it makes me feel good."
bad,"I've learned how to great and interact with customers on a daily basis. In a typical day at work I would meet and greet customers at the door, ask them if they need any assistance in finding anything, keeping things clean, and stocking shelves."
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 11 1/2 years as an Asst. Mgr., and is not the best company I ever worked for! You do not get any kind of bonus, or sick pay with the company for the hard work you put into it! When you do your job and you were told you did it right they still take it from you. On the up side you do get vacation pay and insurance after 6 months if your full time!"
bad,"Honestly the worst job I have ever had, was not given time to attend college classes as well as I didn't receive hours because I was a student."
bad,"Great people to work with, not enough associates on a shift. Vulnerable to high theft and possibly robbery. Poor security company doesn't care if it loses money and it's always the workers who are stealing"
bad,"Dollar General is a place meant for a person that do not mind working, do not need much money (part time) or someone who want to make a career out of retail. The pay is low compared to the work you have to do and the time that you spend away from family."
bad,I enjoyed my time at my position during training.  After training it went down.  The management didn't follow their own company rules and regulations.  I strictly follow the rules.  That's why I am no longer employed at this company.
bad,"It's a really great working atmosphere depending on what store you work at. It can sometimes be stress as a stocker cause of lack of equipment compared to other retail stores, but all and all it's a pretty cool job."
bad,pay is min wage.. very little hours at least when i worked there that was like 7 years ago tho. was only part time no benefits.
bad,"A typical day at work was delivering excellent customer service"
bad,typical day was getting to work and going straight to the back and get to stocking. Nothing was really hard about the Job.
bad,I honestly loved Dollar General simply because i had a great manger that always helped me with whatever i had an issue with. i also liked the fact that i stayed busy and able to move around instead of standing in one place.
bad,"I loved working here, it kept me working hard all the time. I left here because of my pregnancy at the time."
bad,needed better management above me. needed more help in bad store i was given.
bad,Started the day around 6am and usually ended around 9pm. Store manager is responsible from the front door to the back door.
bad,I liked working at dollar general wish I could go back I would but I don't think they like to have people that care about the place be there.
bad,"The only issue I had was that I had to wait for a manager all the time when I needed them at the register, so that I could help the customer with whatever they needed. They need to update the registers."
bad,"This is the type of place you work at till you find a ""career"" type of job. They barely payed me anything for being a assistant manager and the raise I received was insulting. Also the policy is very loosely followed which is just asking for trouble. Management can be improved but cooperate would rather not go through the extra hoops to find a new store manager. The store manager who hired me is really nice, but does not know how to  put her foot down and I am so glad I left. The pay was enough to get by on, but not enough to not get off government assistance."
bad,If your working as a manager do not expect to have a life outside of your job.  I was averaging 60-70 hours per week with one day off.  Payroll hours are to short to work a full crew and allow you time to be with your family.
bad,It was nice to work in my home town dollar general the only thing bad about working there was the different people and people taking stuff from the store..
bad,The pay wasnt worth the work I put in. As an assistant manager and a working mother.  Customers were always rude and I felt like a lesser than to many individuals because that's how I was treated. If the pay was better I wouldn't have hesitated to return to the retail chain.
bad,Dollar general is a well set company but in my opinion it underpays all positions. I think it should pay more for all positions from the sale Associate to the store manager. I think everyone is very underpaid working here. Dollar general makes plenty of money it should show more gratitude to the one that are bring in the money for them. Not just the people in the workplace in the store and warehouses.
bad,"Managers have to work 6 days mandatory and generally work over 60 hours/week. No real training before you start. Salary is decent, but you get stuck working all the time to cover other people's shifts."
bad,"I worked really hard, most of the time i was in there by myself. Running register and helping customers. Well i was stil expected to put away stock. no one to cover register or for lunch. I was in there most days by myself."
bad,"My boss and coworkers were nice, respectful, and hard workers. They never were disrespectful. I got along and liked about 99.9999% of customers. Good benefits were offered and store had good prices, great card selection, discount sales, and neat seasonal merchandise for sale. I appreciate that they had a 10% discount sale for military and veterans recently."
bad,Different treatment for employees. The ppl were good. Sexual harrassment cases. No team organization. Forget breaks. No help when needed. Poor shelving stuff on the floor. I did my best there
bad,Hard job good pay have to all way keep in motion to hit rate they ask to hit 100% If u over exceed 100% a day u get paid for the min ur over. TRY IT .
bad,How do u get your work done when cashiers call off over and over on truck day and you are the mgr running register all day and all night while truck sits there. Then dust mgr hires an asset for you and he stinks so bad that no one wants to work with him. He was a poor performer stank had skin lesions and greasy hair ended up steeling from the company. Constant being yelled at my dist mgr about getting work done no staff no hours no pay for good employees and I hear it in all Dg stores. I really wanted it to work but got exhausted.
bad,"stocking the floor checking customers out, learned how multitask hardest part was nothing most enjoyable was meeting each of my customers goals everyday"
bad,Complete lack of distribution of managers from the district manager. I loved working there despite that because of my customers.  Which made my job alot bearable.
bad,"customers always made my day, but employees were cut throats. two faced. I learned how to be a PT lead which I enjoyed. Management was sometime it. we had different backgrounds employed with us."
bad,"Fun job to have !! Advancement is an option early. Flexible work schedule. One day you can close and the very next day you can open. Work every weekend and holiday besides christmas day. Holidays do pay like overtime. Only dislike would be the particular manager at the store, she makes the schedule around her personal life with weekends off in the summer time for camping, you are told to give notice when you need off as early as possible but if it interferes with her camping days she will tell you tuff luck. She doesn't have any respect for other employees necessities when it comes to working a Saturday in the summer. Outside of that i love working at Dollar General but with the amount of disrespect when it comes to 1 time, i have to move on. I would recommend working at Dollar General to a friend, with a different store manager."
bad,"stock, count money, talk to customers,"
bad,"I was fired from dg, due to the store opening late. Based on the schedule that was posted I was doing my job. My manager did my have the correct schedule up at the time I closed the store the night before and when I got to work I was fired. And she lied to me about how much I was going to be paid person hour."
bad,We come into and distribute freight to the empty shelves. Then we help customers for majority of the day. Helping them find items they can't find and or can't reach
bad,If you are able to make DG your life then this is the job for you.  The work/life balance does not exist.  The workload is unbearable and it grows daily....
bad,"A typical day of work for myself consists of every aspect of operations from cleaning all the way to management of the store. I have learned many valuable traits in this position that will assist in future employment ventures, my co-workers are all very hard working dedicated individuals and I enjoy my time with them. Management in my particular district is a challenge for myself as well as many others; lack of interest in employees as individuals and not just employee identification numbers hinders ones respect for the company. The hardest part of my job is the inability to complete my degree or enjoy free time with my family due to 24/7 demands of this particular industry. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I encounter daily both counter-parts and customers alike. I enjoy interaction with people and the insights that follow."
bad,Dollar General is a difficult company to work for. The pay is minimal and a tremendous work load.  A lot of turnover within the company at store level. Always training personnel. With a stable team makes the job more enjoyable and productive.
bad,had to open the store and get all the tills ready for the day.Went to the bank to make the depost from the day before. I stocked the shelfs managed all the employes. I learned alotabout the coustomer.i was the asst manager. there was not any thing hard. going to work everday was very enjoyable.
bad,very slow at times managers aren't the nicest and customers are very rude.
bad,"Mgr. Was great, coworkers awesome. GM rude, unorofessional and verbally abusive to employees in front of customers. Customers comolained about him. I was a keyholder and enjoyed position, ended up leaving because of GM."
bad,Its a hard job to have on the day you arrive to work not knowing how long you will be there things change EVERY day the uncertanity is hard
bad,"A typical day at work involves numerous multitasking,taking care of customers while answering phone calls as well as the day to day business. Management could use some improvement as far as schedueling and training. The co-wprkers are a great group of people to work with. the haredst part of the job would be dealing with customers who that are aggrivated. the most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and actually being appreciated for it."
bad,"Honestly, it is more headache than it is worth. If you are in a good area, it may be different. But I end up seeing the dregs of society at the one I work at, and it is beyond pleasant."
bad,My review for this job would be overall a good review. My time spent here was enjoyable. The pay is not very good and I think that they should pay more for the people that hold more responsibility.
bad,Doesn't pay enough.. Work you to death and insurance is way too expensive. Not a very good company to work for. Let Dollar General be a last resort for employment if you can
bad,The customers are local drugies and drug dealers. They steal and destroy the store faster than new management can keep up. I witnessed help being called in and improvements did not last. Lost 6 crew members all in 1 week. Huge set back. Dollar General? Great! Location? Terrible! Good Luck!
bad,"My current store follows the guidelines of the dollar general policy all while having fun. However I recently worked at a dollar general close to us where the manager did nothing and employees were expected to know what to do on their own, even if you have only worked there for a few days"
bad,"Day in and day out, working at Dollar General is fine. The basis of what we do every day is basically the same, work on the register, usually by yourself, until a sales associate comes in to relieve your register duties. Then continue to do whatever it may be that we need done that night. Since we cannot do any sort of stocking past 5:00p, we have to find other things to do. Every night we will do what we call recovery and that is making sure everything is in their correct spot and everything is neat and pulled forward. Others things we may do is reset shelves, pull excess u-boats from out back to make sure alcohol coolers are filled, and of course manage the front area."
bad,"Was a decent place to learn and get your foot in the door as far as jobs go. I learned how to match codes with products to restock and scan them to get a price match to make sure it was the right product. I used a register but not to consistent, spent more time stocking I feel like than anything. Hardest part is finishing stock before you close and having to check people out knowing you have a lot of product on the floor, but I did enjoy the fast pace when I had to and now a days it doesnt bother me at all."
bad,"I generally enjoy my job at the Dollar General I work at. BUT,the rude customers and the management can be incredibly overbearing. That's to be expected of a job in the service industry though. To their credit they are good about working with a changing schedule,as well my coworkers are good people."
bad,trash management and trash stores. poorly taken care of . employees do not follow instruction. security system is so whack that anyone could steal from any store at any time and it's a shame
bad,good to work for mangers are great pay is great  and breaks are great I like it I like it I like it would go back people that worked there are great to
bad,"It will be a great place if you were paid decent, and given better hours to make money employees and management are friendly, and value their customers"
bad,this job is for a teenager without responsibility. the pay is little of nothing and if you have dependents move past. the hours i was giving were barely enough to sustain my vehicle with fuel.
bad,i love it ' it's nice to work there . i love the coworker i like how it's very understood and organized . i wouldn't mind working there again
bad,a typical day a dollar general was not bad the hours were not set. the manager i was under was fair and very hard working. the hardest part of my job was getting screamed at by customers i would catch shoplifting.
bad,The work place was a good environment for work but the management was a joke a cashier should not have to do their work for them and if they do the should get at least a raise
bad,"I enjoy my customers each and everyday at Dollar General. It is such a relaxed environment that my shift goes by so quick. I have been under management for over a year. My two months of starting in retail, I received a promotion for a manager (key holder) position. Four months after, I was promoted as an Assistant Manager. We have a wonderful team and we all participate in teamwork. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we all get along and our customers give us great credit on our work ethics and the store."
bad,In order to keep up with everything they ask it takes a manager to work 10 to 12 hours a day
bad,When working here I learned how to get better at what I do in life the life that I had working here was good.
bad,Got in an car accident and they made me work the next day they made me work by myself for over three hrs. I had to manage a whole store by myself. To the point I was the manager
bad,"I was SO happy for the chance to be working there; to be able to move up to store manager and then district manager, but all of that came crashing down like a landslide. I felt lied to by the company false job posting(s) that is on-going on sites, such as Indeed. The company claimed to have three positions available in MOST of their stores - sales associate, lead/key holder that is either full-time and part-time. Well,........ got the interviewed, got the job offer, liked the manager, did all of the paper work...... UNTIL I was given my schedule. All of sudden, from asking the manager and being told BY the manager that I would like the part-time lead position (20 to 24 hours a week), to being told that my position would be a VERY VERY part-time sales associate who will only work 12 hours a week...........??? Ha, come again....??? At 12 hours a week and at $10.00 an hour, do the math after you subtract taxes, phone bill, gas and other fees to be paid. "
bad,"The manager is awesome she worked well with you when you need days or hours off. It’s nerve racking when your trying to stock shelves and run a cash register at the same time, There is only 2 people in the store and at times the manager is by themselves doing it all. The hours for part time is good but Dollar General needs to pay better, especially for all the work the cashiers do. It’s not like other store where your just a cashier or stocker your doing it all"
bad,"When I worked for Dollar General in Taneytown, the manager was lousy. Information was constantly missing, and when I asked the manager where something was she commonly replied ""find it yourself"" as if she had no clue. I'm not sure who is running the management position now, it could be someone else or the same sub-par manager. If you know what you're doing however (such as knowing where things properly belong) then the place is worth working for, but the mediocre simplicity even then may render you desiring an alternate job."
bad,Dollar Generals an good place to work for a first job. But the hours as well as the pay isn't so pleasant. We get paid weekly but barely get hours. The work that's done doesn't match the payment that's received.
bad,"its a good place to work"
bad,I enjoyed working for the company. Its always room for career advancement. Its a good company benefits were good. I would recommend this company to anyone.
bad,Go in at 7:00 am count petty cash and get tills ready for the day.  Update all paper work from the day before.  Open the store at 8:00 am.  I love working with the public.
bad,It was a nice environment friendly staff and customers not very clean but the managers were strict and kept everybody in task the stocking was a lot but it wasn't so bad  it gave me a lot to do
bad,it was a ok job good at teaching responsibility and making customers happy great with dealing with money and coupons all around a good job to work at as a second job
bad,good place to work. management was good. fair working conditions.
bad,"The job only has 3 workers per shift including the manager! Sometimes it would be 2 employees among one shift..  The store was very nasty, I cleaned as hard as I could to save it. It’s just the lazy workers!"
bad,"Working at Dollar general made we want more than they had to offer..The longer I worked there the more I didnt have much of a life outside of work,which normally I wouldnt care if I was getting paid enough to do so.Dollar General only cares about the money they make rather than their employees."
bad,"I enjoy my time working there and with the people I worked with. "
bad,I worked hard every day to make sure everyone was happy and doing what was necessary for each day. I lost my job due the lack of communication between corporate and lesser staff. They do not send out updated policies and such. My co-workers were the best people to work with and I am glad I had the opportunity to work with them.
bad,This was a great job for me. It was part time.and only for the holidays.i needed more cash to get by with the holidays coming. I loved working there and I miss it.
bad,As a asm at dollar general I have learned a lot as a leader. You got to be there when no ones there. Its a great job
good,If you plan on applying in the wrens location don't waste your time. You don't get hours one week you might get decent hours the next you don't. Don't waste your time. Some of the the employees are great to work with but I wouldn't recommend working here it's just gonna become a waste of gas and people wonder why they arw anyways hiring it's because you don't get hours and so everyone leaves so
good,If your a student or someone looking for a part time job to earn extra money & don’t have to depend on your salary to maintain your household then try it.
good,Could have been better management. Unfairly treated. Drama just didnt feel respected at all. Wanted to run the store and stock and register an check vendors in with just u on duty
good,I wish there was more of a positive outlook and organization. The town dose really need a produce section but it’s always a hassle to just get milk an eggs out here.
good,I enjoyed working with the public meeting new people. I really loved my job but the management team is poor. The pay is not worth all the work you put in.
good,"I love the work, very strenuous and fast paced but only 2 people per shift, not enough time for people to get all done that needs to be done in a shift"
good,Not good. They have no interest in anything u have personally doing on. Not a good company if u need time off. Pay is not competitive with other companies in the area
good,"I only worked there a short time. I tried to take some time off but was not allowed to. I only worked like 15 hours a week, I'm not sure why it was a issue. But besides that it was a good job"
good,Dont ever work at this place if you are a parent. You HAVE to work all holidays and if you dont you will loose your job (first hand experience cause I didnt want to work thanksgiving even though I requested off AND worked the previous holiday as per agreement)
good,The store had you clock out but still work after you clocked out and didmt want to pay their employees for the overtime and coperation amd head honchos didnt want to pay
good,"Unorganized, low staffed and an attitude if you call out for emergencies. You don't get paid as much as you should for all you at required to do. I plan on finding a new job soon."
good,"Unreasonably high expectation with no support.  Store managers"
good,This job was great whilst I was employed here. Enjouable. I was able to meet more of the people that lived in the same area as myself. I was able to learn more about working at a smaller chain store such as that compared to Walmart.
good,"Just a neutral experience, being my first job. My store was located outside a trailer park, so seeing the same people was pretty cool but I only got to work once a week."
good,a typical day at work would be Lines Backed up manager doesn't try to help yells at you for not moving the line and quick breaks no discounts PTO or anything.  I learned not everyone deserves the position there in and at this job it wasn't what u knew it was who you knew. the most enjoyable part was the customers
good,"My experience in the work place was a good one. The first time I worked for them and the second. But the third time the manager had her favorites, she played favorites. Not good for business."
good,Underpaid overworked no appreciation does not care about employees and the open door policy is a joke they will fire you for turning in a manager for stealing and not showing up to work
good,Staff all had hidden agendas there was no real team work veteran staff took advantage of the new guys making them do all the work while they shopped or put things of trash away to take home
good,Overworked for low wages...... small work staff to save dollar general company money management and supervisored by ppl with low self esteem to get the product sold
good,"always blamed for things there were not my fault "
good,"District Managers are inconsistent from district to district. Mine was horrid. He was a racist, disliked any one who did not fit his standard of a good person. He was unfair to those with minor disabilities and favored the 'pretty girls'. Corporate didn't care when you complained on behalf of your employees and after you did it became a hostile work environment, from the District Manager."
good,"Great job, just didn't work out with my current living circumstances. Had to relocate suddenly and management at the time wasn't very stable...it was like being in high school."
good,"This was my first job, didn't care for it. It gave me experience and that was what I needed. Everyone has to start somewhere, so you take what you can get."
good,I do not recommend working here if you have a family.
good,It depends on who you are and how far up your managers butt to determine how many hours you get. Most of my coworkers were fairly nice it was just when the real manager left the key holder or manager on duty would be slacking on her work and expected me to do both of our jobs. It’s really too many responsibilities that come with the job especially if you’re on nights you must clean& recover the store not to mention the basket and sidewalk sales that have to be brought back into the store. $8.50 isn’t enough for all the back breaking work done here. Then you don’t get discounts on top of that. And when corporate comes they are some of the rudest people I’ve ever met.
good,dollar general is a wonderful place unfortunately the corporation is more inclined to put profits over people and grind there good people into the ground until they move on. no employee loyalty at all
good,Dollar General was an okay place to work but the pay wasn't the greatest it was barely enough to live on even though the pay was weekly for the amount of work they want you to do while trying to take of the customers isnt worth working there for 7.25
good,Never knew how many hours you were scheduled to work each day until u came into work and they disclosed the volume for the day. Started out working 10-12 hrs per day and by fall that fell down to 5-6 hrs per day. Basically went from a FT position to a PT position due to production needs.
good,I have never like to work in Retail because it's not challenging enough for me. I need to be able to do different things and also need growth in my experience so I can grow the company. I am looking forward to working where I can move up.
good,"Had to wait til thursday or Friday before the Saturday schedule was posted.  No paid time off. And no medical time paid off.  Hours are long, management is sad.  Major bully and lets you know that even if you are in a lead job or ASM you are not allowed to tell people what is to be done on the shift."
good,"The Dollar General on N Siwell Rd in Jackson, MS is a disgrace. The store manager and the district manager need to be replaced. They hire their friends so they can chill and hang out at work & leave everyone else struggling. Most of the employees (if any) are rude and trifling. Would not recommend anyone with their brain screwed on tight to work at that specific store. Dollar General in general is a semi decent company to work with."
good,"It's a fast pace environment with great demands of its employees. I enjoyed working there but am overworked and under paid for the amount of work that is required. I not only do my job, but have to pull slack from the store manager."
good,Manager was very unprofessional in her workplace would not work for her again  Manager will talk about you behind your back to other employees she backstabbed you and you just could not do anything right for her.  She was very rude to the customers and to her employees she was just very unprofessional and does not need to be in that line of work
good,If you have a family this is not the company for you!!!  no benefits for anyone only managers!!!!!  There is high expectations with little hours give in. poor pay
good,They had a high turn over rate and poor management. There is no room for growth or advancement there.  There no set schedule and the schedule was always subject to change with no notification.
good,I learned to always have a positive mind set while working in a busy environment. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing you helped customers with a positive attitude.
good,"Dollar general is a fair company to work for, they offer good training and opportunity for advancement. They work around appointments, second jobs and school schedules"
good,Upper management has favorites if you are not one get treated different . Bad work schedule. Not enough pay. Poor working conditions
good,Employees are expected to do too much for what they are being paid and enough people are not scheduled to work and in summer time the store is too hot to work in.
good,Rather not review this company. My experience working here was not all so pleasant. As for I was a full-time student working.
good,co workers have to much drama. but the company is very organized; its pretty busy but needs more then one cashier. make sure everything is in place
good,a typical day a dollar general it would sometimes be busy or sometimes it would be slow depending on the days. we would have truck days on the weekend and on Thursday so when truck day would come will we be stocking and putting items on the shelf. my co-workers was awesome i love them a lot because we was always on the same page.
good,"The schedule for the start of the week(Saturday) was made the night before on Friday so there was never any time to really plan for your own life. People constantly called off, showed up late, or just wouldn't show up at all. I would be left to deal with customers by myself for hours at a time while other employees took constant smoke breaks."
good,"The daily work in this place is repetitive , always doing the same thing over and over again something not unusual but the stocking side of the job is something that wil make you have fun as also something that help you understand how the retail store work from inside, and this is how you learn how the retail store bigger or smaller work and its pretty intresting how they could be useful after you change a job or retailing, the managment is never too worry about the associates, but they do their job as supervising and making the people work, the co-workers is not that much of people and sometimes that could be something that makes you bored but the hard part is to be able to have the time with scheduels sometimes they dont respect school or even an important event. The enjoying part as i said is the stocking cause you learn more about how to work with the people in a retail store."
good,Is allright for what they paid. Start on Wed unloading truck to be put up on the sales floor. Work from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. Then come back at 10. pm work until 7.00 am stocking shelves.
good,"You were looked at to do both cashiering, stocking the shelves and handling customer services. It was very stressful and not a lot of fun."
good,"Had no support from district, had to work open to close for 9 weeks with no breaks, no lunch or anything Working 120 a week but only getting paid for 40hr"
good,"The work conditions were poor. During the hot summer in Texas, we were forced to work while the air conditioner was broken. They expect you to put away 30 totes full of merchandise that are in different areas of the store while also solely operating the cash register. If you didn't have a certain amount of customers or basket sizes in a day, you received written disciplinary action."
good,An okay place to work and the people are great to work with. You meet a lot of people that just come in the store
good,"the hardest part of the job was stocking the store and checking out customers. i didn't like job at all. not enough hours was giving"
good,"my workdays there were enjoyable, enjoyed working with customers both calm and irate customers"
good,*worked so hard for little pay.
good,Long term employees not willing to cooperate with new assistant manager and sadly upper management did absolutely nothing about it.
good,"This company is one i would not reccomend to anyone. This company only cares about the bottome line..i.e, the sales. They work their employee unreasonably and are uncarring about there health. they do not provide safty equipment for employee to be able to do there job correctly. They never have enough employees on shift to attend to customers nor the store."
good,i love working with people. helping people is what i like. my manager is great. the employees i work with are great.
good,"clock in at 5 am to stock merchandise, take 15 min break at 7 am to put my childre on the school bus, clock back in at 7:15 am to finish stocking and open store by 8 am. run cash register and stock front shelves for the remainder of the day. I enjoyed the people i worked with, but did not enjoy having to work the cash register everyday"
good,A typical day here was easy and enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed working with the public. I enjoyed seeing new items and setting planograms. Player of favorites. Too much night work. Not enough rotation of off days
good,"Underappreciated, lied too, broken promises, asked to work for cash off the clock, never compensated for trips to the bank while off the clock, Store Manager got away with murder around the store and we did her job constantly but they got the bonuses when it  should've been evenly disbursed between lower ranked employees who did all of the grunt work."
good,The few months I worked here we had terrible or no managers and there was zero work ethic. Nobody cared to do anything but the new manager is fair. It was mediocre at best.
good,You are made to work your butt off and when you call out one time in 7 months they fire you! You help out and take anyone shift and the way they pay you back it fire you or take your hours and give you less.
good,"Good clean environment, but not getting enough hours to cover gas and other expenses and bills. Didn't really get taught anything until I asked questions."
good,"Working at Dollar General was an interesting experience for me. My time there, I enjoyed working there. My co-workers and managers were nice people, we knew how to work as a team to keep the store running smoothly."
good,it was a good place to work at first but after while all the responsibility that should be the store managers falls onto the Asst Managers shoulders and you don't get recognized for the things you do or the time you have to give up being with your family.
good,"It was stressful and full of drama,hopefully there are new mangers and employees there now. No one stayed there longer and not all but some mangers pointed fingers at cashiers and not themselves or other mangers."
good,Loved working with the public! The company demands TOO MUCH without giving SMGRS manhours- perfect stores are expected but rarely able to be met without SMS working 80-90 without OT PAY.
good,"Alot of favouritism, biased, and comments made in the store was very rude. Unprofessionalism. No guidance and even when guidance was given; employees acted very unprofessional and rude. Drama, back-stabbing on many as well as employees talked about customers. Everyone thought everyone was stealing. "
good,"Dollar General was not the job for me, it was slow paced and i worked late nights. I learned pretty much how to keep the store cleaned and stocked. Checking and cashing out customers was self explanatory and pretty easy. The hardest part of my job was how slow it got during the late nights, I personally couldn't handle it anymore."
good,Like before depends on who you are working under. Store 5401 was not a very safe and secure environment. Manager never wanted to work. It was always one excuse after another
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was the customers and my employees. The hardest part of the job was the constant over load of merchandise they wanted out cluttering the store. The company wouldn't be so awful to work for, if they actually listened and cared about their employees. Upper management; Regional and above fixate on the needs improvement areas and never the accomplished."
good,"Co-manager was good, Main manager was a bit distracted with everything, manager swapped a little over halfway through my time there, previous manager just up and left one afternoon during a shift"
good,"I started working there with a manager that everyone loved and the whole team worked well, she transferred to another store and they hired from outside instead of moving up someone in store. Then the new manager only gave hours to workers she liked. The company isn't that bad to work for, but they need to check up on employees under managers to see if there are problems. Too many companies don't acknowledge the workers under their management team."
good,It was honestly not the best job. i mean yeah it’s a job but you should never feel uncomfortable in a work environment & that’s how it is here. it sucks. so i don’t recommend it
good,I loved my job at dollar general however my boss was very unprofessional as she would text me rude texts if I didn't come in when someone called in when that is what she is paid for. They expect so much out of you with no rewards or praise. I was fulltime getting 10-20 hours a week. There is no balance with hours. Sometimes I would get 40+ and other times it would be 10 hours a week. It really depended on if I came in for call ins. If not then she would short me hours.
good,was fun to work there at first then they start to cut my hour down to one day a week and changed the schedule on people. meet the customer was a nice thing but some employee was not so nice.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know your customer."
good,"Working for this company is okay, but the hours and the pay I can not live off of with two children. Dollar Genral only pays $7.25 an hour and they only give maybe 22 hours a week the most. I think it is unfair."
good,"You meet nice customers and the dealing with rude ones, Hard work for low pay and little hours, working at the registers, stocking, cleaning, but had some good times, poor management."
good,It’s not too bad of a place to work. It all depends on who you have as a manager and the area your working in. They just don’t pay enough for me to live off on.
good,"I liked working here for the most part, but some employees like to talk about others and the managment was rude when it was not nessasery. I would only work here if I were a teenager again."
good,Management easy to work with.   Enjoyed working with other associates.  Learned alot about small box companies.  Learned about delivery routines.  Working truck quite demanding.
good,Employee works there tails off for little pay. You have to do everything unload the boxes and containers clean the whole store including the bathrooms and mop and then get paid nothing.
good,"Fast paced job"
good,"Dollar General had an incredible problem with motivation of all their employees including but not limited to the management. On three different occasions my job was threaten by others mistake, and on even more occasions I had to physically pay my manager because she claimed my drawer was short cash."
good,The Dollar General I worked at lacked professional managers. I liked my job at Dollar General and I would have stayed with the company but it was to much poor management there.
good,"It was impossible to get a transfer to a store closer to my home, my paychecks were barely enough to support my son let alone pay my bills, and the management team was not very friendly or professional with neither customers nor employees."
good,"Pay is awful, no room for advancement, manager never worked around my college schedule and expected me to miss my college classes for work. The work/life balance was awful, I never had time for my college classes."
good,"I believe that working together with a team is just that, A TEAM. However, at the store I worked, team members were not that at all. I was hard to keep a positive attitude."
good,"Keyholders are often told to work off the clock during breaks,  not paid for bank runs. Not a great anti theft protocol.  The company doesn't like dealing with internal store relations,  not giving out ample store hours for employees to get the work done during the week."
good,"I would recommend to a friend to shop and to work there. It's a Very, easy, simple job. Not much to do and never stressful, Good prices, i would end up working there again."
good,"Im gonna be as blunt as I can and honest. There is no work life balance if your salaried you are expected to work 55-70 hours per week. There is nothing like getting a phone call from your DM stating you have to cut ten hours from your stores budget on a FRIDAY. (Keep in mind friday is the last day of the pay period, which runs from sat. To the following friday) . As a salaried employee only way to shave the hours was to call your closing manager and tell him or her not to come in and work the extra hours on top of your mandatory 55 hours. The store hour budget is ridiculous..my store for example was only budgeted to receive 140 per week. Lets do some basic math here:"
good,"Most of the time we worked in a very unsafe environment. Stealing and robbing would happen often and the manager did not care. Once when  asked if he could hire a male from protection he said, ""Why so they can get assaulted?""."
good,working at dollar general wasn't bad.i just didn't like how the hrs were cut without any explanation.i didn't receive benefits because I worked very few hoursmy manager was very late usually and got an attitude when asked questions so it made tension at our workplace.
good,"A typical day of work can be relaxing and fast paced at the same time, but I would reccommend that you have two people in the store every shift so task can be completed as assigned per store manager. Most enjoyable part of the job is making sure customers are happy,"
good,Not many hours to give out and to many employees to juggle injoyed my time as a cashier and stocker good learning experience but not enough hours to make a living
good,"A lot of issues with management, taking advantage of employees, Favoritism with certain employees, hard workers get hours cut, threatened of the clock by management."
good,The manger was out with an injury so it was pretty much a free fall no one did anything.. They ladies talked negatively about each other behind their backs it was a petty unorganized place
good,"Rude and Unprofessional manager i.e. Face Piercings and Tongue Rings"
good,"Was a very stressful place to work, A lot of rude customers.  Too much inventory not enough space to put the stuff.  Hard to keep the store clean with the amount of product that had to be displayed."
good,The store i worked at had poor management and did not care much that i had an infant at home and did not appreciate me working 50-60 hours a week. i worked multiple double shifts and did not get appreciation for it at all. Also worked my birthday and unloaded a truck and got no appreciation for it.
good,This is my first job i have had. I would not recommend working in a management postion here. Your breaks arr always interrupted but the location also matters.
good,working at dollar general was fairly easy.  there are set tasks to do.  It is a team job.  everyone has a part and needs to do their part for it to work.
good,"store managers are allowed one day off. When associates call-out, you are required to still run your store. Can easily work 80hrs weekly if you aren't staffed"
good,"Its a great place to work as long as you have a strong team and your store manager is 100%. But if you have a fully staffed store you dont get many hours. Some of the customers can be rude, but thats anywhere. Then you have the DM's where most of them NEVER worked in a store so they don't know how to run things, but will tell you how to do your job!"
good,It's some what a good job my main concern was coming in gettin too work and at the end of my shift making sure what I was told to do is done and everything is recoverd
good,"This company works you to the bone. Not enough hours for employees to help stock shelves, not enough people who apply really care about doing a good job.  They overwork you, with little pay."
good,"I liked this job for the soul reason of having weekly pay. I have children I must consider before I work long hours and they seemed inconsiderate to that ,"
good,If I had the proper help it would not be as stressful as it is I do not get a day off ever even if I try I end up on the phone with my store at least 5 times a day I can't even have a sick day or get a break to get over being sick
good,Employee's calling in sick all the time. The manager is never there no more than 2 hours. I learned that all employee's should be held accountable for their actions. Management will not answer the phone when they are not at the company. I don't understand how the corp office allows the district managers nor the store mangers to get away with how the store looks and is being ran. The culture in the company is horrible. The hardest part of working there was dealing with other employee's who did not do their jobs and management does not do anything about it. The most enjoyable part of working there was meeting new customer's and helping them out in anyway I could.
good,Don't get many days off. Management takes most of the holidays off so you're stuck working and they don't close early for holidays. Very limited family time
good,The co- workers I had were great. we were like a little family. we had great regular customers. I did not feel like management support their employees.
good,"Its an easy enough job. Manage cashier, keep store clean and looking good, help customers."
good,I like my job . And the costomers are good people . I do my best to help them find and care for their families. I keep my store nice and clean for them .
good,"I could of loved this job, but everything always seemed scattered. Always changing shelfs and seasonal stuff. The changes weren't bad just not organized like they could be, I understand rearranging and moving stuff I loved the idea and gave us something to do, my manager was to worried about himself for anyone to ask question or give our opinions on things."
good,"typical day is having to do someone else's job because of poor management. your co-workers will most likely consist of someone lazy, someone that's a hard worker and someone that is just rude to the customers. hardest part is trying to get everything done each day because there is usually only two people working at a time. most enjoyable is maybe meeting new people. I didn't really learn anything."
good,On a typical day there was always plenty to do because the backroom of stock was always overflowing. I learned many things there. I would have liked to work there longer.
good,"as the summary says, they are usually very understaffed meaning your working every day the process of how they get stuff done is very flawed they block off aisles to customers, Management is snobby. acts like they dont need to actually work. had lines going to the back of the store only one person checking them out while the manager sat on their butt in the office, your day off you had to be ready to get called in."
good,we are a company that loves to work and keeps smiles on our customers face when they come in the door from them leaving out the doors and give the a good quality item for a reasonable price
good,"Little pay, very demanding job, they try not to allow you to go over a set amount of hours so that you aren't able to receive benefits. It is fast paced and you have to learn quick, great for a first job if you can get it, but personally I wouldn't make it a life time job, although many of the employees had. They are typically very friendly and family like but as with any family, favorite people over rule all. My first time asking for a weekend off in nearly a year I was told ""You will have to wait and if no one else asks than yes."" This was very upsetting, we have a wall in the office where everyone left notes for days they needed off, all of my coworkers had asked time after time for days off, and I focused on work, covering for everyone else because food on the table was more important than R&R yet the newest employees are be putting above me."
good,I liked working here because it was right around the corner from where I lived. I also liked working here because I got to see everyone in town
good,All I want to say about my time at Dollar General is the woman running it is a terrible manager. I was fired through text message. Then put me in the system as if I quit. Over all I loved working with the public and loved my job. Pay is decent if you can get the hours.
good,"At DG, I spent my day by assisting customers by helping them locate an item/s they may be looking for. I also assist them by waiting on them at the check out counter. When the business was slow I spent my time cleaning and stocking merchandise."
good,"Going into working with Dollar General I was very excited. I hadn't had a job in almost a year and I was ready to get back on my feet. Since my start in January, the employees and management had done a downward spiral. We lost our manager and several employees were fired or left because of the stress. My position at the time was a Sales Associate getting paid $9.15 and hour and I was forced to work 40+ hours a week because of lack of employees. When we finally got another manager, the hours cut back a little, which was a good break. As the months continued, I watched the staff i started with disappear. Many of them left because they were unhappy with the stressful work environment. By July, every single crew member was gone that i\I had started with and the manager was beginning to create a whole new team. Between the months of July and October, I saw many people come in for interviews, but barely any were being hired. My manager had broken her hand and had left on LOA twice within the last month and was unable to hire anymore employees while on her leave. Employees began to leave again, in the stressful situation. I quit October 22nd when it came down to just another cashier and myself being the only two employees."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed my time working with this company, they gave me a chance when nobody else would. Starting out the management was awesome as well as my coworkers. Over time though things went down hill very quickly. My store went over a month without an official store manager so it was up to my coworkers and one assistant manager to keep the store running until they brought in a new store manager."
good,"This was the least likeable job I had. I wasn't paid correctly, not much I can say about this place. Just that It wasn't for me at all"
good,"The hardest part of the job is having to be very flexible on hours while having to work your hardest and not get the proper compensation. It is very straight forward customer service so being able to handle a variety of people is a must. This includes the Management, which will most likely be a catty female who constantly gossips.  There is a risk of robbery and if this occurs, the company doesn't console you. The most enjoyable part of the job is having return customers who truly enjoy seeing you."
good,not much money to be made lack of hours and hard to work with people not a job reccomended for anyone
good,it was a  ok job not much to really say typical reatil job some room for advancement but in the hood general manager was a good guy looked out for his employees
good,work all the time for everyone else but no one can cover me when i need to be off. get like no hours and dont make like any money
good,"I worked for dollar general once in 4/01-8/01 in Greenville, MS and then again in 4/03-4/04 North Richland Hills, TX. We lost our manager in North Richland Hills because of inventory issues. I was left to open and close the store for business. I did not get a promotion or anything. I was still making 6.25 per hours. I felt used and taking advantage of. When they finally got a store manager she was not willing to let me continue to go to school while working. I end up transferring to a new store location."
good,"Most of the customers were a pleasure and employees also but you always have the few rotten eggs of the bunch. For the pay that most of us received we shouldn't have been working as hard, and as long as we were."
good,"Store Manager over shoulder all the time always saying you had a final warning every time you didn't get something done. The worse strategies for stocking if you didn't put out merchandise on there time you were fired, as for closing expecting Manager to put out adds at 7 OVER 200 ADDS TO PUT OUT  and recover store with one cashier when store closes at 9,when things go wrong in the store like the air conditioner made us sign a waver saying we was going to stay hydrated took to in a half months to fix air General manger talked to managers like dogs never encouraging down talking other employees cut part timers hours being cut forcing the key holders to work strange hours. SAYING YOU WILL GET OVER TIME IF WORKED AT ANOTHER STORE ONLY TO FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE STORE YOU WORK AT THE STORE MANAGER CUT YOUR HOURS. Lie about advancements in the company never satisfied with progress that's been made always finding something else to complain about and say ""if you don't fix it you will be a customer"""
good,"You just come in and work, there is no kind of learning to advance your self their. Some people are nice to work with, most are not."
good,"I've been with DG for 8 years now. I've certainly learned alot about management and how to deal with customers and employees. On a typical day, I check in most vendors and oversee cashiers. I set plan o grams and count down tills at the end of shifts.I also deal with deposits on the managers off days including going to the bank. Stocking is hard sometimes but the worst part of the job is working the crazy schedule and the low compensation. I really enjoy helping my customers and have learned most of them by name after being assistant store manager at this particular store for 5 years. "
good,"Some of the staffing were easy to work with. there is a high turn over rate with this company. they accuse people of things they done do and black list them when they fire you, which hurts your job hunting ability there after. Some of the stores are defiantly easier to work at that others. The company has some crazy policies and corporate doesn't give stores enough hours to handle the work load."
good,"It's like a big social game to every store manager. I've worked at several locations in Virginia and Florida and both places are ridiculous. Had it not been for my district manager in Virginia, I would not have stayed with the company as long as I did. But he gave me chances and watched me excel. He was the only person in the company willing to do so. No matter how hard I worked under anyone else, all they cared about was getting their friends and family hired with the company. Sorry but I don't have time for that."
good,Management isnt very nice and wont work with you on schedule. Hours are low.
good,"I was a cashier and I enjoyed meeting the different types of people. There was nothing to learn from this job, and management at the time was great. I to this day still speak with the co-workers I had at that period in time. The hardest part of this job was standing for long hours even after store hours were over. The most enjoyable was being off every weekend."
good,I have 17 years plus of cashier experience /3 years customer service experience / I was once called a valuable employee I could not transfer to another store because I could hurt the store. by the district Manager.
good,Enjoy working and interacting with many difference customers.Dollar General need offer health care to all employees
good,"• Earned management trust by serving as key holder, responsibly opening and closing store."
good,The company is what it is. Nothing really impressive. Their was some corruption in the managerial area. Customers were typically rude. The pay and workload didn’t match well.
good,Too much work for time allotted and lack of payroll and employees I did 62 days straight some open to close and split shifts at that time exhausting for normal day
good,I've met alot of people here it's a fun place to work sometimes.the company itself knows nothing about what is goin on in the stores they just want you to be there to get things done an you very seldom can talk to anyone if their is a problem
good,Sucked....it’sNot worth it ...just don’t! If you don’t have a high school diploma or GED it’s pretty good it’s a job you can do and even be manager in there’s no requirement Other than having a car to go to the bank however if you upset your manager your GM they can fire without question they can give you any sort of reasoning for firing you and it can be changed later without reason even if it’s a lie to their purpose of getting rid of you
good,"I start my workday by asking my shift manager what needs to be done. I listen/complete tasks given such as stocking shelves or dealing with our totes and items that needs to be put out. While doing this I am on register being a cashier whenever customers arrive. This mean I am constantly on foot dealing with customers, their questions, finding items, stocking shelves, and even answering phone calls. I also do the stocking of reshot items, which takes time and energy."
good,This was a ok poace to work if you habe a manager that is knowing what they are doing. They do put the same person as cashier and don't put other people for cashier.
good,"DG policy requires a minimum of 2 employees on each shift and usually that's all there is. It's impossible to do all the things that need to be done on your shift, especially when you're the only cashier on shift. Customers rightfully get upset but there's not much you can do to appease them when you're the only cashier."
good,"I personally didn’t enjoy working here, It was completes a cluster everytime I walked in, they just through me in expecting me to know where and what to do."
good,"management  is nice to work with,  hours are long ,meet some nice customers,learn management skills as you train learn different  store safety training."
good,High turn over in managers. Need to pay employee more money the work never stops need detail traing for people like me who wants to move up in position they teach you enough to open a store thats all the back stuff is wjat gets you behind need more hours to get stuff done its always a rush rush hurry hurry
good,"I was hired as a Turn-key manager. The store was short on manpower. I was the CSR. I am a highly energetic person. My manager would not let me do freight, etc. I felt like I was in a dead-ended job. I was terminated for checking myself out. I bought some kids in the neighborhood some snacks using my debit card. The manager was very unfair. Other managers who worked alone checked themselves out at the register, but I got terminated. Never again, will I ever work for this manager..."
good,Working for DG was an experience. The management would tell you to leave if you got a complement. The Breaks seemed to be so far apart and they expect so much from just one person.
good,"While at Dollar General i learned how to manage my time and work better with the public. "
good,Was a great working experience first time around. Second time store manager was unprofessional and had to walk out because of child care issues. There wasn't enough staff to cover absences. In which called corporate and reported misconduct of store manager. Store manager is no longer there.
good,"Need more hours to help with workload. Need two days off a week not one. Can’t get rest with one day off. "
good,"Dollar General is not a good place to work. They push you beyond your limits. It's all about the money, not the customer or employee. There is never enough employees working, customers wait in long lines all the time."
good,No room for advancement. No incentives offerec to management on a consistant basis. Upper management instability. Inadequate loss prevention plan and repercussions in place.
good,Most store managers are great. Some are a total you know what. If you work there a long period of time you can hang up advancement opportunities because the store manager offers it to the new people. Don't have a second job because the store manager will let you go.
good,"Management is hard on you even if you do all that they ask of you. Not good pay, no benefits. No room to move up. Was always in trouble for things I didn't do or have control over."
good,They were over all nice to your face just had allot of favoritism. Seemed like they never appreciated my work & never tried to help me. Seemed like a problem when I asked questions.
good,"Stressfull Cashiering and multitasking for 10-15 hours a week is not something professionals would rely on for income. 0 breaks and if any, they are expected to be 5-10 min short, while managers can sit around for hours on their phone."
good,"Lots of unfinished work always. Learned nothing really. Management was poor from all areas. Withing and above. Store was always disorganized, small, crowded, short handed, and over worked employees. Hard to work and not have time for family."
good,"work hard and fast to impress boss or hours get cut "
good,"I was promised full time within a month of start date and never got it, only got about 25 hours a week max. Full time people rarely got above 36 hours. The employees were great to work with but the job really isn't worth all the drama."
good,"Mngmnt feels its ok to invade your personal space if they choose, and yell shut up at staff if they wanted to. Mngmnt holds you inside the location off the clock for no reason."
good,"I easily adavnced inside the store I was in, but with that also means coming in every time someone calls in. Filling all empty positions, never enough hours given, never enough employees to work it, to much merchandise for the amount of people in a store to get it all on the shelf."
good,"The physical part of the job isn't that bad, if you run non-stop for 10-14 hours per day. Management is highly unorganized, rarely communicates with the employees, and barely even communicates with your direct supervisor."
good,The company is good and the management is good. But the Employer/employee relationship is selective. The stores are well kept but can be dangerous for the customers with the rolltaners and the stuff all over. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep hours when they are not being given fairly.
good,"I enjoy the customers and some of the people I work with. The work is fast paced no room for advancement, poor management. Very little work ethnic from other employees."
good,"Fast paced environment. Always something that needed to be done. I just felt like I was undervalued by my employer constantly. You are able to work at different dollar general locations and get paid mileage as well, which is good."
good,"The company has done nothing for me as far as career advancement. Every time there was an opening for a store manager, they'd hire someone who lives in a different district or someone who constantly quit and return. I've helped multiple stores and majority of the store managers, employees, and assistant managers have all asked me why I don't have my own store buy now."
good,they need better managment cause alot of the mananger dont pay attention to what is going on in the store or with the employees nor do they help corretly when a employee needs help.
good,"If an employee wanted to advance within the company, it was based on Store Manager's preference rather than employee merit or capabilities.  Although it  says it is says it is an equal opportunity, not based on race, gender or religious affiliations, the company does not accommodate nor respects your beliefs and hired mainly one gender in store."
good,The job was not hard and having to deal with people was okay but the employees and management caused way to much unneeded stress in the workplace to the point that work cause more stress every week then my college classes did.
good,I loved working there in the beginning but it does begin to be repetitive and stressful when other employees call off or decide to quit with no notice. But I have dealt with almost every excuse there is to not come into work. Now it's hard since I have 2 kids and can't just leave for work because they don't provide babysitters for all shifts and you cannot depend on other people to actually show up to work.
good,Dollar General is very unorganized. I was not trained well in several aspects of the job. My coworkers did not receive any training either. My manager tried to make us reach unrealistic goals and became furious when we did not meet them. The job itself is not terrible; its the management.  I also was not interviewed.
good,It was sloppy and I did like working for my first manager but not the second one. The first manager at the first store was hard working just as his employees but the second wasnt
good,"I started working for DG in October. My managers at the time promoted me to key holder. Which meant I have register keys to void items and I could open and close the store. However a week after she promoted me, she walked out. District threw in a bunch of random managers in who were not only rude but started working employees from their own stores instead of ours. Our employees were only getting one or two days a week because of it. Then my title as key holder was ripped from me because they said I wasn’t ready... I didn’t even have the chance to be fully trained yet but they stripped me of my title and my pay that I was given anyways and then two weeks later gave it to the new girl who didn’t know the register at all and didn’t know the store. I had to train her on how to run a register and do things that I had already learned."
good,Everyone geeked up on energy drinks and chewing tobacco was hired under false pretenses interviewed for equipment operator had certification and all but they put me on case pack I gave them a couple of months to fix they never did so I quit..don't care bout employees because you are working 6 days a week 12 hr shifts I wouldn't recomend long break but as soon as u stop moving its hard on feet to get back going
good,My district manager made everyone’s work life very miserable and did not appreciate your hard work as she felt we wasn’t exactly “customer ready “ for over 3 years.
good,If they consintrated more on their employees and not how much money they are making they would actually keep employees. And they need to praise the hard working employs and get rid of the bad ones. They are bad about not caring for their employees. If they would change that maybe I would come back. Family is more important and it's hard for a single mother.
good,"Not recommended for permanent career goal. Dollar General pays horrible wages and puts everyone on minimum part time hours to avoid giving benefits. They're fine as a stepping stone, I guess, but I don't recommend getting stuck there."
good,i enjoyed working at dollar general we had a nice work group there now no one i worked with is there anymore except 1 woman. over the years i had good and bad management mostly good 1s. ive gotten to know more people and gotten out of my shyness alot working there.
good,"I think there should always be at least 2 people in the store at all times for safety issues, you never know what might happen when your left alone TY"
good,Unfortunately it’s an okay stepping stone but find a way out as soon as you get a better job. But that also depends on the management and the manager or supervisors. Not a good place to stay long term.
good,this was a decent place to work above district manager level did not recognize the need for home life balance. There was a complete lack of cultural awareness costing employees and resources.
good,"I worked here for a little over a year at two different locations. The one I had issues with was in Broadway, NC. I worked my way up from a sales associate to management all for a $0.25 raise from the minimum wage of $7.25. I was doing the job of a manager and an associate everyday which was a lot especially for $7.50 an hour. Employees with my same title were STARTED out with more per hour at other locations. Also, when I was working here they did not offer benefits and our lunch breaks were always cut short. At the time, I was a college student so it was just extra money for me but I could not imagine this being for anyone trying to make a living. The main reason I left was due to the manager giving the most hours to their favorite employees and giving the ones they didn't like as low as 3 hours all week. They would push these people to quit. I could not deal with all of the unnecessary drama and lying any longer. The do not rehire I was given after departing was worth it."
good,"great store manager bad assistant store manager. very quick wants you under 4.00 sec per item"
good,"Horrible you never know if you're going to get 20 hours 30 hours 40 hours a week you don't get paid anything at all you get called in on your days off, people get mean towards you if you say no to coming in on your day off regardless of your reasoning"
good,Management could use more training. Workplace is flexible. The job is not a hard job just need more payroll hours.The manager has more days off then the employees.
good,The managers will give you no slack even if you are doing your best. They hate the fact they are wrong or out of line with any situation that comes in the store.
good,"Working at Dollar General was enjoyable as I am a people person. Day started with counting tills, making sure areas was clean. Hardest part about the job was getting out of the store without running into overtime, which seemed to be a problem for the company."
good,"The work you do here is very predictable.  The only variant is the amount of customers and the speed in which you have to perform your assigned tasks.  Generally speaking the tasks you are required to do will not change.  It, in my experience, was a comfortable work environment."
good,Overall working at dollar general was very easy. Other then management not doing all the great the job itself was a very good job. It kept me busy and gave me a chance to work independently.
good,"While I believe in the core values of the company, the management was lackluster in instilling and implementing them. I wished to learn and enhance my skills and was discouraged and disciplined when I inquired."
good,"job was very stress-full work, i would get little hours only worked 3-4 days out of the week pay was bad had to do everything janitor stoker and cashier"
good,"It was a busy store. Most of the time Management employees worked alone. Not a very well managed store, high shrink and theft due to lack of coverage."
good,"Dollar General, as a company, is not a difficult company to work for.  The general manager for my particular store made it difficult for me to perform my duties as an assistant manager.  There was no structure or consistency.  Rules changed on a daily basis, and many of the store procedures were not followed."
good,"Its a rough neighborhood to work in. I was threatened out just about every day that i worked there, the police don have the time so half the time we re hung up on when we reach out. the other half but dont care to make it to the location. we are taught to be security guards without getting any extra pay for doing so. Management doesnt care much for the employees. we dont receive holiday pay unless you are a manager no matter how long you have worked there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers that actually care about the store and they tell me thanks for always keeping a smile on and making them feel like they were human every day. the worst part is the customers that try to take advantage of our always short handed staff and always burglarize and assault us at every turn"
good,It was nice when your new but I wouldn’t consider it a forever job because I was a part time before but I would get my hours this manager gives himself 49 hours and he doesn’t help
good,The store manager makes up their own rules and doesn't go by policy or procedures. The business is a great place to work for however the management at the store I worked at was very unprofessional.
good,You will be over worked and under paid. And if people want you out of there. They will quickly find  a way to get you fired.  They don't care about your protection in the workplace. They Just want the store to make money and merchandise put on shelves to sale.
good,"I would never work for this dollar general again, the boss is unfriendly and doesn't understand that you need time for your child doctors appointments or anything."
good,"I don't have anything good or bad to say, the job got me out of the house which was my main goal. I was bale to go in and do my assigned work and come home at the end of the day."
good,Once you become a manager you home life is over. Dollar General becomes you life. You have to be there constantly. The money is good but not worth losing family time.
good,Wasn't a hard job at all didn't like working nights every shift just because I had family at home but was a good job loved the customers close to home
good,"as far as working with the public and customer interaction DG is a very rewarding place to work, the company however, assumes your a thief when hired, ive seen it time and time again"
good,"lack of benefits an a very stressful an quick paced work environment. always excepted to go above an beyond without any of the recognition or pay. pay is too low for the job expected to do an management can be a hit or miss with the type of manager you get when going into the job. low hours to start an can be cut at anytime an can be ""adjusted"" according to how the manager feels toward a single employee. its not all bad though the customer service aspect can be very rewarding in seeing the regular customers an creating a bond with them an making a persons day just a bit better."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"Its stressful not alot of help, very low pay almost been ther 3 years and only get paid $7.75. no benefits , no store discounts. Always drama with the people u work with. The customers do always make it better, there so kind and respectful."
good,The store is left defenseless every night shift. Management makes more dangerous policies for the cashier at random. Customers are hostile to new employees if they are not from the area and are well liked.
good,Key holder left me in the store several times alone after dark. General manager used me to fire her and then gave me one 4 hour shift for the next week as if i was in the wrong.
good,"ok job I liked the work.Left because they cut my hoursThe work is not that hard if wveryone worked together.At the time I worked there,people just were not willing to do their job .and left most of the work for the night people to clean up It wasn't fair."
good,"Stressful. Not enough hours to maintain the store. always a mess. Customers are awful, you definitly do not get paid enough to with stand that abuse. Nothing gets fixed. "
good,"I enjoyed the customer interaction "
good,The store I worked at was a mess when I started. So it just got really bad fast. The store manager was on medical leave. But then she was unable to return to work. So the temp store manager was lied to about her job. The store just fell apart. I was the worst place I have ever worked.
good,It was very productive while the manager treatment was equal. Over night the manager started verbally insulting customer and employees. I had to walk out because she was insulting me and my personal life.
good,"I worked at two different locations. One was a very organize and pleasant place to work. Everyone came in on time and were always courteous. The second location  in Moonville,SC promoted me to Key Holder but continued to pay me a cashiers salary. When I asked them to about it no changes were made. I had to work others shifts because otherwise the store would have to close early. No one wanted to come to work so I was often left alone in a very busy store."
good,"This is a great place to start, but not a great place to stay. The management is a piece of work, the hours are lacking, everything is done through favoritism and it's really not worth trying to make a career out of it."
good,"This job was very stressful, only because it was understaffed. I would have to do the job of 7 people and only get paid for being a cashier. however a good part about the job was that I would get to see and talk to a lot of the same customers and they knew me by name"
good,"Being the only retail store in a small town, it is a pretty busy place, and you have to be on the ball, and be a fast learner. You need to be on the ball and pay attention to your surroundings. ."
good,Management got sick of people calling out so all current workers were forced to find coverage for thier shiftd. If you couldn't then you had to work or be fired
good,"I really enjoyed dollar General at first. Then I found out I wouldn't get paid higher than  7.50 till after a year. I was working very very hard for getting paid so little. Also the manager was a very negative person, even made comments about suicide. I'm a very positive person and that was not the right environment for me. They all really liked me and wanted me to stay but I did not want to have that environment around me."
good,"more of a hassle than a job. Bad pay, bad hours and questionable management. I managed to work at this job for over a year but it seemed like they try to make you want to quit."
good,"A good place for experience as a first job or second for retail. Location is clean, friendly staff and management. Customers can be overwhelming at times and the storage room may not always be organized."
good,When I first started working at Dollar General for me as cashier was very slow I was making under the minimum hours but eventually time progressed and I managed to get minimum hours to maximum hours after management switched up then I became unemployed.
good,"High turnover lead to an need to continuously train new employees and average management that was unable to keep up, lead to the majority of new employee training to be done by the lowest level workers."
good,"It was an okay job, doesn't have benefits or good hours. The store only has two cashiers at night. You don't have time to get things done because there aren't enough workers there."
good,"Alot of back a forth from the front of the store to the back.. Putting up stock near the back of store and running to the front to cash people out. registers are old and slow, The scan guns wouldn't work. You would close at 10:30 pm and have to open at 6am the next day. My customers was what I liked the most"
good,I've had 8 years of customer service experience and have never worked in an environment that could care less about providing great customer service than Dollar General.
good,"Working at the Dollar General was not hard, but most of the time it was very unorganized and if one person messed up the whole staff was punished for it."
good,"Only good for a in between job the store was in horrible condition and management was not good at all, and safety was not good at all we were constantly robbed a few times this was the dollar General in Brown deer which is no longer open"
good,"Its not the worse job! It's peaceful and easy! If you are still living at home with your parents and are working for spending money it's a great job! On the other hand, if you are a single parent raising children...its not the idea carreer!"
good,"Hardest part of the job would have been when i was talked down to all the time and when i wasn't appriciated for the work i did. And when I didn't know what to do i wuld get yelled at for not already knowing. Also they threw me on the register without any training,"
good,I worked in store development as a contractor which later changed to project execution.  I had the most scared micro manager boss of them all. She was so scared of her boss it showed ridiculously. She would show how to do the work and then she would do it for you. I worked there 7 months and I've never worked in an environment where people don't speak when they come in.
good,"You have to bend over backwards for customers who just want to run over you. You gain a lot of experience in different areas, but they do not give workers enough time to fulfill their tasks. They have unreasonable expectations as far as work productivity, and your life/family comes second in hand to their work."
good,"When i began to work here, i was never given an employement package. was working full time, but once they found out i was pregnant, they reduced my hours from 40 to 8 hours and eventually letting me go."
good,The pay was decent but the stress I was put threw was not worth it and the manager was rude and the workers I worked with where awful..they didn't know how to do there job at all
good,they do not respect there employees if u have kids they will not work with ur schedule I was hurt and they did not have any compassion. THERES NO RESPECT.
good,"If you are working with a good group of people then the job goes by smoothly. Sadly, if the GM doesn't like you then you probably wont get any hours. The pay is also horrible."
good,The staff at Dollar General were pleasant and fun to work with but the job was very strenuous and can take a toll on your physical body. I don't feel that they paid you in accordance to the amount of work that you were required to do.
good,"Very interesting. I can only speak on the location I worked at. It was definitely a place you work when you just want to work, not a place that you can plan to be forever and build a career out of."
good,Dollar general is not a reliable place because they promise you hours when you start of but really you will be only be working 1 day out of the day. They over work you in the small time that u do work. They also don't pay enough.
good,Pay is extremely low for the amount of work that is expected from you. I have 8 years of retail and management experience and was barely making more than minimum wage.
good,At the beginning it was a great job. But as time went on and things have changed a million times it became a difficult job. I did enjoy the work I did
good,I worked my position by stocking shelves. It was a decent job for a little while but it got redundant very quickly. There was no skill or knowledge involved. I would have rather been working for something I have passion for.
good,I enjoyed the customers and meeting new people on a day to day basis. I loves the work and always staying busy. I learned how to run a register how to open and close the store. I also learned how to check in the vendors and do the credits. I also supervised cashiers and trained them to work register and stock shelves.
good,This is the job if you like to deal with crazy people. I can same this was one of my least favorite jobs. Customers were very harassing but easily dealt with.
good,"My experience with Dollar General was fairly interesting. I worked there for a little over two years. In the mist of my working for this company, I was able to transfer to several different stores in different states. But my entire experience wasn't always positive. When I lived in Mississippi, I was able to work in a friendly environment. Whereas, when I moved to Arkansas, my experience was horrible. The store was not a safe environment, my coworkers were okay to work with, however one of the managers made it very difficult to be around. I had a life threatening experience during my last few days of working for Dollar General. "
good,You would help unload the truck when it came it. Then you would stock the shelves. All the same time while you were waiting on customers. Hardest part of the job was that you had at least three activities going on at the same time. But you were also meeting new people all the time.
good,The part I enjoyed the most would have to be just meeting new customers every day. I did not like how unorganized the management system was. There wasn't a lot of help on the sales floor.
good,"Will not hire any associates full-time, would only give employees up to 33 hours. Both male and female employees shared the same restroom as the restroom that was reserved for women was full of overstock and other items"
good,"A lot on worch for minimum wage and when you get a promotion is not even a 25 cent raise, not enough hour.but friendly coworkers.the supervisor would choose favorite."
good,"Wasn't there long because I had gotten let go after my week of being there but it's alright. Didn't really like it , there was no communication , bad job an  there was no professionalism"
good,"Terrible job. You have to do everything by yourself. It's hectic, unprofessional and dirty. They expect you to be able to magically know when a customer needs to rang up while they have you fixing shelves in the back with no other employees in the store. The guest get furious. Bad set up"
good,"At the location I work for we do have a good work environment between all of us as co workers. The issue is with management they give you 48 hours since the moment you receive your truck that has your stock on it to put it all away. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal but when you have one of the smaller stores and you recieve 1200 pieces on the truck that is a lot to put away in that short amount of time. Also as a cashier you have totes to do on a daily basis, you need to get 4 totes done an hour on top of cashing out customers, helping customers, and getting carts. They also send key holders to other stores to help and they don't ask you they just assume you will go. They over work you to the point of havingno social life or you close then open the next day all week. High turn over is encouraged so they dont have to give raises or benifits. Also a lot of theft in the company from the stores to beyond. Its a decent place as long as you don't move up to any type of management areas."
good,It was a good first job for about two months but then the realization set that the pay was horrible and there were literally no benefits. No discounts or anything else that would be expected from other companies such as amazon or Walmart.
good,"Overall, I am unhappy with dollar general. I loved the part of my job that allowed me to interact with people, but I wasn't happy with the fact that they don't care for their employees. After working for the company for two year, they cut all their part-time employees hours, deny any chance of forward advancement, and cut off all health plans. It was impossible for me to continue working with only eight hours a week. It wasn't even enough money to pay for my gas to get to work. I was a loyal employee until the end though. I managed to serve rough 500 customers and still stock more than was required by me in a eight hour shift. I manged my drawer, did cigarette counts, and helped lock up at the end of the night."
good,I feel when you are doing multiple job titles you should be paid accordingly. They send them the money for the week an your hours are base on how much money they send
good,Work is not to hard. Great for a person who is just trying to get experience. work hour are flexible. You can definitely move up in the company but not enough money to support your family.
good,"I honestly don't have much to say about this company, i had a great team at first and ended up getting transferred without being told until it was too late. The manager was terrible and at the end they lost a great worker."
good,"Had the managers not both been pregnant, they may have worked a little harder. I liked the fact that I had the chance to interact with so many different people. The work was not hard at all but the store would sometimes get busy."
good,I would have stayed there if I had not been lied to and some co-workers with less experience than me earned more and got more hours. I was told I was full time and turned out to really be part time.I really enjoyed working there but the lack of communication and conflicts led to me quiting.
good,Customers were usually friendly.  Staff was lazy and had to constantly be monitored.  No healthcare and no benefits.  Working all holidays and weekends gets old.
good,There did not seem to be much structure within the company. There had been an abundance of turn-over in staffing. I had relocated to 3  stores in different parts of Texas and with each one I had to be Acting Manager while waiting for the Company to hire a manager to replace the ones that had quit.
good,"It was fun at first, but its getting old. Sometimes I just wait to clock out honestly. Also, we get out schedules at the last minute which makes it hard to plan my life."
good,I worked at two different dollar general stores. they both had an equal amount of people come in. The employees were great and they both had good management. What I enjoyed the most is when I got to help the customers. I loved the different conversations that they would bring in. With the customers that would come in almost every day it was great to be able to carry on the conversations that we left off on. The hardest part was having to ask my co-worker to constantly come to the counter because I wasn't a key-holder. It was more inconvenient than anything. Overall it was a great experience for me.
good,"On a typical day you'd have to call in an hour before scheduled time of work to make sure the work schedule has not changed, prepare for work, clock in, and do the normal duties of the job. I learned that you have to be prepared to work even on your off days and the schedule can change at any point in time so make a point to check in. Management there was very unprofessional. They mixed their personal life in with the job. As my first job I looked for the manager to inform me of any changes in time of work or to at least train me. I'm grateful to be a quick learner and taught myself to work. My co-workers didn't help me much. Nothing about the job was really hard. Through the whole experience I did enjoy working in a place where I deal with people. The customers were the highlight of the job."
good,It was a good place to work until management changed hands. Working full-time hours for part-time pay and no benefits.
good,A typical day way me either being on register checking out customers or me stocking all the selves of merchandise. I also would unload tots that had merchandise for the front end. I learned everyday to be patient with people and help them out as much as possible. My co workers were good. I cant really say there was a absolute hard part about my job because I found it all very easy to handle. The most enjoyable part about my job was being able to meet new people and helping them find what ever it was they needed and for them to leave happy.
good,"Not much to say, this too was a slow paced work environment, and not much room to grow."
good,Great workplace just awful pay. They also refuse to give you overtime.
good,The experience working at Dollar General was some what enjoyable. The job and workplace is nice. The only problem I encountered was the managers were rude. If the store had better management i wouldn't have a complaint about the store.
good,"The tasks of working in a dollar store are not very difficult. There is a high demand of labor required but not excruciating. In management and with the will to see ones workplace excel, it is a good environment to see a career in. Work isn't difficult but requires effort. Basic duties are of any manager, the higher the position the more paperwork."
good,"i enjoyed being a cashier and working for dollar general, but there were no benefits and the location of store made it not such a good place for employment."
good,"I actually enjoyed this job a lot. About a month after i got the job I found out I was pregnant. It was fine for awhile because when I got the job, my store manager agreed that I did not have to work on Sundays at all or Wednesday evenings because I was in church at that time. I enjoyed this as it helped me balance work and church and it seemed as a fair agreement, especially since I was part time working just under 40 hours each week. As my pregnancy progress, my store manager became rude and went back on our deal, he would schedule me every Sunday and most Wednesday evenings. I was told I still had to push a line of carts and mop the entire store at 7 months pregnant, which really hurt my back and stomach. I would also need a break occasionally because I had anemia and low blood sugar and would often feel like I was going to blackout/pass out, which in one occasion I almost did, and I would often get in trouble for sitting for a few seconds and drinking a cold bottle of water to ensure i was okay. I quit the job when I entered my 8th month of pregnancy as the physical and mental stress from my manager was too much. Even the other managers thought he was being ridiculous. Other than my manager, I absolutely loved the job and the company."
good,Dollar General is a company with potential but does not give much thought to the employees. It was hard to get rest or a break form duties well over worked and under paid. never praised and the rewards always went to the big bosses not the employees who actually did the work. I enjoyed working at Dollar  General because i enjoyed the customers and helping them find what they needed and solving problems.
good,"My typical day would start out at around 3pm I would come in and relieve the cashier from the previous shift, log in and start my shift. My work consisted of clocking in then checking the shelves to see if they needed stocked (as long as I had no customers to check out) then I would stock anything that needed stocked while in between checking out customers, at the end of my shift we would count out our money drawers, then I would complete my assigned cleaning tasks whether that be cleaning the bathrooms and the isles and/or the front part of the store."
good,Interacting with the customers and trying to resolve their needs for shopping at dollar general in a timely manner.
good,"lack of training to employees. The rules change everyday, one day you do it and you'll get fired, and the next day if you don't do it you'll get fired. Feeling of walking on egg shells on a consistent basis.Very high turnover, all the way from a store employee to a Regional Manager. Lack of Management of any kind."
good,"learned to run cash register,met a lot of nice people,learne to stock shelves"
good,Co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job. They always tried to make the work day better.
good,"Fun, worked in housewares. Enjoyed meeting different people"
good,I learned that you have to put your best effort and management wasn't ready for the role i loved my co-workers it wasn't hard work i love putting out freight .
good,The store manager was very sexist and refused to alow a male to advance.
good,"The enjoyable part of the day was working with the public, my customers."
good,"This company does not promote well, and the management team is very unprepared and incompetant. Not a good company to work for."
good,Gained a ton of experience in the retail industry and learned some valuable management skills while working there. I really enjoyed the interaction with different customers and helping them find the items they were looking for. The hardest part was unloading the trucks.
good,n/a its not really a good company to work for alot of the managers are being investigated. 
good,We were paid poorly and the management based schedule hours depending on how they felt about you. 
good,"I typically come in at 3 or 4 operate the cash register, make the shelves look nice, stock stuff, and clean stuff. I learned that I have a strong work ethic and can multitask. The management was awful, and played major favorites. The coworkers were lazy, slow, and inept. The job was not hard.I enjoyed trying to scan items faster than other sales associates. "
good,"In the beginning it was a great place to work, I woke up wanting to go to work, but toward the end my hours had started to get cut, and I was not granted requested time off. I would always go to work, and do my job to the best of my abilities. This included running freight, working the register, and handling the deposits as well as the change fund."
good,A typical day at work varies day to day. The hardest part of my job was struggling to keep the back room clean and organized only to have it ruined by other employees or truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and easiest was the cash handling.
good,"a typical day on the job was very busy, the best part of the job would of been the regular customers. they were always a joy to see and share mall talk with. the hardest part would have been unloading the truck by hand with at times over 2000 packages."
good,I worked part- time and I learned different things that I didn't kknow before and the management was ok and the coworkers were ok.There was nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable part of it was I had a job.
good,"Dollar General was am up beat company but the managers were selfish to some employees but still had their favorites. I enjoyed working the cash register and dealing with the customers, but overall it was the ideal job for the younger generation."
good,"A typicle day at work for me was really always the same. Come in, get my register started, and then stock shelves and clean the store."
good,"if looking for a job and need one quick... as long as you have open availability this is the place. stocking, recovering, cashiering, & customer service. pay isn't the best but it's something."
good,There was a lot of work to do and not enough pay.  Management at the beginning was horrible and they cut me back to four hours a week. Thankfully the got new management. But it just didn't pay enough for me.
good,I don't feel good there anymore since I had a gun pointed at me and still absolutely not one person from corporate office even checked on me at all.. my manager hasn't even said a word to me about it but told others he's glad I'm ok.
good,They expect more than they are willing to pay your for................................................. if the upper management isnt good the work experience will be unpleasant.
good,No time to do anything very hard job only needs to be for high energy teenagers. Management was poor. There were no downtimes for the hours you had to work.
good,"Always understaffed, severe micromanaged, low payroll but high expectations. Upper management would make visits and destroy the morale of the entire unit. Upper management needs to work in a unit to understand how things really work and get a grasp on reality. They always cut payroll to the point of compromising customer service. But the top management still make millions in bonus. There are units out there with one employee in the building for several hours at a time making it a safety issue for that employee."
good,The company does not have the correct focus they should focus on the employees and customers and have it where all managers or mods know what is needed to be done in and outside of the store.
good,"Loved the job and customers ut co-workers were petty and childish; seems they weren't happy unless they were talking behind other co-worker's backs or creating drama. Was very upset that, after 2 years working for them, I was informed that only 'keyholders' were eligible for pay raises; many time I worked my days off or came in early, and never considered for a raise or even received a thank you!"
good,"Nothing ever was organized. Trucks needed to be worked but no one would do them, lack of scheduling people correctly. Managers were never at work. Store always looks a mess."
good,"They did not pay me correctly for hours I had worked. They did not compensate for college exams. They were rude and petty if you corrected them, even if you did it nicely."
good,"Just not a good place to work, unless you're looking for something temporary. I've had maybe 2 good managers out of the time of working there, but management is very poor in those stores"
good,"No overtime offered or benefits, different schedule weekly, hours fluctuate, demanding work is fine but too many workers that are subpar and its tolerated."
good,"I was responsible for stocking shelves, running a cash register, helping customers. There was two things that would bother me about this position. When I needed more hours and they were not able to accommodate I started trying to work with another company along with them and they dropped my hours from about 20 hours to 4 hours a week. Also, if the power would go out we were expected to stay in the building and stocking shelves."
good,I still work there till this day. Been there for about 2 or 3 months. Iam always busting my back working while others watch me work and they do nothing but sit there and do little things.
good,"Constantly shorthanded, underpaid, no overtime, minimal benefits. Majority of the time, if in a keyholder position, you are by yourself and expected to work truck and provide customer service to everyone during busy hours."
good,The stores are understaffed. Ive had to work long hours. Some employees get away with just about everything possible like using their phones and not wearing proper attire.
good,I loved it here till they started not giving me enough hours to actually be able to take care of myself. It’s like they thought I was a teen living at home with my parents. It wasn’t any fair opportunity for extra hours
good,"I loved working there the first 6 months, but ultimately unprofessional management was the reason for my leaving. Other than that however,  working at Dollar General was a decent experience. I loved most of my team and my customers. The job itself was routine and easy enough. Certain days were much faster paced than others, which can be really annoying on truck days."
good,"greet customers, check out customers, restock shelves and clean sales floor. Answer phone calls and provide information on an existing product, conduct ourselves in a professional but friendly manner and offer any assistance needed."
good,if you was good worker they made you work constantly while trying to please everybody else she was not being fair no matter how many times you would address it
good,"Love the company and the reason it is there for.  Do not care for some of the people in the place that feel that they own you and can belittle you because of a disability.  It is not right that they get to keep their jobs and other lose theirs because of it."
good,"I had to keep following up on my application process. They are very slow at processing background checks. The store management recruited me and were very anxious to get me started and trained; however, they also ran into snags at corporate level. It was very frustrating, but I hung in there and got hired. I enjoy working there. I like my co-workers and the customers."
good,I would not recommend this company as the policies and management does not uphold to what you are taught. There isn't any security felt here and for the job it's highly underpaid.
good,Only thing I like me about working here was my coworkers. You only get a $.25 raise yearly. It does not help to further career opportunities and I worked a little over 2 years before I left there. I wouldn’t go back if I didn’t have to but it’s a job.
good,It’s best to work there if you have no family life. They are not truthful about what the hours are and if you will be hired in or not. But you will always get more then 40 hours a week
good,The easiest thing was working because all we had to do was unload boxes and stock all day. The hardest was dealing with management because they never cooperated with you
good,"At first Dollar general was a nice place to work for, but the longer I stayed the more and more things just wasn't adding up. I was training to be a key holder and had to take on more responsibility than a normal cashier. The more I opened myself up to this new role, the poorer our management got. I would ask questions and hardly ever got an answer. The hardest part was trying to learn the company by myself, us employees had a good working relationship. And the most enjoyable part was getting to know the reular customers and my cashiers. I learned a lot about the company and the people."
good,Working at Dollar General there is alot of turnover due to inconsistent hours unless you are management. Hours are never steady and no one has a set schedule.
good,"When I first got hired, the manger, literally threw me under a bus, the ones that actually taught me what I really know, were the rest of the employees that worked there. Honestly, it is a horrible experience, they do truly make you work so much for so little pay. There are only two people at the store at all times, which takes 4 people to do work, they only want two. "
good,It was a good job I just didn’t get many hours a week and they really was not paying much for for me to live off with my one year old son . But other then that if they was paying more or was given more hours they I would tell other people about it .
good,"My manager was the main issue at this job, she was a very sour woman. She often would volunteer me for crazy hours at other locations and I had little to no say in the situation. For a month I was transferred to a location that was closing, which actually was the most enjoyable part of my tenure there. I quite liked my job when I was at the second location, but once it closed and I went back to my home store I ended up quitting within a week because the general manager was so terrible."
good,"This is not a job for the weak. They will typically have 2-3 people working the entire shift. Along with working the cash register you are required to put up inventory and have to be back at the register whenever there is a customer. It is almost impossible. A lot of running back and forth. It takes a while to move up and if you mess up at all you must call the manager or key holder working at the moment and they come over and fix the issue, you cannot do it as a cashier yourself. The whole job is stressful. You also are required to know sales that are current and if something rings up a different price you have to get the manager to override the price because you cant."
good,I wouldn't work with dollar general again. the hours weren't that great. the people weren't that great. I couldn't get any benefits because of the little hours I got.
good,I loved the job and the people in the community even my coworkers just the management wasn't fair. If you work hard you should be rewarded not lied too.
good,Folcroft Dollar General was good with the first crew. The new crew isn't. Corporate needs to train it's managers about job edicate when transferred to another facility. Introduce yourself to the staff. No run the store as a party
good,"I never felt safe at work because the manager would always go on break, right after I would get there and she would leave the building and she wasn't supposed too. Then once when I was on break I was in the back by the breakroom table and an old guy came up to me and started talking weird and he was making me very uncomfortable. So, that was one really good reason why I left Dollar general. "
good,I always have to work my job and others jobs and not getting nothing but a quarter raise is not showing appreciation for what workers are doing they have managers lazy because they dot want to work
good,People were rude to you everyday and all day. The manager didn't care if you had been up for 18 hours. It was 'come in or your fired'. There weren't enough people to run the store.
good,They want you to just keep your head down and not say anything about your supervisors. Very fast paced job no work life balance and great pay and benefits
good,"clock in "
good,Management was not good. No benefits. No overtime. Not enough hours. No time for bathroom breaks. Not enough people to help. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people.
good,"manager and supervisor direction was very poor. when you had a problem it was just over looked. as long as the store was open, that is all that mattered."
good,The company is growing very quickly and there is lots of opportunities for advancement. The company is remodeling and adding new stores every year. I do believe the company could remodel more stores and react quicker to maintenance issues.
good,"Lots of altercations with customers. Only one break period. Pay was okay, but with all the stuff you had to do, I feel like the pay could've been at least $8"
good,"The manager and staff treated new staff like idiots, downgrading them rather than setting them up to succeed. It was almost as if they weren't expecting to keep the staff that they just hired."
good,Was amazed by the managements lack of attention to provide proper information regarding alleged accusation to have been proven false but termination could not have been overturned.
good,Terrible management and too high of expectations. Unfair scheduling and constantly undermining low status employees. Long busy hours. Must remain busy at all times.
good,I enjoyed working at the location I was at because I got to work with great team members and love seeing new faces daily.  Downside was there was no sympathy with the concerns of the employees.
good,Spent long hours on my feet. Restocked everything and set new displays. Hardest part of the job was working with management to get hours and overall the experience was not bad.
good,"Depending on the store manager your job can be easy or frustrating. They expect so much with no hours and low pay. No time for your personal life. There's never a set schedule, its always ""subject to change"". Customers have too much authority if they call corporate."
good,"Within my year of working at the Dollar General, I met many great people along the way. Focusing mostly on the business itself, it was ran carelessly. The manager was not up to par, she didn’t address obvious harassment and bullying in the work place, she would change employees schedules without notice and reprimand staff for missing a shift because of lack of notice in change. I was only part time but I worked full time hours without full time pay and benefits. Management wouldn’t consider other ideas or suggestions but would  belittle staff and downplay their concerns. The job overall possibly could’ve been better and more pleasant if it were ran by someone who cares for the job entirely."
good,"management sucked they couldn't keep there help due to over working them, didn't offer any benefits, store was trashed and manager didst know how to do her job"
good,"female managers are often paid less than males"
good,"This job is very fast paced, some hard like throwing freight. Good customer relation skills are a must. It's rewarding when your customer compliments you."
good,Company is great to work for to meet new people. Needs more stability but is a good job to have for side money.If you are looking for a job to grow in this is not the proper job.
good,I am a hard worker who does my tasks in a timely manner when I am scheduled to come into work.I am people oriented I enjoy the interaction on the daily basis in which makes twenty four hours of the day go by much faster.
good,store Managers were required to work 6 days a week amd close at least 2 nights. we had to work atleast 50 hours a week. we didnt get enough hours for the amount of work that needed to be done so i was in there 10 to 12 hours 6 days a week
good,When i first started working with Dollar General it was.great and i enjoyed working for them in Tennessee but after transferring to Florida the higher management has no.respect for individuals that keep the store open and running for customers to shop..i will not put anyone in that position or recommend no one to work at Dollaer General
good,Not a fun place to work management is poor. They didn’t allow me to health benefits at all stocking was okay it was a lot for the low pay. My crew members was okay they would help me out more than managers.
good,"The manager dumped everything she had to do on me then wrote me up for not getting her stuff and my stuff done, she would set me up to fail and try to give her a reason to fire me. Corporate asks to much from the employees and pay them to little."
good,"I was very organized and very well with customer service, cleanliness and honest . Very cooperative with coworkers and manager . Always positive when negativity came to the store ."
good,When I first started at this store I fully planned on moving up to management. Because of new management I decided to stick it out for a bit and see how it goes. I was working almost a full week and by the time I quit here I was down to barely two shifts a week. I enjoyed my job but unfortunately a bad boss will ruin any store. Save the frustration and work at a different location.
good,Wasn’t an awful place to work but wasn’t the best. Wanted more hours while we were short staffed got refused. Worked to hard got payed to less. Worked my heart out just to be able to afford gas with my check. Friendly customers but manager was not easy to work with always on her phone & always with an attitude.
good,"The managers were inconsistent in their responsibilities every store was unorganized and always short handed. Trucks came in with inventory and that stacked up in the storage room,and all employees were always rushing to put away stock from prior weeks.  Being short staffed the cashiers were continuesly busy checking out but expected a certain amount of inventory stock during their shift. This job was very stressful and unorganized in all aspects."
good,"you are always moving around "
good,"Some of the stores are great to work at, nice environment, friendly customers, easy-going shifts, etc. but some areas where there are store locations are very shady, run-down, and even outright dangerous environments to work in, and most of those stores only provide lousy security systems to vocally check in with the employees currently in the store, which does nothing to prevent theft or robbery. Pay is average, depending on the position (full/part time), and management, like the location, is a gamble. on one hand you could have great management, excellent shift coordination, plenty of hours, and effective team-work. but on the other hand, you could also end up with terrible store cleanliness, ignorant or apathetic store managers, and bad or overwhelming work hours, all with no chance of a raise or promotion (unless a lot of people quit, which is both very common and not what you'd expect in terms of shift quality). If i could do things differently, i would have scouted the locations around me, as you can apply at select locations instead of having your name picked from a list of ever-expanding applicants among a broad spectrum of locations, but instead of a manager simply picking a name from such a list, they get applications directly from those who apply to their respective locations. if the store ""feels"" like a match for you, go for it. chances are it will turn out to be a pretty good place to work, with good management, both store and district. otherwise, maybe look at some of their competitors, like Family Dollar, if it is more convenient,  although it might be the same"
good,"My review is,fast pace working not enough associates. Plenty of things to do and stay busy. Hardest part for me was being the only cashier. The best part about working their is small store easier to move around and get things done"
good,People that were scheduled were never at work when they were supposed to be. The Managment didn't take their job seriously and the hours were all over the place.
good,did the job because that was what I could get at the time.management not very good to blacks. you work while younger white people walk around and hide.
good,always taking care of customer have lots of product to put away. Night shift is a little  more tough because of the volume of customers sometimes and the amount of work to do.
good,Dollar general was very fast paced with a lot of friendly co workers. During certain times of the day we would hit a large amount of customers and it sometimes felt like we were understaffed. Everyone seemed to work together to make it an enjoyable time for our customers.
good,No security no real management everyone had horrible attitudes everyone was lazy and rude no one even cared to clean the store the new management is a pushover.
good,Not too bad of a place. I get regural customers that I loved to see on a daily. U get to really know some of the customers. Truck days r not fun at all their is a lot to get done on that day. Plus u have your normal duties that have to be done. And if your really busy with customers it's hard to get all that done before u leave
good,Dollar general doesn't care about you or anything outside. You are hired in at part-time no matter what position you applied for and can't get vacation or and kind of medical insurance unless full time. The employees lose the will to work fast and the ones that have been there for years are the most dead looking employees. Dollar General only cares about money and store rating if they could get by with paying less or using robots they would. Barely passes but sort of ok temporary job till you find something better.
good,The Job is easy but the management really sucks u can't ask a question for a customer with out them getting mad or calling u an idiot.  Restocking shelves are easy and finding things on the self isn't hard the clean up duties at the end of the night aren't hard
good,"The customer service manager was rude, and didn't care to help always talked down and was rude to customers."
good,If your willing to work hard and show that you really want it then they'll  work with you on hours and give you more days  to work if you need it .always work hard.
good,It was a very hard job to work at.. you had to work with some tough customers and management was no where around. We always completed against other store so it was not like dollar general was a family place to work. We were not 1 as a whole.should of had alot.of support but wasn't there.
good,Always short handed pay was docked without notice. No communication with upper management. They expect people to over work themselves for little pay definetly a place for high school/college students.
good,"I enjoyed fulfilling my services; however, scheduling, manager and other issues were a common occurrence. The duties were standard and not hard, it keeps you busy. They pay was minimum and no incentives. More incentives could assist when employees have to travel to help other locations that are not close to where they live."
good,"I was a part-time cashier for 3 months at the DG. You are expected to run the register, stock merchandise, put out roll containers and crates, and clean the whole store in a 4.5 hour shift. The workload does not match the pay. You can't do the work of two people and give the customers great service. You're constantly running back and forth from the isles to the registers to the stock room. The DG really needs night time stockers to get the merchandise out on the shelves. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and getting to know the regulars. I was working for a training store and our hours were very sporadic. Some weeks 10 hours, 8 hours, or not even on the schedule for the week. They pay you 8.00 an hour and expect you to be ""on call"" and available anytime. You also must be willing to travel 30 miles or more to get any real ""work"" hours each week. DG managers: quit hiring so many people and taking the hours away from the other hardworking employees."
good,I enjoyed working with the company. I was able to gain a lot of experience working for the company. The company always has job opportunities available. It does have a really high turnover.
good,Dollar general expect way too much for the workers in such little time and doesn't pay very well for everything that they want done other than that is not a bad job is quick to learn it is weekly pay
good,"I did not enjoy working at Dollar General for the following reasons, the hours were inconsistent which made it difficult on my schedule. The pay was not enough to cover my living expenses."
good,"I was an OK job. But they have a lot of work to do within the employment staff. They were unfairly, disrespectful, rude, inconsistent with everything. The store was never up to standards. And if you are good at the register, they will leave you without help."
good,"The mgr.played favorites, I couldn't get more than 20 hours a week no matter how available I made myself.mgr.and assistant manager worked same shifts leaving other shifts un-supervised,Jobs were not completed in timely manner and work areas and projects were never cleaned or replaced to stock area,leaving store cluttered and unmanageable,stock rotation was not implemented as should be"
good,"They put to much on you. While the managers where just on the office in their phones, or outside smoking. Like I said, you are expected to be at the register at all times and stock products that it's like 20 totes on a 4hr  shift."
good,I was looking for more than just a job.  It was only part-time with limited weekly hours.  Pay wasn't great and barely able to take breaks. Co-workers continuously either no show or called in.
good,"I did not have very good experience with manager or assist manager when you are the third key person, if some money come up missing when they are around and no money come up missing when they are not around and you get the blame for their mistake. I have worked for almost three month without management, and no money came up missing, but after we management hired, about 2 to 3 month later money starting to come up missing, and then more money. and yes I got the blame for it to come up missing, but I had no Idea that the place was being watched and they find out who was taking money. all and all people who work for dollar general have better witch them self."
good,I received great customer service reviews working there unfortunatly they never made it to corporate because of the management team there. I exited dollar general Corp. Because of the theft I discovered was going on there from the employees and I reported it. The hardest part of the job was a lot of miscommunication and the most enjoyable being greeting and serving the customers.
good,They were slow workers regardless of position and weren’t very enthusiastic when helping customers. However they were very considerate when showing me procedures and policies. Even with a couple mistakes.
good,"Usually they were always short handed, so I got lots of hours but then they just stopped scheduling me for a couple of weeks, so I was forced to go find other work. I enjoyed doing the remodels on the stores which is what I had to do to get 40 hours a wee"
good,"There is no real work life balance and the expectations are so extreme that it is hard to keep good help."
good,"Typical work day starts at 7:00AM, store operation hours are usually from 8-10, Manager usually does safety walk around store before opening, verifying tills and change fund"
good,I loved the overall job and customers. This is the type of job that allows you to gain experience in the retail . The down side of things are (like other jobs) the people and the atmosphere that you are working in. Part time employees don't receive any benefits and part time is what most people start out in through this company. They expect way to much for humans to get done in a limited time allotment. This eventuality makes it a stressful environment. Its a good temporary job to start getting back on your feet.
good,Its an descent place to work if you are just looking for work on the side. The hours are good from time to time. You only get benefits if you're full time.
good,Working to assist customers as much as possible to help locate the products they came to buy. Always staying busy by replenishing store shelves with product and ALWAYS RECOVERING!
good,"Wasn't great with hours and terrible scheduling. Management was cut throat when corporate visited. However, when it was a regular day, they'd sit in the break room on their phones all day."
good,manager was a nasty lady. she would make you do her job and yours in order to keep your own. i stayed just until i found another job  had to go. very stressful.
good,"Terrible working conditions "
good,"High volume and understaffed. Store and assistant managers were unorganized, nosy, gossips who ran off everyone worth something. The store manager would pry herself in employees lives and intervene when she didn't like what an employee was doing in their personal time. There was never enough employees in the store during our busiest hours and the store was unorganized beyond comprehension. The managers were lazy and complained about each other. The only managers worth anything either left or were run off by other employees."
good,Depends on management and how well they like you. Some stores are filled with drama. It does not matter if you are hard working and loyal and dependable. If one of them do not like you it spreads through the management and no one likes you.
good,The manager could not handle a schedule and was constantly changing it throughout the week without notifying employees and was quick to anger. He was no more qualified for managing than a teenager with no experience.
good,More opportunity for advancement would be great. Did not like working on Sunday. never knew exact time off. the best part of this job was pay day. no horseplaying
good,At first this job was good. As time went on I started not to see any growth in myself or in any management. I didnt have no support at all with the supervisor that I had. I took the blame for everything. Overall the most enjoyable part was the customers. I got a bond with alot of customers. I will miss them.
good,I feel I was terminated because of being a high paid Mgr. I was with them for 14 years of hard work also traveling to help others. I just wanted people to love their job too.
good,Gateway when I first started. Upper management is horrible! Charleston SC is the WORST market due to upper management. Great company if you have a great manager
good,working at dollar general out of high school into my young adult life as a company they except for you to not have a life outside of the business. i started online college courses along with starting a family and was told i need to quit or step down because i was not available at anytime 7 days a week from open to close.
good,The interview was almost non existent. Was very quick and laid back..not one question was asked of my past jobs etc.but I think its because she could tell I knew about the business.pay sucks...just $7.75 but I think I'll move up rather quickly due to the fact that they're down to only one key holder .I hope it works out good.weekly pay is always a plus.
good,"It is boring all day, I barely get training from the boss instead someone else has to train me which is a waste of production time. No benefits at all and got low payment."
good,"This is more of a job for someone that is in school, needs a second job, or just wants part time work. Its nice to have a check every week. I left this job because I was held at gun point twice in less than a week."
good,"DG does not show any appreciation to their employees and the pay is extremely low for a number of work task employees have to complete. DG has the potential to be greater than any mega store. However, there are a lot of things that can be changed, starting at the top. Also, very poor management."
good,"I'm glad for the opportunity at working for Dollar General, but sadly, their policy of only scheduling about 12 hours a week made it impossible to stay.  They would do better hiring more full time team members and offering benefits to them, then hiring part time people and expecting them to stay."
good,"Management at this location is not good. Manager was not a good working manager, she would belittle her employees in front of customers and call them names."
good,"This is an okay job , i had this job for almost a year until i told them i was needing some surgery, once i told them this , they completely quit giving me any hours ."
good,Be careful of district manager he will side with customer instead of employee even if employee is in the right. Instead of looking at employees problem of not getting paid enough to survive customer is always right so it's not a good way to do business
good,"Terrible place to work. My store manager was an awesome manager. She never asked any one to do anything that she wouldn't do. However, management above her made working there torture! They screamed about productivity but did not allow enough labor hours required to run the store the way it should be. The district manager was a complete moron! She wanted more productivity, however, every directive she issued was counter productive. (i.e., filling outs with like or less priced items, then taking too long to stock truck. There was a lot of time wasted pulling items that were moved to fill outs, and then putting correct item in the correct place.)"
good,manager was horrible never knew what was going on and quit right after i was hired on store is quick paced and i was only able to work 8 hrs but was always scheduled for 10 hours
good,"Worked here from 2006-2010, the management was not that great. Left in 2007 to go to school came back to the job and it was under another manager & that is when it went down hill. I knew everything about the job but never got a promotion. the manager at that time was really mean & old. she put everybody who quit on the non rehire list which wasnt right."
good,"they managers treat the employees badly and don't care about them, but the customers that come in are great and most of the time when you stock you can't find what you are looking for."
good,"In general, I believe if better management and more people were hired the work load wouldn't be so stressful. More trustworthy people being managers as well since we had an issue with a fellow manager stealing money."
good,until it gets back to corporate those managers do what they want not all of them are bad but most don't follow rules. But they need to put people with the right intentions in as managers and people who want to work as managers the ones who want to work get passed over for those who dont.
good,"I enjoyed the experience I received from the dollar store, but management was not good. My typical day was me doing the manager job while I still got paid, cashier wages."
good,You will only work overtime if they are  short staffed. If they are fully staffed you will not get all of your hours and won't be able to afford the health insurance. To get a 100% production rate you are literally running around. And if you don't make rate. You will be fired after 6weeks.
good,"I feel that working for dollar general you have no life besides the store. they leave one person to run an entire store. there were days when i was alone for 6-10 hours by myself, one its extremely unsafe and two its hard to work (put stock away, run register, and order items)"
good,Management overules everything.. Leave everything to do for cashiers. No raise unless you are key holder. Customers are complaints of  two slow. Mistreatment
good,"I had a very hard time working at Dollar general located near Moomoos, manger was very unappreciative and the coworkers were not team oriented and customers were always rude"
good,Dollar General is a fun place to work but it is tough to work with a group of coworkers (manager included) if they are forgetful. The work isn't evenly distributed.
good,"I liked working their because of the people i worked with. Bit dollar general really doesnt have any good benefits, it hard to move up because  their such a small  store, and you have to do the job of like 5 to 6 people. Got to be able to do many thinga at once."
good,"my manager was a chronic alcoholic who was pulled while I was working. In that, I understand that it wasn't Dollar General that was sexually harassing me. But I was still happy to leave."
good,The money need to match the hours people work there. The people was ok to work with customer in caneyville are very rude and disrespectful. Work very hard to change what I could I had to quit cause my daughter was having a baby and I could be at work and there as well not flexible as you would like.
good,It seems they will let anyone run a store. Poor management. One thing I couldn't stand was how messy the store was. Most stores were the same way. It could be better
good,"Worked at 2 different stores in different states. Depending on where you are, is how well your experience will be. In SC, management is fun and understanding, family orientated and understanding of unforeseen circumstances. In IL, management is unethical, degrading to employees and customers."
good,"Not paid enough to deal with everything they ask for, funky attitudes, terrible management, awful incentives. Just a flat out terrible business. Their turn over rate is very high."
good,"made sure store was clean at the end of the night made sure shelves were stoked, bathrooms where clean, and customers were taken well care of also made magnificent sales"
good,"I worked for Dollar General for about two years, nearly three years and received no raise. I started in Hinesville (great experience), but was then transferred to a Valdosta location( not so great experience) I was one of the most hard-working staff members on the team, and felt as if my time did not matter. I was a full-time college student and managed to work nearly or over 30 hours a week. I was not offered a raise or promotion once. The pay for the company is simply not enough. Dollar General is a good starting job for young people, but in my opinion should not be a long time career."
good,"Chaotic and Challenging, but yet fun for me, this is one of the things that I enjoy about Retail."
good,This place is a very stressful place to work. Employees don't last long and they don't pay you enough for all the rules and things you have to do. you work so hard for nothing pretty much.
good,"Could be a decent job but upper mgmt is constantly harping on hours when in fact the # of customers & workload required needs more workers. Trying to run at skeleton crew, not much training, and inventing new ways to display items when in reality customers just wanted a stocked store and a fast checkout. Disappointing."
good,Dollar Generals Management sucks. The managers have a God complex. The store is always getting robbed and the company will not hire security. The pay is mediocre at best. There is no such thing as a team effort. The managers take credit for every good thing that takes place at the store.  I wouldn't recommend unless you are just getting into the work force.
good,"It was fun to work there, made friends with the co workers. All except the store manager of my store. and corporate had no benefits for anything. all in all just an average job."
good,I was skipped over for a management opportunity twice. It was a good experience specifically dealing with customers. It is an entry level job with not much room for growth.
good,I did not care for this job all that much mostly because the General Manager I had at the time of me being hired was very sexist. She only hired females and when and if she hired a male she would blame anything that went wrong on them.
good,"I've   Had My First Paid Job Experience Here, I've learned a lot about my self in this chaotic environment. I've learned how to deal with all situations from a frustrated boss to rude customers."
good,at dollar general i would switch from working the cashier drawer and stocking the shelves. i would also sometimes go to the back room and count inventory
good,"I have found that, most managers of Dollar general store through out the country are not the brightest crayons in the box. I have experienced working with some doozies. One manager that I worked with was stealing merchandise and money, another one didn't even know how to use the cash register."
good,"Overall I loved my job at Dollar General, minus a few issues between upper management and reality inside the store. "
good,I liked the people but the job pay is low and too much work for the overall job and payroll. No room to excell and no discounts for employees. Old food.
good,"This asks me to be honest about the review of this company. I was a store manager, and I was assigned to a store that was already in bad shape. The given hours for this store sorely lacked in all aspects. There were times thanks to the staffing that I was running the entire store single-handed, which was not to be done. The support, or should I say the lack of support from the senior management can really hinder you. As a manager I was always working past the time that I was supposed to be home, and due to my own mistake, I was working after I had clocked out, as I had gotten involved with a project. The company terminated my employment for violation of company policy, and did not care to listen to my explanation. I would truly give thought to all of the pros and cons with this company before accepting a offer. I will not call it a trap, but I will say that it's not a forgiving or supportive company."
good,Overall the job was alright but at the end of the day i wasted more money going back and forth to work than i made. I put in my two weeks notice and quit because my manager never gave me any hours from the first week i was there until i left!
good,I enjoy meeting the people that comes in the store.  I do not get many hours 9-10 hours a week.  I would like to have more hours.
good,Some days i could not wait to get to work loved the people i worked with was a ok work environment some days when associates work and done there job.Management was not the best let to many people get away with to much one of the reason the store was never in order or clean like it needed to be.
good,I have been with the Company since Nov.2015 I have learned a lot in my short time there. I love the Job its not hard I am just looking for something closer to home and an advancement as well!
good,"arrive count and enter the amount of till in computer system, open register , stock, sign in small orders, count all tills of all cashiers and balance at end of night make sure tills set up for next day, enter information into computer for day and do deposit"
good,A typical day at work is only 4 hours for me as I am part time.  I'm a cashier and also have to stock shelves as well. I'm currently still working there but I am looking for somewhere else as I need full time.
good,"if you wanna run yourself to death, work here. you will be expected to run the floor and the register at the same time. noise-makers(attention getters) are not permitted yet you MUST operate register, sweep, mop, change trash, clean bathrooms, stock shelves, and place proper sales stickers all at once."
good,"I was in charge of half of the store on my shifts, cleaning, stocking, and cashier. I did not like that the store did not follow any of the state rules or Dollar General rules."
good,"I loved my job with Dollar General.  This job taught me a lot with customer service and working with others who did not like their jobs.  I learned time management , scheduling, and compromising with coworkers to make a better work environment that everybody could be happy working together. Hardest part of the job was learning that sometimes your upper management was not always what it seemed and had to learn to weed through what was truth and what was not."
good,"The company is ok if you are in school and lookign for something part time, but if you have afamily to take of I would not recomend."
good,"Depending on which store you work in, it can either be a good or bad place to work for. I disliked the store I worked in and I was unhappy working there."
good,"Easy work flow, Learned leadership, met a lot of great people by working with them and by customers that came in. Fun Environment to work in."
good,It's an ok job for someone starting out but their is not much room to move up at least their was not at the time I worked their. then their is also the fact that it did pay all that while during the time I work their. not sure if it has change or not.
good,i liked working there. It was a good job. They gave me the hours that I   wanted.
good,I'm learning there is a lot of gossip in this place. I like some of my coworkers but some also are rude. The best part of my job was meeting new people. Some management there is horrible.
good,"The environment was always bright when customers came in, Other employees were constantly being rude to the customers, and sometimes to me for no reason. The store was not very organized inside or outside. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the job done when most of the time I had to do co-workers jobs as well. It was very stressful at times. The most enjoyable part was getting to see the smiles of our customers and getting to know some of the regulars."
good,Really a job you want to start off with not a job one should look for after having jobs that pay above minimum wage.
good,My Best memories of this job was my Employees they are a great group very hard working
good,I wasn't happy at dollar general. I would get up go to high school spend 8 hours there and then have to go straight to work. from 3-10:30. I would have no time for homework. I would do this 6 out of the 7 day of the week.
good,Everything was done very fast. Which i like working fast but sometimes it can get a little over whelming.
good,"I stayed with the company because I was able to spend time with my children. But in a five year period, I only received twenty five cent raises per year. I was not allowed to work full time, they only allow up to 29 hours a week."
good,I worked 90 plus hours a week and never had enough help to get the work done that was required.
good,The dollar general I worked out was horrible. It felt like a small shop but without all the good things about a small shop and all the bad things about a larger one. The manager hated me for being a student and would try to find ways to fire me or to get me to quit. The only enjoyable part of the job was working with the people that came to shop.
good,Unless in management they do not give raises to their Stockers/sales associates.
good,Alot of work. Management really didn't care. Don't get advanced in the company unless your a favorite.
good,Its mcdonalds!! It basically full of teens and drama!! A place for somebody who is saving up for their first car!!
good,"Management was not honest "
good,"Opening day consist of reviewing last night paper works sales and what each cashier done for the day. Inventory certain know theft areas of the store. Plan a to do list for the store to accomplish for the day. "
good,"Many days you open the store alone and are running the business by doing multiple things at once, "
good,The job was very helpful in learning the retail aspect of the business and dealing with different personalities.
good,"They treat their employees badly, expect you to know everything about the job. The DM don't do anything about their store mangers who show up drunk or high."
good,"Came in counted drawer down for the start of backup cashier. In mornings I would do the paperwork until the open of the day. I would stock in the morning times. In the evening, I would straighten the store up from the days work load. The co-workers were great to get along with. We were like a little family. The hardest part of the job was getting everyone on the same page for the backroom and the stock."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General started as soon as I walked through the door.  I did learn a lot about managing inventory and what it takes to make customers happy.  The customers were by far the best part of working at Dollar General.  However, the store was poorly managed and there was very little room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at my job, I run register, do the assistant managers job, and also stock shelves. I have learned how to be an assistant manager. My co-workers are terrific, we work well as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people daily. "
good,"good learning experience, had alright hours, was a really demanding company, didnt have much of a life, almost worked every weekend "
good,"Shift change begins immediately upon arrival and almost never goes smoothly. Because the register drawer is already counted to $100, the newly shifted in clerk must assume the drawer actually has an exact monetary count of $100 at the start. The newly shifted clerk is completely responsible for the drawer having $100 regardless if it actually has that correct amount. This is alarming to me as I am forced to assume the drawer's accuracy without having been able to actually confirm the monetary count before starting my shift."
good,"Good part-time employment, but not career potential. It was a good job to learn more about you community and help my neighbors from a customer service stand point."
good,A typical day at work is checking customers out and recovering/ stocking. I learned how to work with rude customers and management. My co-workers were ohkay. The job was pretty easy. I really didn't enjoy the job. I was very uncomfortable
good,The pay was at minimum wage or .25 or .50 cents above. There are benefits if you can survive the months of low hours. It takes about a year to qualify for benefits. We were expected to get a lot of stock work done in a short amount of time. We were expected to plus sell and ask for charitable donations from some of the poorest people in town. One of the managers provided the cashiers with counterfeit detection pens.
good,a lot of older people working here
good,basically i come in and stay on the register because the manager is always in the back and wen i need something they take forever to respond.
good,"Store manager is a compulsive liar,this is probably the worst job I've ever had"
good,A typical day was counting the draws for the cashiers and then the bank at the end of the night. I was promoted from cashier to second key holder. The management was alright they just needed to learn to get their jobs done. Hardest part of the job was trying to make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.
good,"Other workers are not productive nor helpful, lack of communication to employees, not shift flexible, Also most enjoyable part was nothing because there was no encouragement at that workplace."
good,Great for a part time job if you have other sources of income. Not ideal to try and sustain off of. Constant scheduling changes and miscommunication. Hours can range from 0-20. I enjoyed the environment but it is not an ideal job to put your faith and trust into.
good,Dollar General is a company that leads by intimidation and retains by desperation..... the corporate side of the company ride their store managers to meet payroll and physically and mentally gets on to them and makes them feel if they don't complete their job they will get fired
good,"Have almost everything "
good,The pay for an assistant store manager is low. The company was always cutting hours. So couldn't keep workers that was worth anything because of no hours to give. Did all the store managers work plus mine. To many resets every week and not enough time. Very stress full job.
good,Most days i am alone sometimes for 2-3 hours. I am scheduled every saturday which is the day where you take the old ads down and put new ones up.i have asked my manager repeatedly for at least 1 saturday night off but she absolutly refuses. I hate that there is only 1-2 people per shift expecially when im alone and a vender comes in or when a customer comes in with their million coupons.
good,"They want from you - more and more.  However, unless you are management, it does not matter what you think or do.  I found that we had few people to work and a lot of product to get out as well as run registers.  It was not uncommon to have just one person working for hours by themselves having to do everything."
good,"Love it there,til got new manager.manager drank on job,accuses workers of stealing,profiles no white customers,yells,screams..treat employees badly..."
good,"Dollar general is definitely somewhere to work if you don't enjoy your job, the management sucks and the store is dirty. Nobody did leave work leaving it to carry over to the next shift."
good,My limited time was filled with quick and imperfect training. Called in before I even had training or work attire and expected to know the processes. Expected to work at same speed as long time employees
good,"Working for Dollar General was fine. It was basically what you can expect from any retail store. The people I met had been nice and courteous, but while I was employed there Management lacked severely as my manager had quit a few weeks after I started."
good,I just started and i opened during a snow day on my day off where i needed to contact other employees to get keys since i had none of my own. I feel liable for the company and at fear for keeping my job at the same time due to inner work drama and lack of structure. It has not been something that has helped balance anything with the rest of my life and general health.
good,"Great company if you get placed in the right store with the right DM. If not, your work life balance is non-existent. You will constantly receive phone calls from the store on your days off."
good,I have little to complain about except for my manager. She never gave me a weekend off and never let me work 1st shift. The schedule was constantly changing without warning. She took credit for her employees hard work. Never acknowledged us for anything. Was constantly threatened to be wrote up for my drawer being a little off even though it wasn't. I'd have someone else count it. I was never more than a few cents off.
good,"Younger female managers disrespectful.     Specifically Monroe,Oregon location. Put their personal and job stresses on the other workers as well as allowing customers to hear their whining about the unfairness they feel about their job responsibilities as a manager. Poor communication."
good,"Being with dollar general for over 2 years I have worked with many mangers. But, the old manger I worked for did not know how to do his job correctly. I have seen many good workes leave because of him and sadly I am one of them."
good,"Dollar generall expects too much from workers there would be times i would be the only worker on the clock and have 30+ customers in the store, it made it extreamly difficult to stock shelves, check in vendors, help customers find what they needed and run the register all at once"
good,"It was a good experience poor management work. Didn't want to give hours, doesn't inform employees of any Inspections. Management does know how to communicate. Very LITTLE ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT"
good,"I personally wasn't fond of my manager, but the company themselves are willing to work with college schedules. Its a great company overall. I did learn many different things about my coworkers and the managers and what their jobs are."
good,"If your a male in a all female store, get ready to do ALL the lifting, From Upper Management to Cashiers, if its heavy females refuse to lift it, reguardless if its Managment giving them a list of things to do.. If your chummy with Female Store Manger you get away with anything, Key holders do as they please, and key holders nark on other employees,  key holders get more hours then Assistant Store Manager does."
good,There is little organization and proper communication with management and higher ups. Important things not getting fixed. High employee turnover and horrible compensation.
good,Ok place to work manager doesn't like to do much store is dirty and unorganized and messy need more laborhours for emo plows or something our they need better employees
good,I didn't like working at Dollar General. I liked it first but then I started to like it less and less. All the managers are not the same ones I don't think a lot of the same people I don't work there anymore I kind of like the managers.
good,"Good until 2017 we had a management change.They cut hours. I was getting 5 hours a WEEK. The store was a MESS,and stock was expiring. Not enough staff."
good,"This company has no idea what it's doing. if you're okay with that and want to work part time as a cashier with low expectations from the company and your wages then it's fine but otherwise, the only real upsides to working here were getting paid weekly and working as little or as much as i want. management was terrible and so was the pay, no culture to speak of, no advancement to speak of but i guess your job is secure because no one wants it if that means anything"
good,"My last location I was customer service, stock, exterminator, and janitor."
good,"The pay was not worth the work, the benefits were to expensive and upper management was severely lacking. I would not recommend it to a person with financial responsibilities."
good,It really depends how things are going to go on how good of a store manger you have. I been there for over a year and 2 store mangers i have had was great. But 1 i had was really a bad manger and played favorites.
good,"Slow paced, but many hours available. You'll get called in alot, but if you need the extra money that is a benefit. No benefits and hardly any advancement opportunities. Good I between job."
good,I worked with great people who trained me even when we had no manager for a short period of time we all made the best of it. Would love to go back if I had the chance
good,U can't pick the days u work u can't pick ur hours u work and u dont get enough hours to even pay ur bills they say ur pay was going to this amount then it's not
good,Reason being I was hired at the Albert Pike location in Hot Springs Arkansas and the day I was hired there was thing that no one let alone a manager should have said racist comments her and her significant other having conversations about my genitals and then coming back to the store and telling me about it I had to stop my significant other from confronting her about it because I was trying to keep my job but this has got to be spoken on
good,"Was a lead sales associate for a small town dollar general and was always on call for the most part so never got much time off, schedule was always changing could do overnight frieght one night and next day open."
good,"This job had its ups and downs, seemed more like downs due to lack of communication and support. Corporate never really took the time to listen and understand the concerns of the store employees and store managers. They never gave enough hours to run a store properly when sales were noticeably high."
good,I have a blast working helping meeting other people I really enjoy it I wish the pay could have been better and I think it could have of the manager would have push the issue I was always working I went in on off days I work in the weekends.i would love to work for them again if the pay was right
good,The job was actually awesome and quite enjoyable just had a homophobe manager. So the actual job was easy and laid back just the management at the time was not a good look
good,"This lead position is just like a supervisor position, always in charge for morning to night. Even if I wasn’t at work I was at work type of job. Same requirements as any sales associate."
good,One of the worst jobs I ever had.  Too much expected of employees with little time and low pay.  Open door policy they claim to have is non existent.  Upper management is terrible.
good,It's an ok job doesn't pay that much and most often they'll just train you for like 20mins then they tell you your on your own. Wouldn't recommend for kids in or straight out of high school.
good,My 1st manager he was cool  then the new manager came in and they dropped me down to 4 hours a week so that wasn't even worth my time so I left went from 40 plus hours down to 4 hours just like that nothing worth my time going to work for 4 hours a week so I left i will never work there specially the one in Adam's Massachusetts The manager we had there was lazy fat slob
good,I didn’t like Closing with 2 people near midnight with no security. Seems like there is never enough staff for emergency call in. Store never stays clean.
good,Special circumstances escalated customer base while our store lacked sufficient personnel.  This lead to an increase in product losses and general cleanliness of store.
good,Good place to work for! Management is underpaid for the hours they spend in the store! Very high demanding and quick pace environment! Have to be a multitasker to work for Dollar General.
good,"I've worked for the company twice...the first time was a awesome experience with management....we had team meetings....but then a old friend of one started and was very disrespectful ,and touchy feely with female employees.he was reported nothing done."
good,They do not give enough help to keep the store stocked and clean. They need more than one cashier to help with customers. They do not give enough hours to cover all the shifts to make the store look and run better and faster. All of my customers are very friendly. The manager at my store is a very nice man. I worked with him for 8 years at Save A Lot. We make a good team at getting stuff done but have to work alot.
good,"Not a good company to work for, if u are a manager you will be spending more time at your store than with your own family, they expect you to work as much as 4 normal people combined"
good,The reason I quit is because I would only get one day a week and it just wasn't enough for me to go on and the manager would just criticize everything I did my coworkers were good had no complaints
good,"I loved it , until I had many of bad run ins with another manager. Tried to get everyone fired. Started problems with people that came in and out. Was full of drama. But a good place and they take care of you. I have to take off From work for a whole week my manager let , because it was a family emergency , she brought me back on the schedule right away when I was ready."
good,At first it was great! But after 3 years upper management changed so many times you could not  keep up with all the changes. I had 11 district managers in 5 years. I had a great team that stayed with me in my store. we had great customers and it was a real busy store.
good,A typical day was always busy. I learned it takes a kind and professional person to be a cashier. The management was okay. The workplace culture was unstable. The hardest part about the job was trying to find time to stock while also doing cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the people from the community and advancing my people skills.
good,I worked here for 6 years and did my job as a store manager to have a new district manager (female) come in and get jealous and lie it's sad that you put your heart and soul into something to only have it thrown in your face bc of jealousy...I would never recommend anyone there..
good,"You’re honestly up and down in this job, you’re lucky if you even get a good break. It was too much drama for me I was there to work not to be talked down on, but at the end of the day I got a really good paycheck."
good,"I don't know where to start. Work days would consist of covering both the register and stocking/recovery, as there was usually only 2 employees working at a time. I will say that management was on top of recovery and properly stocked shelves, but lacked the ability to critique an employee without yelling and/or berating said employee in front of customers then gossiping behind everyone's back. I left before management had a chance to turn their lack of professionalism on me. The other co-workers, however, were wonderful to work with. They were always supportive and kind. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours and lack of true pay raise in my future. I received a small raise when I took on manager on duty, but was told by several others that would be the last."
good,"Management is absolute garbage, I was treated extremely unfair for no reason. The store manager always felt the need to make me feel like I didn't belong at the store, she always had to belittle me. None of the employees at my store were ever able to get along, we had drama and serious issues every other day. The worst part of the job is getting in trouble for not doing enough on seriously busy days. The best part of the job is the good customers that are genuinely nice and supportive."
good,"I was with dollar general for a while, and within my time being there, I got promoted. Twice. District manager doesn't really care about your life outside store, so Bumped heads alot because I was a full time student and school IS my main  priority and would come and just pick on my store manger when store was ALWAYS cooperate visit ready."
good,"I loved working with MOST of my co workers but the district manager had very poor management skills. Instead of telling you what you did wrong and a better way to do it, she would just tell you what you did wrong and write you up."
good,Its a decent starter job just needs new people and better working environment. And needs more opportunitys to move up in the ranks. The choices should be made by how much you do how hard you work not somthing else.
good,Dollar general has a lot of issues. The company doesn’t care about their employees only their managers. Having a good management team is like winning the lottery. The store I’m at is very busy most days and we are always understaffed. The need to call your manager up for voids and returns gets annoying fast because at a busy store you have this happening A LOT. Management is a clique and if you aren’t in it or at least somewhat liked you will get treated like dirt. Drama between employees is common and if you have one coworker who is lazy but kisses managements butt you can expect that coworker to get away with everything. The pay is a JOKE! Minimum wage for the job of 2 people. You work totes and run register. If you aren’t fast enough with totes management will get angry at you and if you aren’t right there at the register when the customer is ready they get an attitude. You can’t win either way if you’re a cashier. Hours vary every week and you can get 30 one week and 15 the next. You don’t get any discounts or paid vacation. Only work for this company if you are desperate.
good,Lots of work little time to accomplish little help. I ran a busy store hard to balance everything that needs to be done and run register without pulling out your hair. Overall I loved working there just wish they would allow more hours in budget for help
good,Job was good for the first couple of months. Manager was on leave and a fill in was taking over. When the Manager came back from leave everything went downhill. She treated employees horribly. She was very two faced and racist! Loved to change schedules without notice.
good,Try to hide the fact you get hart on the job.. Force you to work with dr.note that excuses you from work. And pay very low for what your worth make you pick work over family and your on life
good,It was a decent job not something I felt I could make a career out of but I only went there to work part time but they found out I had management experience and made me keyholder and bumped my hours up
good,"It was a stressful place to work. They put way too much work on its employees and expect them to get it all done in a short time period. Leads have to do key turns, answer the phone, help customers, and get all their work done in a matter of 6 and a half hours. the managers all make it more stressful by fussing at the wrong person and not yelling at the ones who stand around and do absolutely nothing."
good,The good thing working in retail is you learn how to handle social situations and difficult customers. I learned a lot for this being my first job out of school.
good,It’s a good job to start off with as a college student but the pay is not there especially if your are part time. You are paid weekly but the hours are just not there for stockers
good,"This is a good place to work but at times it can be both chaotic and stressful and toxic. "
good,"I've been with Dollar General for 5 years. I started as a part time cashier and quickly rose to ASM. However I believe it was as much the high turnover as my work ethic. I have given them 200 percent the whole time. It was immediately evident that I was more capable of running a store than the manager.  This is still the situation. My manager is hateful, doesn't follow the 7 day work flow, keep up with Start, is a slob, doesn't make schedules, lies, blames their failures on others and is vengeful. I have witnessed my managers unfairness daily for a little over 2 years now. Yet he gets accolades for looking good because I'm busting my butt everyday to make him look good. It's my job. I have gone to upper management when his actions are crippling the store and they have addressed that but he has no idea it was me that got us on track. I have not been promoted because he gives me bad evaluations because he says they will take me away from him. I have no home life at all. I work like I'm on salary but get my hours stolen by him come payroll day. I am actively seeking employment elsewhere."
good,"Steady rearranging store, stocking shelves, pay is minimum wage and they expect really hard work. Manager I had was hard to deal with, always complained and started drama with co workers."
good,"I personally feel that it is poorly run. The pay is little but the job and expectations is big. You are suppose to get a raise after the first 90 days, never happened. There isn't anybody above the store manager that is willing to help when things aren't right."
good,College student only working there part time currently. I am only working there as a way of affording my expenses outside of being a full time student.
good,The management is most definitely not the best. They expect the employees to drop their lives for Dollar General. Management does not post schedules until the day before and then tries to continue changing it after it’s posted without letting employees know.  However the regular customers are the absolute best!
good,There is alot to that job. You have alot of product to unload off the u boats. Some days we would have to take 2 hour lunches without pay cause we were over on hours. Always had to be someone in store with key.  So couldn't even leave for lunch.
good,was temp to hire was being trained  to load trucks one of the trainers told supervisor I made  a comment about keeping up was let go all the other trainers said I was doing a good job very unfair after only 3 days of training
good,I worked for the company for over 6 years. Liked the customer relations I had with the company. Learned a lot of things working for this company. Helped me to have a better understanding of the business world.
good,"Dollar General's work culture is overall very demanding. You are assigned multiple tasks without designated or sufficient time to complete them. However, I've made some lifelong friends working there. If you are young and looking for your first job, I would recommend giving Dollar General a try."
good,"Running the cash register, stocking the shelves, cleaning the store, helping the customers and unloading the truck. The hardest part was trying to do all of these things with in a 3 to 5 hour shift. The best thing was working and helping the customers. The other thing was most of the time it is only one or two employees working at a time, except when unloading the truck."
good,Management was terrible. Despite management it was an okay place to work. I was told to clean the restrooms one day and it looked as if they had never been cleaned. Management got after me for taking too long. In the end they left the restroom a mess.
good,"Although Dollar General may not be one of the largest retail stores out there, it would fall on a very small group to try and maintain the entire store. It would often be two people ( one associate and one manager) trying to handle everything. Daily routines would be running the cash register, zoning the entire store, watching for thefts, greeting customers, doing cash drops, working freight and cleaning the store, all while providing great customer service. It would often start to feel like a lot for such few people."
good,"If you don't have a family would like to work insane hours with a lack of quality help then it's the place for you. I could only get 2 good associates when someone called it was on me to always cover. And everyone called in because they didn't want to actually do any work, motivation couldn't be given because they did not want to show. Associates usually looking for most money with the least amount of work. I will say managers understood but couldn't help due to other stores failing as well."
good,"the management is absolutely horrible, the manager had no idea what he was doing. didn't know how to reset endcaps, do payroll on time and the schedule was always messed up and changed without the employees knowing"
good,Responsible for stocking duties and running cash register as needed. Worked in warehouse to unload truck. placed merchandise on shelves. ran cash register
good,"Depending on where your store is located and how much foot traffic it receives will determine how fast paced your work ethic has to be."
good,The hours were inconsistent and they kept trying to send me to other stores in order to get any hours at all. It was just not a good job for someone seeking stability
good,"Was OK for those who didn't attend school, the enjoyable part was learning new staff and socializing with customers. Busy over the day. i'm glad I got some retail experience"
good,I do not think the dollar general i worked at was a good place to work. It had terrible management and no respect for other employees that were working there.
good,"In my opinion Dollar General is a great company and has great deals for their customers but they may need to hire better managers,. Everyone is not meant to work with others. Some managers do not take it into consideration that we have a personal life outside of work. I have three kids and I could only work in the day time because I had no one to take care of my daughters at night and the manager only gave me 2 days with four hours each day. In reality, that is not enough hours for me to pay bills and take care of my household. This was my first job out of high school and both managers I ever worked with were horrible."
good,The original manager retired and a new one stepped up. All sales associates and key holders quit because they did not agree with how the manager did things. The district manager was fired so they got a new one and he does not care how sales associates are treated. He thinks that manager is always correct even when shes not doing her job.
good,"In the 6 months I worked there, I feel as if I could have been the store manager.  They do work you hard and there is always something to do, which makes your shift go by quickly!  They seriously need to review their management policies and procedures.  Not a good place to work if you're looking for job advancement."
good,"The manager I was under wouldn't schedule me with cowworks that had no problem taking me too and from work, is why I left................ ..workers where great"
good,"When i started at DG I was poorly trained. Was not even interviewed. The company obviously does not care about its workers...only the customers. "
good,"We averaged 60 hours a week to work, We worker 7 day a week some times. I learned all processes of running a DG. from open to close. stocking , Inventory, ordering . There was never enough hours "
good,"i learned how to take care of my customers at the register "
good,Manger of the store was nasty. Kept Making moves on the employees and harassing them. Taking there hours away. Stealing . He was a very nasty man. I would never work at this one dollar store
good,Job can be very stressful the higher heads have no heart for the people actually working in the store. They want you to do a million things in four hours or you’re going to be written up. You work hard for mediocre pay.
good,"needs people in managment that care about the store "
good,I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. I liked getting to meet new people and talking to the regular customers. I would not have left had they had different management.
good,I went thru several store managers while working there never once did I have a problem. Until the last store manager. I went from at least 30 hours a week to lucky to get 12 hours. We only had me and one other male working there at the time she came in. She then started favoring all the females and she tried everything to get us to quit or to fire us. It came to the point where 12 hours a week would be 6 hours a week. I have a family I have to support I have a wife and 4 children and we cant make it with our bills and everyday living on 6 hours a week.
good,"Its a good job to start off with. The customers were always the best part of my day/night. Although I worked more than what I got paid for, I still loved it."
good,"It's not just cashiering, it's stocking, cashiering, helping customers find items, watching for theft, placating management while they were on continuous smoking breaks"
good,Overall the company isnt terrible but their management could use some work. They have too many Store managers and District managers who do not care about their employees and only do things to benefit themselves. They make it hard to move up in the company and they so favoritism.
good,"putting up with people when something is not in stock, trying to do a task given and stopped to do another one without finishing the first one and then getting yelled at for not having it done"
good,"Dollar General is not complicated job, it is quite easy actually. I had a good manager. The most enjoyable part was working with people. The least enjoyable was one manager who did not seem to like me very well and treated me like an imbecile."
good,"I had to resign because there was another assistant manager who was literally threatening me and making accusations about my character, which was unaccepatable to me"
good,"They need to give the stores mores hours to get stuff done and to help provide better customer service.They put to much on the manager's and they need to get their bsr, under control. They put to much freight in the stores and half or more they don't need."
good,my shift varied depending on what the manager didn't want
good,Not an idea place to work if you are looking for advancement and higher pay.  You don't get many hours in fact you are more likely to on receive 20 or less hours a week.
good,Great place to work but at the time I worked there the manager was stealing merchandise and we all got let go. He was found guilty and no charges on us.
good,"They weren’t horrible and I do not blame the company for what happened at our local Dollar General, but the management was lacking. There wasn’t much training or help understanding."
good,"Just poor management, lack of professionalism. Lack of stores repairs. District Managers dont enforce safety protocol. Inconstant work hours for full timers like me. Store manager blames higher up for low hours."
good,this job was not to good for me. to many hours a week way over 65 a week to work here then they would all ways cut the pay role down so you would work a store by your self all day so they can save a dollar.
good,this job is production based. you must want to work to stay at this job. it is very hot during the summer with only fans blowing and very cold in the winter.
good,Never any hours you can get. Hard to work around lfenif you have children. Although this was just my experience. This was a few years ago. Don't knock it till you try it.
good,"The work was always tedious. Every day was different. Unfortunately,  no one wanted to work there. The hardest part of the job, hiring, eventually everyone I had hired, had quit on me. There was weeks where I could not get a single day off. The second hardest was the having to ""throw"" your own truck on a weekly basis while attending the register. Tons of overstock accumulated and virtually no where to put it."
good,Needs Scurity in high crime areas. Other than that its a great place to work and meet new people. Workload is not very demanding. It fast paced but steady.
good,"As having dollar general as a job, I felt like it wasn't what I expected. Online there website said that the closing time is at 9:00pm. That was the biggest as to why I applied there. But my first day, it was close to 9:00pm and realize that many people are still coming, then I asked my manager, what time we close. She said the closing time is at 10:30pm. I was confused, but went along with it. And everytime I work, I usually get home at about 11:30pm. I did enjoy working there for the money, but I was missing out on everything and usually when I work, I'm expected to know what exactly what to do and as it was my first day, I was asked all these questions from cutsomers and had some problems with the cash register and took a while to get used to the cash register because my manager was working on the floor all times and the pace I went was slow because I didn't know what to do. I never had a day or more of training, I was just expected to know what to do."
good,They only pay you minimum wage. My management never gave me enough hours to pay my bills. The last month I worked the I was getting like 14 hours a week maybe. No Benefits whats so ever unless your management.
good,"Dollar General is not the place to work if you want work life balance. they offer no sick pay to the managers, and they must work 48-50 a week, but the way DG has it set up for them you only get 1 day off a week. There is absolute nothing but work with them no work life balance at all"
good,The place i worked at a supervisor was trying to get me fired for false information. Everything was taught different by different people of the stores. i worked with all girls so their wasnt any guys. as well as family members would help them with their stuff and i wouldn't get any help.
good,"A typical day at work included being a key carrier/Manager with access to safes "
good,Don’t get paid enough as a ASM Store Manager takes in 60000 while you make between 12-15 a hour and can do everything he can do while he ask you to do everything They hire SM that cant do the job which leads to a high turnover rate instead of promoting from within
good,A typical day at work included being a key carrier with access to safes 
good,"Dollar General was not that bad of a place to work at. Depending on the co-workers and where you work, you tend to meet nice people and it makes the job way easier to deal with."
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work if you like being underpaid for the work you perform. The job isn't hard to master, running a register is simple and floor work is just busy work. Dealing with customers, however, can be challenging and upper-management doesn't like to assist with busy hours or long lines at the register. If you plan to move up in retail or grocery store business, Dollar General is a great place to work, but it's a stressful one to handle."
good,"With all the money this company makes, I you would never assume they would have such a huge problem with the budget for scheduling their employees. They also ask that an employee does way more than they should considering the undesirable pay rate for hourly employees and their horrible benefits packages."
good,I opened and closed by myself. the people that came in were nice to me. the maniger hated me and complained about everything that I did even tho people was loving how clean it was.they would not give me a raise.
good,"A typical day is being a cashier, restocking shelves, properly handling money, doing returns, exchanging items & cleaning anything that needs to be(including bathrooms). The customer is always right regardless of the situation. Management differs with the manager. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers & having lines of angry customers backed up through the store & usually the system would crash at a time like that."
good,"Manage the store and the employees.  Go to the bank, do financial daily reports and post the results, hire and fire, train employees.  Market to the community, merchandise the products, deal with vendors, do credits and debits.  I learned to deal with different customers rather they were upset or unhappy.  Have meeting with upper management and employees.  Clean the store."
good,In my interview I told them I didn't care how they scheduled me as long as I had 2 days off a week. My manager seemed like she was on a power trip and would always give her best friend 3 days off while I was only getting 1. I left the job because I had a better offer.
good,"If you work very hard, there is a little room for advancement. Would be okay for a first job, but pay is minimum wage starting out. Of course, the better your co-workers, the faster your day will go. Fairly typical retail job."
good,not for people looking to retire. there are no health benefits- no insurance worth the premiums. there are never enough hours to do the assigned work duties required.
good,"Its a good job and good experience. but don't get sick they will fire you becuase you cant come into work, because you have a fever and may have the flu."
good,Management works a lot of hours. Pay isn't good for hourly associates. Not enough employees to get the job done.  No work life balance. Employees can't be with family on holidays
good,"It was a job that gave me a paycheck. There were a few things about the job that I enjoyed like my co-workers that I worked with. The management wasn't the best. The hardest part of the job was having availability outside of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers, they would brighten my day every time they came in."
good,There isn't a lot of room for growth in this company as the positions are limited.  It is a good place to work for students whom will be moving on to other places.
good,I would love to express that this establishment needs some better management and benefits. I am grateful that I was hired but not grateful with the results
good,It is an okay good for a short time especially if a part-time student I college. Time moves slow and only get a 30 minute lunch break for standing 7 hours a day.
good,"Retail is a very tough career. Dollar General is not a horrible place to work for, it just depends on your coworkers and managers. The customers are what builds the experience of retail. Dollar General is very demanding when it comes time to receive truck and put out stock. Holidays are also very demanding. If you get along well with your coworkers and you have good customers,your retail experience should be good."
good,The problem the Dollar General is that the manger dose not have anymore skills then you do. They always show up late and you would have to cover for them.
good,"This  is  a  fast  paste  job,  they  work  u  hard,  except  u  to  have  everything  dont  on  time  and  looking  good.  It's  a  good  job  just  a  lot  of  stress  on  u."
good,"I've been there 9 months and we had just been robbed No one cares. I think the key holder was in on it, and they refuse to up my pay ,or transfer me. They don't do their jobs I mostly put stock up and clean the store."
good,"Not a great job that pays well enough to support a decent living, not much room for advancement. If you're not a store manager or assistant manager it's pretty much a dead end job. The starting pay is minimum wage and since hours are always limited, it's just not enough for the work that you have to do."
good,"My experience working for the Dollar General in TN, was horrible. The GM was selfish and made many mistakes. I would not work for her ever again. DG as a company I liked pretty well. They need to consider raising their pay rate to meet standards. The amount of work that goes into being an employee for DG deserves a higher amount of pay."
good,"My review of this job was it had poor management, the manager was a racist and bully. I was a great cashier and stocker with great customer service. I loved all of my customers."
good,"I really don't have much to say about dollar general. its not that bad of a job to work at. its good if you are just wanting some extra hours, but that's about it. wouldn't recommend it to be a career job though."
good,"Very few of the my employee's ever wanted to show up for work and when they did, they were unproductive and unmotivated. It made work less than happy, and to top that off, the management didn't care and rode the 2 employees who would work which lead to them leaving."
good,Working here was truly an experience.  I had good coworkers that were willing to help you with whatever you needed.  Customer service was important and we strived to be the our best.
good,Upon excepting this job i didn't realize that i would only be working 12 a week. Only to have to sit by the phone and wait to be called in you cant plan your day or week cause you don't know if you'll be called in or not. Many of the people work here were brought in by the manager from her old store with every one of them being made assistant manager.
good,Full time is between 30 and 37 hours. No overtime allowed. Benefits are awful. Hourly payroll budget is awful. But it is a fun place to work. I love the stress and the deadlines and the challenges. And I absolutely adore my amazing manager.
good,"i was a cashier. i would come in and clean up or stalked shelves and just wait for people to come in. This was not a very exciting job and sometimes a bit scary, i would have to be there by myself sometimes and we would get people of all walks of life."
good,"Overall not an ideal place to work at if you need money and intend on growth. Being there for 3 years I was able to improve work skills and manage a college schedule as well. However, it's how you can take it, it's a nice job to pay bills and to have on the side but to make a main job with the low pay isn't the right move."
good,To me it's a careless store that I worked for. There mangment is sloppy and unorganized they can't keep employees very long. The store always had food carts and boxes in the iels.
good,I enjoyed the job itself but at the time i worked there i wasnt able to work more than 15 or 20 hours a week. the manager at the time was also extremely rude both to employees and customers.
good,"Sometimes it would be great, others it was hard to work there. Especially when nobody but you would do there job.  Your job was always threatened. Especially if it was your day off & they wanted you to come in but you try to tell them no because you want to spend time with your kids."
good,"The job isn’t as bad, it’s just the people there. Their the messiest set of people I have ever encountered. And I’m a kind of to myself person and I never have anything to bad to say about people, but I really dislike most of the people I work with everyday."
good,I think that the Dollar General corporation is a great company and wonderful to work with. However the lower level management I experienced was terrible. He would change the schedule and not notify the employees. The building was small and cramped. Now that the store has a new manager I love to shop there. It has since majorly improved.
good,"Start pay regardless of past experience is minimum wage. Most the managers that I've met are ""you work when I tell you to"" and don't care about your availability."
good,There was a high expectancy of your the the pay was not enough to compensate the hard work to keep the store clean and functional and profitable. It is always located in high crime areas were the theft is high. The hours allotted for the stores are ridiculous. Keeping up with freight and theft then became a issue because you cant have the man power because of the hours issue. The workers only game you minimum wage work because that is what they was paid. The good people was hard to keep.
good,They don't have enough registers to keep the traffic flowing smoothly to keep the customer happy and not enough space in the store it keep up the demand from stock
good,Not a place to work if you're needing to support a family but a great place for a first job.  Enjoyed meeting people and helping customers. Wish coworkers would have put in a little more effort.
good,"Not consistent in hours, job duties. Not paid fairly for the job that needed to be done. Left in stores alone at times. Does not ensure safety of managers."
good,I enjoyed working there but I got fired because I couldn't keep up with the fast pace as well as my register was either over or under the amount needed each night.
good,My overall experience was a solid 2/5 because some management thought it was okay to treat other staff inappropriately and talk down to other staff and the higher up management neglected to follow through with the allegations made on certain staff members.
good,"For the most part, the customers are wonderful, however it is getting dangerous.  The company does not care about the employee wellbeing.  The longer you work for them the worse you are treated"
good,"My day starts with handling money and running the register. Along with complete different around the store including but not limited to helping customers, checking in vendors, instructing cashiers, dealing with customer service, and any other problems that may occur."
good,"I went from 35+ hours, to less than 20 weekly due to lack of sales, and being over/staffed. Schedule frequently changed throughout the week. The hours & pay weren't worth the headache."
good,A typical day included working the register and restocking when you weren't busy assisting customers or running the register. Some days were spent unloading the trucks. I learned customer service skills. The supervisor was wonderful and always hard working but upper management was very disorganized and put a lot of pressure on the supervisor to constantly work and travel. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unkind customers or creepy men who thought it was okay to hit on a woman when they were at least twenty years older than me. I enjoyed interacting with my co workers and most of the customers and liked when I got to restock shelves.
good,Working for this company can be very rewarding with the right team.  The customers are very appreciative of your service and knowledge of merchandise and weekly sales.
good,"The job is not that hard, i learned a lot with this being my first management position. I didn't much care for the people i work with only a few, I don't thing the manger where that great I think they could of ran the store a little better."
good,Dollar General isn't an awful place to work. I enjoyed it a lot. The customers were amazing and the work wasn't too stressful. The worst part about it was that I was REFUSED time off for a funeral I needed to attend. The district manager demanded I be there and I was given 1 day off for a 3 day funeral. She did not care about my well-being.
good,Bad place to work. management doesn't train you at all and expects you to know everything in 1 day or hours will be cut massively. Managers are Two-faced.
good,It was really hard and stressful when I started the customer where nice.some of the employers was a little rude but I didn't reallybother them the manager was alright but was a really hard worker and respectful
good,working at dollar general was kind of a breeze until they changed the management staff. ive leaned that dollar general could be a good place if its surrounded with great staffing.
good,If you are perfect you will fit in. There were way too many things needed to be perfect and it's not humanly possible. No matter what we did it wasn't good enough.
good,Dollar general is an okay work place if you want an alright paycheck every week. Weren't as flexible and the pay was not the greatest being a key holder. Did learn a lot with dealing with everyday issues and customers. Being a key holder taught me a lot of responsibility.
good,"ok place to work if you are a hard worker, give a fair wage for manager position, not sure of support to employees,  not good at promoting god people from within"
good,Never a set schedule. Cashiers received more hours than supervisors. Dangerous place to work. Overall the manager was very fair when it came to hiring people of all races.
good,"a typical day at work , people came in stealing , and we had no security in there knowing about the crime daily so i had to monitor the register and play security at the same time , i also learned how to stock properly and be a cashier , the most enjoyable thing about the job is that i lived not too far from the workplace so i could get there in less than 5 minutes walking."
good,"unprofessional place of employment at this particular store.  Manager picks favorites, terrorizes others. Stress level is above the roof due to managers anger."
good,"A typical work day is knowing what your tasks are and completing them in a timely manner. I have learned how to multi-tasks in a very busy workplace, as far as dealing with customers and trying to stock the shelves. Management speaks for it self some of maanagers work and some don't just be mindful of when you work for certain ones that try to make you do there work. The hardest part I would have to say dealing with some customers."
good,"A very hectic work environment. I enjoy most of the customers."
good,"The days at dollar general are very long. Shoplifting is a constant worry that distracts you from your work. My GM was one of the worst individuals I have ever dealt with. Corporate allowed him to get away with things that go against every level of business ethics. He tried his hardest to get under everyone's skin, and treated the business like a playhouse. The only enjoyable part about working at Dollar General is meeting nice customers."
good,"I did not enjoy the job itself, but i did enjoy the companionship of the customers. We had repeat customers daily that you knew by name. I  didnt like the way the company was run."
good,"it was nice to work so close to home, but what a turnover. and expect way too much from employees. with a threatening management staff as well, aaaaaa"
good,"they are too cheap to have the air conditener,hours aren't enough to pay bills I would always have to drive to other stores to make thirty hous just to pay bill"
good,"This job had to be one of the most trialing jobs I've had. There were times where I felt like I was doing EVERYTHING in the store. I've had to keep a check on the foods simply because they weren't rotated properly. It's a lot of work for very little compensation. And don't even bother asking for a pay raise after you've been there for a year. It'll just get denied. Most people aren't worth an extra $.25 center on their check I guess, assuming that you come to work on time, never had any behavior issues, etc."
good,First job after having my son. Did not offer the hours that I needed to continue working there and did not offer benefits. Great for a first time job or student.
good,Good first job for someone starting out. Everyday is about the same and not much changes. Management is okay at best but not easily reliable. Working holiday and weekends doesn't make for a fun social life.
good,"Overall Dollar General was a great customer service experience. However, the lack of hours were terrible and unacceptable. I went a whole month and only received four days to work."
good,"Never organized, always different staff, rude employees, its a stressful environment but is close to home. When they have the truck out, its great to have things that you need"
good,Don't get to ahead of yourself. They do favoritism and it's really hard for you to advance unless favoritism. I have begged and pleaded for a full-time position but just won t budge
good,"The company expects too much, for too little pay. Expected to mop floors, stock, constantly on your feet. Expected to be in more places at once than you can be."
good,Dollar General is a good starting job for anyone looking into getting retail and retail management. Great experience to have because you are thrown different aspects that's needed in bigger retail or to further your career. Depending on where you go there are wonderful places to go within to expand your career. But if you get a in a store that's need more work it can be very overbearing and your Dollar General will become your life so balance is key in this place of work.
good,The 2 day I worked at this place we had two imployees assaulted by 4 customers. Also very messy and hours sucked. If they were to drug test everyone there would have failed. Manger was super awesome but never wanted to work when she was needed.
good,Often you are in the store alone as a key holder. Or you and a single cashier. Even when keeping up with the work one cashier just isn't enough sometimes.
good,"Its a typical day at work can be slow depending on the days & whether. It has taught me how to have great customer service, and how to handle money. I love when the days go by fast and its busy. In dollar general it is very mellow and quiet in and outside of the store."
good,had to provide our own uniforms. breaks were a joke. The store was always dusty and dirty. Two many chiefs  and not enough Indians.
good,"A typical day at this company is pretty smooth sail. The job isn't hard but also isn't as easy as it seems. I learned a lot about stocking, counts, and trainee,Also how important greetings are. Management is great sometimes they're overworked but that comes with the position. The hardest part for me was working in a great workplace with such little pay, having to leave and not wanting too. The most enjoyable part is always making the customers happy."
good,DG offers many opportunities with the tools to be successful. But a realistic timeline to achieve is often shortened. You often loss the life balance because the role of store manager is very demanding.
good,"Great for training someone that is fresh into the retail world, the company was pretty new to the California market. That fact made it extremely difficult for me to have a home life because of all the hours I put into my job."
good,"One of the worse jobs I've ever had. They store is dirty no matter what, managers favor certain people, and there is no back stocked protocol. There is no orderly backroom where you can see if there is merchandise in back to help customers."
good,"Somewhat enjoyable. Hard at times, but deadlines always met. Needs better upper management. Rude customers, but that happens anywhere. Fun coworkers that are like family."
good,"Minimum pay, massive workload. I have nothing else to say. This is the end of ""said"" review. Have a nice day."
good,Manager would tell people that they were gonna become this and that but overall wasn't going to give the position to anyone. Very un-organized. Pay was not enough
good,"Some great costumers ,inventory control, store Planograms also the District manger was supportive,some co-works did not company's beast interest in mind ,some where very tardy and it was very hard to stop the vandalism"
good,"A typical day is easy enough:"
good,"I liked the work and the people. Enjoyed my time there, I only left because I was leaving town to attend college, which she knew when she hired me."
good,"I am the only person that works in perishables dept,besides my manager.Its hard to balance all the areas that I work in.Still waiting on help.My manager is partime.I work in dairy,meat,freezer and produce 5 days,sometime go in on my day off to get work done.I work mostly by myself.I ask for help,still waitn months.I love my job.I cannot work all areas of this dept with no help.I work in mornings.My manager in afternoons.Its nonstop at work.I Tuesday and Fridays trucks come.I have to have pallets worked and out dairy,so milk,eggs,dairy items can get in the dairy.Also I have to make sure there's rooms for pallets of produce to fit in.I do the work of 3 people.It feels that way.Through it all I smile and keep good attitude.I operate Manuel,electric pallet jacks.I keep dairy,produce,freezer clean,recovered.I make orders.I take out trash.I make bales.I assist customers.I help my co workers."
good,"I personally lived working at dollar general itself, it was the other employess and the people above me that made the experience rather horrid. They were understanding that i had a small child, but i made up for it."
good,Not a place I would recommend to work at this time. Very bad management. Not the best benefits available and job to life balance was very poor all due to management.
good,I enjoyed the type of work I did there most of  the duties required I was already familiar with. Management at the time was unstable. He was rude to customers and employees alike Highly stressed and pointed his anger at anyone. My co-workers feed on gossip and strife among each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with Management. This was the cause for my leaving.
good,I like to work here but you would think we'd all get more money for as working as hard as we do. The pay is actually forcing me to search for another job.
good,I spent most the day on my feet either taking care of my customers or refacing the self and later at night cleaning the store for the next day. the manager was ok but not for me as i was 7 month pregnant at the time and they expected way to much of me. My co-workers weren't bad but never helped by covering my shift when i was in dire need. the hardest part was being pregnant and trying to keep up with the boys and the best part was the customers.
good,"Typical day at work would be running the cash register, putting away the supply truck, and pulling merchandise forward for better access. I learned how to efficiently ring up merchandise getting customers their service in a timely manner. My co workers were manipulative and created unnecessary situations. The hardest part of the job was trying to progress in the job but being refused equal treatment."
good,"When I took on the position of Store Manager for Dollar General, I expected to be directing, coaching, guiding, & developing associates. This position was NOT any of those things. I barely had time to compile a schedule for the associates due to all the labor that was required in order to remain employed. I tell everyone this was one of my most challenging jobs ever & I have worked in some hard to adjust environments. I believe DG could be more productive and lessen their turnover if they re-evaluated the SM roles and responsibilities."
good,"I worked in a store where the store manager was the training manager in our district. Which meant that he was continuously leaving our store to go help out at other stores, for days or even weeks at a time. Even when he was in our store, he was little to no help to us. I understand the importance of delegation. But he would spend most of his shift in the office, on his phone. Because I was basically running this store by myself I learned a lot about the how dollar general tracks its sales and performance. I could complete any type of paperwork that needed to be done. Including but not limited to EOD, week ending, month ending, performance reviews, vender invoices. I had authority, and was trained to do everything that kept that building running smoothly. Conducting interviews, training new employees, and if need be, filing paperwork against or terminating employees. The only thing I did not have authority to do in that building was terminate the store manager. I was responsible for paperwork, receiving and processing deliveries, planograms, handling large amounts of money, supervising other employees, and maintaining a safe and clean work environment. But most importantly customer service. That was the most enjoyable part of my job as well. Working with the customers on a day to day basis."
good,"management is not professional at all "
good,I dont mind working for dollar general but the staff is so hard to work with meaning that no one wants to stay because of the hours and pay that they recieve
good,I would not work for this company ever again it was bad service and bad management. I was told they train people to be mean and yell at co-workers.
good,It's a good job but I work full-time hours for part- time pay. I love the people I work with. The pay needs a little work. The company needs to come up with a better way to help the people that work for them.
good,"All positions in these store falls on the Store Mgr to work and normally by themselves, No hours to hire employees to help run the store. No benefits package."
good,The pay is not that bad if everyone does their job correctly. If you do not know someone higher up within the company your job is not really secure. I started as an assistant manager and was never offered an opportunity to move higher within the company. I made it very clear I wanted to but was never given the opportunity. things that are out of your control could be the reason for job loss.
good,Enjoyed working with this company once all the kinks got figured out with management. Loved my co-workers would go back!
good,"typical day ,stocking, resetting, recovering, I learn management , team work , work under a lot of pressure ,help my coworker when they need me, always willing to help ,hardest part work double shift , what i enjoyed more interacting whit the costumers making them feel they are home"
good,"I have learned how to be an assistant manager and the basic skills of managing money, time, and associates. The co-workers were friendly and loved to help out our customers."
good,"check out customers all day, make sure shelves are clean and "
good,"This was my first ""real"" job. There is typically only you and a manager there. The customers are not that great, they yell at you for problems with their EBT cards and what not. Management doesn't really care about your problems. The chairs in our break room were plastic cartons. I told the manager I saw a cockroach while sweeping and she said I should expect that, its the dollar store. Pay was minimum, no benefits or discounts. High turn over because it is not a good place to work...at all. I told the manager my check was too low because I worked 30 hours and paid for 15. She said I didn't show up a few days. I had never not come into work and I told her to check the cameras, she said no."
good,I would work shifts that people would call off all the time. If I was unsure of something the manager would yell at me like I was a child asking a question in front of customers. The co-workers always talked behind your back and made it impossible to work together they were always causing trouble. The worst part was when I seen someone stealing items and the manager told me not to worry about it because it wasn't an amount that they would miss. And if I tried to take matters into my own hands I would get fired. I was promised the shifts that I agreed to due to me having small children at home and she never worked me the hours we agreed upon. I did not have a enjoyable part of my job. I wasn't a great place to work for. They treated the customers and the employees very bad and I wanted no part of it.
good,"Although I went into this job thinking it would be good experience I don't think it was worth it and I wouldn't do it again or work here ever again. Although I did learn a lot about the retail work place and I tried to enjoy it, a typical day usually drug on and on because since I was the youngest and newest employee compared to my adult coworkers, the ""leg work"" was usually put on me and even though their were two registers that were both open, my coworker could be up front but still call me from what I was doing in the very back of the store all the way to the front even though by the time I got up there the customer could have been checked out and on their way out the door or gone, In summary, the way management was done and employees worked could have been altered to be more productive instead of everyone relying on me to do all the ""leg work"" and basically run the cash register by myself even though there were two registers that were both always open."
good,"enjoyed the fast pace days working at dollar general, I had many task to keep busy with, enjoyed and respected fellow employees"
good,"Ridiculous expectations and never a pat on the back for a job well done if you didn't get all of it accomplished in the short amount of time you were given. The expectations are high on everyone, so it begins at the district manager level and just trickles down. There isn't enough pay to put up with the BS and the stress that comes with this job, no matter what position you fill."
good,This job required me to do lots of heavy lifting. I felt like I did the job of ten people while other employees were allowed to take many breaks and really did not do their job.
good,"I love my store, team and customers, started to disagree with the direction corporate was taking it, so I decided to retired."
good,The management sucks.  They make promises of promotion only to lie to you and they lie about the pay you will be recieving.
good,"While I appreciated the chance I was given, it almost felt like my services was being abused there, especially for someone who was part-time."
good,"Work was productive for the most part"
good,"It was your normal type of retail job, I didn't really mind it, i would love to work in an office though, I feel better on a computer."
good,Not very flexible always changing things around in the store. Not very good pay. It lacks on store organizational standards.
good,"The best part of my job was the merchandising , the hardest part of the job was being alone in a store because there was no hours to give to other employees,"
good,"i worked here for 10 months and hated it. i accomplished alot here, but this was my first job and i was vary unhappy with the pay."
good,"The store running as a whole, its wonderful. But there are members of the management team who unfortunately do not enjoy it anymore which causes friction between everyone. Honestly a wonderful place to work and shop but some members could use a major tune up in the customer service department as well as keeping the team working together and not trying to divide them."
good,"Typical day included answering incoming calls, explaining the program, asking probing questions to find the right program for each individual client, signing clients up by accepting payment and setting up initial appointment."
good,This is a great company to work for with awesome advancement opportunities. The management however is young and inexperienced. There is no real training and the management staff requires you to do the job of two or three people by yourself within a very short timeframe.
good,There were more managers than regular employees and employees were not present for when they're drawers were counted at night.
good,Like the title says this place is not a fun place to work at the management is so unorganized. This is not a good place to work as a stable job at most maybe it would be a good summer job for teens.
good,"Dollar general is a whole different company now, as compared to when I first started working there. they stated off as family oriented and ended up being more about the dollars."
good,"It was mostly a fast pace environment,I learned how to close which I have never done before,How to count the drawers etc. The Management was not the best but I did respect for them. My co workers were nice and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was not being able to organize things. It was very very unorganized. The customers. They were very nice.I don't believe I had a grumpy customer when I worked there."
good,"it could have been better with maybe a different store manager,and favoritism is something that should never be involved the work place"
good,Manager was insane. Customers were nice and polite. Learned all about retailing and organization of stock rooms. Co-workers were team workers.
good,"A typical day of work consists of me arriving at least 10 minutes before my shift, and immediately being put to work. I would first count my till to ensure that it is $200, and then I start ringing up costumers. I typically work 8 hours so I would stand on my feet for the entire time. When I do not have costumers I straighten up my sections. At the end of the night I count my till down and clean the store before leaving."
good,For the most part i would stock shelves and cashier. Also i would have to make sure the store was zoned every day.
good,it was great working here until I found out some of the management was stealing.
good,I was hired as a Cashier. The manager that hired me left me the first day I started by myself. I had no idea what I was doing. A customer came in for a return I had not been trained on what to do. I had to wait for the manager to call me back because she was playing golf. When this manager left we got another manager who was very condescending. The assistant manager ran the store for two months after the first manager left. There was no guidance from him either. The district manager was crude and rude. It just depends on what store you are working out. A terrible experience at times. Just no real training and treated like you are suppose to know what to do.
good,"Although I did not like the management skills, I was very happy to work here due to the customers. I loved helping them and giving them great service."
good,"This job just was not for me the manager did not help with securing the safety of the managers. I being a small petite female and several of the dollar general stores in our area being robbed in a  short amount of time expressed concern about being in the store alone before daylight and after dark, I was told that was just part of the job."
good,The worst corporate culture that I have ever worked in.  The district and regional managers didn't have a clue what the corporate office was doing or why.
good,I attained great experience with customer service working at Dollar General.
good,I like working for Dollar General but could never keep a good manager.  the location I worked out was always in a mess due to managers doing the part of the job they like but not anything that was challenging.
good,"The job was okay but, nothing spectacular. A typical day at work would be working the cash register and stock in between customers. Management was bossy. There were a few good co-workers. The hardest part of the job was staying after hours. The most enjoyable part was working with good people and customers."
good,"On a average day, there will be a few nice and a few negative customers. With the position I have as a 3rd key holder I continue to learn and grow with my customer service skills. I have learned more over the years to get me where I am now and I want to go further. Management is important to me. I am some what like a manager I don't have the title yet! But in my position as a 3rd key holder I am to assist  the manager when store manager is not present. I supervise my co-workers due to my authority level and they follow my directions and tasks to complete very well. The hardest part of my job is making sure every customer is satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying customers and my ability to put in action my skills and knowledge I have to work with."
good,"Well, I want to start off by saying that this company is an OK company to work IF you have good management. The management I had was not professional and did not do some stuff by the book. I would say be careful and make sure you follow ALL the rules and read your handbook that they have on the website upon the hiring process. IT WILL BE YOUR VITAL TOOL! Especially, with complaints that you may I have."
good,Co-workers are great. Enjoy my customers. Some days are busier than others.
good,"My day was completing my tasks as required and at times tasks of other employees whose work ethics were not of high standards. I found that the company overall had inconsistent management within all levels of operations and being a male was more difficult to advance. Unable to receive an employee handbook on rules, regulations, employee benefits and rights. In consideration of the employees I found high absenteeism of base level employees with favoritism of a selective few jeopardized employee safety."
good,"I worked there for a short amount of time. It was an easy job, but I was told I was hired as a lead sales associate and when I started I was labled as a regular associate without notice. I was also supposed to make a measly $9 an hour but when I received my check I discovered it was minimum wage ($7.25). When I asked the store manager about the situation she said the district manager had no say so and she felt like i didnt have the experience to be the lead (I had 6 years of retail experience at the time with supervisory exp as well). The schedules were absolutely unstructured. I had no idea what time i was supposed to be there until the ""manager"" text me the night before. All to often I was scheduled for 8 hour shifts but as soon as things slowed down i was sent home (sometimes in as little as 2 hours). All in all i believe it is a good company but my particular manager was horrible (she has since been fired)."
good,"Typical day at work. I would get to work, if I was cashiering for the day I would get my register up and running.  I would then check ppl out.  If I was unloading truck and stocking shelves, Then I would arrive at work and start putting product on the shelves ."
good,"Working with customers is the highlight of my day, however the higher management hinders production requirements. Management, district level and higher expect work that should be a workload of a crew of 10 people, the higher management expects us to accomplish the workload with 2 people. Higher management does not understand that if they were to give us more people for our crew, production will rise significantly."
good,"A typical day consisted of cashing out customers, providing merchandise returns, answering phone calls, receiving truck shipments, setting up displays in store, etc. While at Dollar General I learned how to run an entire store smoothly with a very short staff. My co-workers were diligent and for the most part ready to get the job done no matter how large the task. I was able to work under the best management ever and I will be forever grateful for the opportunity. The hardest part of the job was to put out truck delivery items in a timely fashion and recover the store at the same time. In my opinion the most enjoyable part of the job was the completion of the truck deliveries we received every week."
good,"Although I stayed a good number of years,and every other year seemed to have a caring supervisor, the culture was one of fear."
good,"• Manage and run shift, set and meet sales quotas. "
good,"In need of a upper management review, work load is unrealistic, not willing to hire more employees to even work load for others, usually one cashier and one level of management employee for a total of 2 employees furing either 8 hour shift."
good,"The Sales Associate position is a key part-time position and will act as the point of contact for customers. Assist in setting and maintaining plan-o-grams and programs. Stock merchandise adequately. Perform other duties as necessary to maximize profitability, customer satisfaction, and teamwork, while protecting company assets."
good,I don't really have any complaints but I don't have anything good to say either.
good,I loved working with the people at the store the customers were my highlight of everyday.
good,"A typical work place was being a cashier as well as stocking or recovering the store depending on what time of the day it was. The job was very demanding and that required time management skills. The hardest part was that the company did not care about the employees they wanted the job to be done and they didn't care how hot or cold the store was or if there was an inch of water on the floor. The store had to stay open, dollar general on top of that had very high turn over rate and the employees are not very happy."
good,"I didnt like working there. the staff was always so negative never did anything and the store manager gives you the run around about your ""promotion"" I would never work here again!."
good,"This job has been one of the easiest jobs I have ever had. I really like to run register, and work with the public. However out of the whole time I have been here, we have been through two different managers, and also did not have one for a while. Certain co-workers are awesome to work with, but some not so much. I believe the work place is not a place to bring your ""drama"" to, and some do it OFTEN, and for this reason they cannot keep any help."
good,I tried to give my help where it was needed but it wasn't excepted. Customer complaint were daily and tried to fix if I  was allowed.
good,"Was a great company, just to many inconsistences in placement of workers from upper management. No MIT training available."
good,"good job but manager and her side kick would play the ""im your friend today"" game"
good,"Not very employee friendly. I stocked, provided customer service, cashier, invoice log in, and filed. Performed managerial duties when needed. Co-workers was great, loved my job and duties."
good,a typical day at work consisted of being on the cash register and assisting customers shopping. I didn't learn much of anything because i have been in sales / customer service my whole life. The management was nice and so were the co workers.
good,I love working for dollar general i learn how to have patient i like working with people.
good,The hardest part about the was running the register & stocking.
good,I learn something new everyday and I love to because I believe you will not get very far in life with lack of knowledge.
good,"during my nearly 2 years of expierence with dollar general, I learned a lot about customer service. Most customers are polite, but some were just not friendly, over all my customers were the better part of my day. the co-workers are usually pretty easy to get along with other than the constant wanting someone to fill their days. management at my first store was fantastic! she was polite, structured, handled dissatisfied customers politely, and was fair as possible with hours. at the second store, the manager was more of a friend to employees and very unprofessional, in my opinion. the benefits are not great and consume over half of a check if not full time. unless full time, you get no raises. they do cut hours ridiculously a good amount of the year. once or twice a month at the least. its a fairly easy job. the toughest day you'll have is running out of bags or a backed up line of customers."
good,"Stocking, Cleaning , waiting on customers and helping them find what they need."
good,It was ok job I was a cashier and stocker all in one
good,"I loved working here, even through the holidays. Its fun and mostly always busy which is a plus"
good,very clean store . Area where store was located was in a nice area. Store closed at 10pm and 9pm on Sundays. People were very nice
good,"A typical day at work, would be to open or close the store. Some days, I would have to open and close the store. But that would be depending on how many hours for the week, we had on the schedule to work with. I would count the drawers in the mornings to make sure that the correct amount were in each one. Count the petty cash to make sure that it was counted correctly the night before. Set drawers for my cashier that would be coming in to help run the register while, I put up stock in the back of the store. Make sure to have merchandise for my cashier to put stock up while he or she is not busy ringing up or helping customers. Remind my cashier to recover the store as they put up stock to maintain the stores neatness. Assist my cashier when there may be a refund or return and if we get a rush of customers that would take too long for one cashier to ring up everyone. When the cashier has a cash pick up he or she pages me to the front and we each count the money to make sure that we counted the same amount. And all pick-ups and cash taken from the drawers after counted each drawer down goes in a deposit bag. At the end of the day all money and checks are counted and compared to the recorded totals shown on the cashier register tape. On truck day, I would have to make sure that the truck number is the same as on our inventory slip. Double check to make certain that everything that they take off their truck is ours, and that their number amount of merchandise matches with our merchandise number on our inventory slip."
good,"I loved working at dollar general, the manager wasn't professional at all."
good,"Stock the shelves, cashiering and bringing back customers. Working with different kinds of people learning personal things and work related things such as moving items every week and then moving them back. not many hours at the end, loved my job"
good,"A typical day at work would be very stressful, making sure you wouldn't mess up because the manager is VERY striked,"
good,"walk the store to see what needs to be stocked, recover what items I can, stock the shelves"
good,for a stocking day which I loved because I stayed busy and got to see new stuff as it came in
good,Its a ok job i have fun co workers and the enviroment is always good
good,"Our store is very stressful on me, especially since I'm pregnant. It's high shrink and had no heads up. Our store manager is pregnant as well and highly uncoordinated. Our assistant store manager has drama at home and health problems, so alot of the problems fell on the third key manager (myself). Our customers are rude and like to throw objects and are also racist. Freight and stocking was easy, but i can't really life heavy objects, so I was mostly on the register or in the back doing paper work. Overall, I need something less stressful and less off my feet."
good,I didn't mind working at the dollar general because I needed the job but I would like something to where there are some benifits and long term employment.
good,"How to run the cash register, stocking, helping custmers, cleaning and counting money"
good,Not something I would really reccomend anyone to go work for the upper management seem to not care about the staff
good,"As Assistant Manager, a typical day was non-stop. Running the store consisted of logging in vendors, working cash register, making schedules, inventory, receiving product and putting it out on shelves, product resets, cash deposits, and daily paperwork. Finding dependable, hard workers was a challenge."
good,"Helping customers find what the need, not very challenging though."
good,It's always busy. From returns to cashing the it customers and running around the store working. However I enjoy the stocking and hard labor. It's makes the time go by fast
good,I opened and closed the store. I enjoyed seeing my favorite customers come in the store!!  But they were also very rude people that came in too!! You do have to work day and night shifts and also weekends.
good,"Its who you know, and not about you. Overall the company doesn't care. Your just a number. That's why it has such turn overs. They don't really care about you or your needs as a great employee"
good,"The training could be a lot better. You can work there for months and still be learning because you just get thrown out. You get ""trained"" but not really. They show you main things then you learn the rest on the job which this can be frustrating for everyone."
good,They dont care about there employees.  It's about what they get out of you.they are not a fair company and they will lie to get what they need.there pay scall is messed up to.
good,Working there was ok but then a new manager came in and fired me and no one has told me why. Other than that it's not a bad place. Employees that deserve a more than minimum wage should be paid more.
good,No stability with weekly hours . Mandatory part time workers have difficulty in raising a family. Promotion promises are not kept. Too much drama.  Problems brought in to store
good,It’s a okay job you have to be very fast open minded have to pay attention work with people all the time stock shelves and unload the truck that comes in and clean up sometimes
good,"For the work involved the pay is lacking ,it is physical work on subpar work surfaces. Pushing heavy freight into stores and the store managers are mostly rude. They hesitate to work with the driver and it eats the clock up for the drivers and have sat for hours due to poor scheduling. Bosses say it is about the store not the driver? They say salary is 80,000 to 85,000 but then tell you they keep drivers at 70,000"
good,I was suppose to be trained but instead just threw me into the game and hoped id figure everything out myself. I fwlt lost most of the time honestly. I did enjoy having conversations with the customer s
good,I was there alone for three hours on my FIRST day. It was a catastrophe. I had no idea where anything was and barely knew how to use the old cash register
good,"work most time by myself"
good,"The company is an okay starter for a job. Dont work to many hours and minimum wage. But when you actually want to work, most of the time they wont let you because you cant have more than 24 hours a week. So if you want a 40 hour week, find another job with it."
good,The company is fast growing which creates a lot of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate.  There is continuous development for the store managers.  Company is behind the ball on embracing differences and diversity.
good,I met a lot of great people that I am still friends with today. The hours were flexible. Not the most friendly customers but there were a lot of great ones as well.
good,"DG could be a better place to work; if they would give more respect to their employees.  If the DMs showed up in the stores more frequently and assisted the store with more “hands on” visits.  The DMs need to learn to be more appreciative of the Store Managers and all that they do!  The stores need more employees working a shift, in order to get better Customer satisfaction!"
good,"Days are very busy and go by fast there is always something to do."
good,Cut my hours drastically is the reason why I left but if you dont need the hours that bad it would be a good job for a college student or high school student
good,the old boss was very rude and didn't really know how to  be a boss at all. the  store was always a  complete mess and stuff was not  placed correctly in the store.
good,"I work hard for what I do, but I don’t get paid for the things I have done. Employees would put everything on me and wouldn’t try to help. I am very quick and have a steady pace, if other employees couldn’t get the job done, they expect me to do it."
good,"Dollar General is driven by motivation to satisfy their customers. This company always challenged my work ethic constantly. With customers constantly coming and going, stock decreasing regularly, and staying alert for theft crimes in the store, things can become a lot more complicated quickly."
good,"This is a job I would definitely recommend for teenagers just turning 18. It provides skills such as money management, organizing, and customer service. I would not make it into a career personally unless you go into management."
good,"I did not enjoy working for this company. The store was to big to properly run it, stock it, and serve customers too. The only good thing was that the manager was very considerit with managing the store."
good,"My day at work starts with getting a cash drawer ready and cashing out customers. If the truck was there going totes or containers and waiting on customers. Towards the end of the night sweep and mop the store,but not all the time do u get your work finished because of hours being cut,cashiers quit ing last minute,schedule changes."
good,"This company will for sure get you trained in the retail line if things, it does offer advancements. However the work to life ratio always felt like wasn’t important. Wound recommend management positions to not have young children."
good,I love working there  and everything but the management is way to personal and doesn't know how to separate work from their own personal life and end up making us not want to be there and the pay is garbage.
good,"Poor management,  dont care about their employers,  very low salary for how hard they make you work. Never have the same schedule. 15 cent raises a year..."
good,"Luckily, I had a very great boss who took care of me and my other coworkers, however in some stores, management and employees are rude and a complete joke. Good bosses weren't recognized enough!"
good,I absolutely loved and hated my job at dollar general. Hated it because there was never a set schedule never enough people to work. Loved it because you meet alot of great customers.
good,At first I thought I was working with a great bunch of people. But as time went on I began to notice that members of management either didn't care and didn't want to do what was needed and that prevented me from doing some of my job responsibilities.
good,Didn’t get paid for being off the clock but you had to be off the clock to close the register and the store but you had to stay over 2 hours to stock mop and clean for the person in the morning or they fire you well I did that every day for 3 months never got paid for the additional 2 to 3 hours they pretty much made me work off the clock or we couldn’t go home
good,not a ad place to work for but the manager didnt take things seriously and hired kids who didnt do their jobs correctly or at all and made it difficult to perform job duties that were required
good,"Things just didn't go the way they should, they only care about you as an employee not a person. I just really got tired of the way they treat their workers, I personally would never go back and would never ever refer someone to them for employment."
good,"It is a good job, but personally I don't get benefits for being a part time cashier. The customers are really sweet and love getting to know the staff, growing and evoling with they everyday, it really is a good time."
good,I worked my butt off for very little reward did not move up worked 14 days straight with barley hitting 40hrs that way I wasn't on overtime no overtime aloud
good,"They are ok to work for. They just expect you to put it first and your familu on the back burner. Open to close shifts, working by yourself 2 to 3 days a week."
good,"I Currently Work At Dollar General The Work Environment Is Fast Past And Fun Most Of The Time . For As Many Hours I Work And The Responsibilities As A Lead Sales Associate The Pay Is Not Good Enough . We Get Paid Weekly , Get No Discounts . If The Pay Was Better And We Get Discounts I Would Recommend To Work At Dollar General"
good,I'll just say started out great then a new manager came in and now I feel it's time for a change.Its better to keep my self respect than be kicked around every time I go in
good,"while the work its self is simple and not to demanding where Dollar General falls short is Management.in both locations the Managment was either A) too demanding or B) too lazy, there was no in between."
good,Managers thought they were better then employees. No advancement enless you were buddy buddy with them. Employee culture is that you can be replaced with out second thought.
good,"My experience working with Dollar General was alright, it might have been better if it was somewhere else. The small town I was living in was honestly a little whack, however.. It had an ok atmosphere for the most part, co-workers and customers were alright as well."
good,"Dollar General was a good first job experience. I learned a lot of things like basic Sales Associate criteria. I mainly focused on cashiering, but also was able to do restocking/ recover and face the store. Along with cleaning the bathrooms and store. It was a really stressful workplace environment."
good,"I liked working for them. Stayed busy and always had things to do. Down fall never had enough employees, when I worked for them. So always had alot to do."
good,Dollar General is a ok place to work but you dont get paid enough for what you are required to do depending on the staff you wont get the hours you want to work either
good,Working for Dollar General wasn't all terrible. The pay could be better.  I always received my full 30 min break. The manager at the time was very for themselves which made things difficult.
good,I want to be some where with a steady pace and get paid enough to provide better for my family.  The opportunity to meet new people and learn about new things.
good,The work is not hard it’s just the fact of When you do the work and go beyond you don’t get credit for it and I always Worked at different stores from Trussville to center point parkway to Pinson and my own store but other than that nahh don’t do it
good,Things were consistently changing and it was always more on things getting worse than getting better. Lost a lot of good workers on my team for being accused of theft when your able to see that the customers in the area would take what they wanted and leave. No security for my staffs safety.
good,Over all was a learning experience every job isnt cut out for everyone but pay was decent and over all enjoying the position as far as my customers. 😊 if you enjoy working with people and seeing people from all over i recommend you try it and see how you like it.
good,"The job isn't too hard until you get into management. A very part time company, hard to get hours. It is easy to move up within the store but the district managers do not want you to exceed past store manager."
good,"Typical day at work was stressful,  if you had a problem with the register the managers would come up and sigh like I would know how to do it when only the manager can do what the register was trying to do. I learned to over look the bad comments point towards me from the managers an walk away. The hardest part of the job wasnt really nothing to do with actually working it was mostly the managers."
good,Management isn’t the way it should be. They pick favorites and lack communication. And they flip the “rules or policies” on you a lot. Hours are constantly being cut each week causing employees to lose hours weekly. A lot of good employees leave because they treated unfairly rather then the poor employees being treated that way. That is why I am leaving. I work really hard for the company for over an year. They don’t value your work or opinions or you as an employees
good,"When I was working here it sucked. It was no supervisor, the managers enjoyed conflict with each other and trying to make everybody pick sides. Nobody liked going on the register at all, everybody would want to just stock only. The customers are pretty cool but need to understand that the cashier can’t leave the register and shop for them. It’s very easy and you still have the day to yourself"
good,"Management was okay, but store politics was bull. I was a great employee till they hired someone to manage the store that has NVR worked in a dollar store and now I've lost my job bc she didn't like me. I even told the district manager about it but it never mattered. I wasn't the only one who saw all of this was happening either. They made me think I was part of the team, and would be able to move up if I put in the work, then one day I went to work just to be fired and haven't heard a word since, that's how much they really cared!!!"
good,"You really have to be a jack of all trades to work at DG. Employees dont show up for work and you would now have to multitask 3 different departments all in an 8hr or less shift. Then YOU get blamed for not completing all tasks. Management lacks in communication and hands on store productivity. Manager at the time, sat in the office eating food all day, watching the camera. Too many lazy employees"
good,Poor management. Lack of organization. Zero benefits. But loved the customers and the job.  The hours we're not consistent. No compassion from the Corp on family emergency. I have a son and I didn't get time off on holidays to spend with my family while others with no children or family in the area got to have time off. I asked for days when I applied for the job and we're promised the day shift but didn't last long.
good,"It was a  great environment, customer friendly. I loved working with my co workers, but the management staff was poor. Also, the amount of work hours given were very limited and poor. Managing the hours were based off favoritism."
good,It Was A Fun Job Experience For 6 Months It Was Great Until i Got My New Manage That Was Racist . She Called Me Name That I Shouldn’t Have Been Called . But I Put In My Two Weeks And Found A Better Job . No One Should Be Treated Like That No Matter The Circumstances .
good,Dealing with some customers in a rural setting can be challenging. Especially in a recreational area where some customers may have imbibed just a wee bit too much.
good,"Regardless of her many Awards from the company, the manager there ran her store like a high school melodrama. Customers and Personnel were all treated differently according to their moodiness leaving no chance for consistency in service."
good,I felt like they where using me I was doing way to much for the amount of money I was making the worker's where making the work environment non workable
good,"I didn't enjoy working at Dollar General. Their expectations tend to be to much. For example, for most of my time there, I was working alone. This included stocking shelves, bringing in the truck, working as cashier and meeting any other tasks needed but yet they expect you to be within the first 30 feet of the register. That's hard to do if your tasks involve being in the back of the store. Their pay is poor for what they expect. There is no employee appreciation within the company other than a measly 20% discount on Dollar General brand only items. The registers are constantly braking down etc."
good,I know its a good company to work for but with all jobs if the management is poor the staff will not put there best foot forward. with that being said it was hard for me to get the staff i needed
good,"Fast pace, demanding and challenging. Great opportunity to learn and build on skills. Great advancement opportunities. Great place to work and build customer skills"
good,But when you management that think they can't treat you poorly and not recognize any effort your putting in even though it's making them look good and upgradeing their store it's time to go I can't stay poor management every employee should get some kind of reconition
good,The management is awful but the work environment was good. I switched stores and it got worse and they lied and would not give me unemployment  so I really wouldn’t tell people to  go work here
good,"Dollar General isn't the best job to have.They expect you to do twice as much work as your scheduled for, then want to give out disciplinary write ups if you don't get things finished. Or promise people advancement then give the position to someone that hardly has any experience in the company. This is why I no longer work at Dollar General."
good,"Busy/Slow"
good,Poor management and and extremely underpaid. The company is not family oriented and the actual store manager had no respect for the employees or customers.
good,Management was good but had some things I would change. I feel they should plan out the schedules better to make sure the more important things got done on time
good,They job is ok if you’re in high school and you need a part time job but other than that it’s not something you can live off of if you want to succeed
good,"Daily duties included opening the store. Doing daily reports, making the schedule. Making sure all the seasonal was put out and set to the mag, Doing PIA's, running the store alone for a minimum of 5 hours alone due to lack of store hours. Checking out customers and vendors and putting away freight during the time I was there alone."
good,There were favorites among the manager she didn’t fire me she simply just stopped calling me in for work which I found very unprofessional. The only upside we’re the customers and it was easy to work the Register
good,"Management and not enough hour for employees to get the work done or needed to make the store perfect. Need to give the stores more hours, so merchandise can be put up instead of piling up in the stock room."
good,"Dollar general is hardly even a part time job. One store might get 170 hours to split between 6 people. Many days the junior members are expected to work irregular shifts and might only accumulate 9-12 hours a week. Minimum wage. When hours get cut the least liked employee gets their hours cut until they only work one day per week, effectively forcing them to quit."
good,overall a good place to work when managed properly I quit due to a negative district manager Some of the stores however need more employees then the store is willing to pay for
good,"Not a bad place for a 1st time Manager, but just a high priced, relative, stock person.  Mandatory 6 day weeks, 2 closings, 2 6am.  The let the facilities go until they are threatened by code enforcement.  Pay is horrible.  Not a wonderful place to work."
good,"Upper Management is Poor, Lack of Communication with All Associates, but it’s your choice, if you choose to work for them, it’s a great Part time job, but not to make a living on unless your in Management making Salary."
good,Opening is much better than closing. You are only given one 30 minute break. Shifts are almost always short staffed and equipment is not the best.Great for first time job seekers and college students.
good,"it was all in all a good learning experience and pay, but there was also drama and they would over work gullible kind new workers. you would be called in last minute occasionally but scolded if you had an emergency come up."
good,"Cost of living for adults is more then for kids in high school. Working here is stressfull in many ways such as drama from other workers , customers ."
good,Company need to spend money in payroll hours. To be really number one take time and people then money to be successful need to really listen to the associate we work it we know it. Invest in current store and not build anymore for now. Have to perfect the one you have now.
good,Things that I learn at Dollar general was how to open and close a store. How to read the diagrams to set the new lay outs. Running the store without management around.
good,"I can say that my recent 7 years of working at k-mart actually prepared me to work for this job, it was very new to others stocking, merchandizing, and setting shelves and layouts from the ground up until the day came and the manager was absolute nut case."
good,"You are expected as a sales associate to do most of the same things as supervisors, just without the pay raise and without the key. Managers are hard to get ahold of if they are there at all, and most supervisors have a superiority complex."
good,"Dollar General lost its focus some time between 2008 and 2018.  When I first started, their primary customer focus was catered to working females strapped for cash between the ages of 25 to 85.  They didn't sell cigarettes or alcohol.  When I left, Dollar General had been selling cigarettes at the impulse rack where children buy candy and soda for at least 5 years.  The manufacturing and selling of tobacco products is nothing short of chemical warfare against families for profit.  Cigarettes are the most toxic and addictive substance you can buy over the counter.  What little money a family might save by shopping at Dollar General will be spent on medical bills and loss productivity at their work place.  There is no better way to condition the next generation to smoke than through the observation of their parents purchasing cigarettes at the impulse rack where they buy candy.  I was disgusted by the hypocrisy, and left."
good,it was different good at first but then atmosphere went down the hill. there wasnt enough staff so always having to cover others shifts till you could find someone
good,"I love my job just my manager won't give me the hours and my pay is too low for what they expect us to do."
good,This job opened alot of other job opportunities but the downfall was the employees and management was not a team effort and therefore was a result of many problems.
good,It was a job that I enjoyed because some of the customers and coworkers made it fun.  The atmosphere was friendly and you stayed business and on your feet.
good,"High theft area and I experienced racism. Took two months for background check to clear, even if you have no record. Lack of morale and employees were rude and demeaning."
good,Honestly I don't have an opinion to post about Dollar General it was just an ok job! I had my ups and downs and I learn how to work under constant pressure.
good,"I left after having significant issues y own manager and upper management. Corporate never gave my store the tools to fix it up and never really listened to anything you said unless they liked you. The Company also doesn't keep track of required hours of each store manager. My manager would miss work, leave early, and cause other problems in the store. Usually working less hours than my co-workers or me when they need at least 45. You can only do so much when everyone above your position doesnt care."
good,Complications with the new manager forced me to no longer be there and they need to keep up on the developement of their managers and district managers
good,Had no training from the GM. I was giving keys in a week and told to manage the store. There was only 2 employees in a very busy store. I work every night and weekend as well.
good,"As Manager, the hours required are extensive. Manning hours given to store are low. Too much to do and not enough time to do it all. Great pay, good district manager."
good,Great store manager but upper management was never around to listen about employees concerns.  No advancements.  Back stock room a mess could not even walk boxes and boxes of stock everywhere.  Not enough staff to keep up with stocking the shelves.
good,"When I worked at poolville dollar general, I would always get called in on my days off every time, they were always understaffed, the whole store was always cluttered, and hardly shelved"
good,"I found out early that i actually enjoy the management position i was given and loved to serve my customers. However Dollar General as a whole has a system that does. not. work. Only 2 people on staff at any point and time and often cutting ours to save on payroll when an entirely different store from the one i worked at went over on payroll, we were punished for someone else mistakes and then also punished because we didnt meet stocking deadlines by the district and regional managers. To put this in perspective i still had the best looking store in the district. Often i would be left to work alone at night when thier policies strictly say otherwise. The company refuses to hire within it seems and there is no room for raises, when i persued one after doing really well on inventory for the year, i was told it would eat into payroll and was refused. There is no room for promotion either as they dont fire anyone they just pressure them into leaving, and few do because the structure of the company seems to promote laziness."
good,I had a WONDERFUL store manager but my district manager was awful. I cant really give a good say because both of them left the company after I did I don't know what it is like now.
good,Little or no support to the store level from DM or home office concerning grounds keeping or staffing. staffing hours greatly under rated at busy seasons.
good,I liked working at this place of business but there wasn’t good security at all it was unsafe. Overall the business was a learning experience to gain.
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar Store. I had high hopes for that place. I would love to go back there and work again until I become the new store manager.
good,They don’t pay enough to pay my bills most of the workers act like they are doing stuff but there really not two managers will sit there and talk with a customer about personal things for hours if they happen to know them
good,not enough pay for the extensive amount of work. Crazy micromanagement. However this is a good temporary job if your up for the hours. No set time as to when you get off
good,Managers Worked too many hours alone in the stores and were6expected to accomplish too much. Had to work additional hours to make up short scheduling to the extent of 70 to 100 hours a week at holidays
good,"I provide management services but recieve sales associate pay. Dutie are beyond belief for my job title and there's no communicating with management. Management needs to experience a typical day and night of work at Dollar General. Store is constantly hiring or needing help. This place is a mess, a stressful mess."
good,Great for a side job to earn extra money. The store has the best products and prices making it affordable for everyone. Convenient store hours and location.
good,This was a great job to pick up when finding work was difficult. Back during the economic recession jobs were hard to come by and Dollar General was more than happy to accept employees
good,"From the very beginning, working here has stressed me out. Barely any training at all. Promoted to keyholder before even being hired and again, not trained at all. Company does not provide enough labor hours to train properly then will absolutely write you up if you do something wrong. (This is not the fault of our manager, just company policy). Employees chosen love to not show up to work and I am often called in to work other's shifts, but when a home life situation arose and I needed to work days, my hours were cut. ZERO balance for home vs. family. Feeling like I'm always on call. "
good,Pay/hours can range. Can be really bad at some stores and really good at other stores. Just depends on what location you are going to work for. But all together a good company to work for.
good,"While working there, no matter how many times i would say something to them, it felt like they hardly ever listened to me. There was hardly ever any kind of leeway when it came down to more important things rather than work. Whether it was family issues that needed to be resolved, moving purposes, anything, it was like no one even cared."
good,The job at dollar general was for someone that was going to college with no family or responsibilities. The pay was not something that you could make a decent living.
good,I only worked at dollar general as a part time key holder while I was working for LabCorp. it was just to put a little extra money in my pocket. the store I was located at could never keep employees and could never stay stocked because people were to lazy.
good,"I wouldn't go back to working for Dollar General again, the corporate managers are arrogant, they don't have compassion for the people working for them. However I do have to say the store manager I had made working there a little more bearable."
good,Not enough pay lack of advancement But a relaxed work environment. My manager was highly overworked and  not given the leniency to get employees more Hours which cause stress
good,The scheduling by my supervisor caused may restless nights . People would have to close the store and not be out of there until almost midnight. Then be back in the next morning at 6am. Poor scheduling.
good,"It was my off day, the manager called me and said that I was suppose to come in but my schedule said I was off. I politely told her that my schedule said I was off and she had a attitude and told me to not come in because I was fired."
good,"I didnt mind working at dollar general, at times it got busy but mostly it was laid back. I got along well with my coworkers for the most part.i preffered to run the register instead of stocking"
good,It’s a great place for college students that need some cash in their pockets. Wouldn’t recommend it for people with high experience living. Dollar General
good,"I think that they should pay employees more than they do for the amount of work expected out of them. "
good,"Not a hard job but the employee turnover rate is high meaning expect to get called in a lot and never expect a consistent schedule. Work is solid and pay is solid but if you have a second job or school, the scheduling can make things difficult."
good,"I would recover the store, take care of checking in and vendors, would assist the customers with issues, took care of ashier issues, would do resets in the store,stocked shelves, and ran the register when the cashier had a line of 3 or more people.I learned about planograms, resets in seasonal areas, and scan store for inventory counts. Most of the management I worked under were great and taught me a lot of things that I needed to know how to do like damage out items, what to do with certain paperwork and how to check in trucks and vendors. I feel the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers that did not want to understand you are doing you job according to the policy set by Dollar General. I enjoyed helping customers, doing resets and keeping the store neat and presentable for customers"
good,"Extremely monotonous. Little room for advancement, and almost no chance of going full time sue to lack of available hours."
good,work was not hard . dont make very much money and it was hard get many hours to be able to suport yourself. very friendl store was always clean and customers seemed always happy
good,"Overall in the experience of working there, I was saddled with a position that I wasn't compensated for and probably under qualified until learning the requirements of what I was to do. There was a lot of expectations in others that weren't being met while they management did little or nothing to help fix those problems. It wasn't a difficult job but would become stressful when the work was saddled on only a few people. There was little regard for the rules when it came to regulating them or at least maintaining them on equal grounds for all employees, and a lot of grounds for people to be unprofessional about work place relations and position."
good,"In dire need of a over haul in management at my previous store location. Manager is salary, I get it, But does NOT mean management has any right to treat people/or co-workers poorly."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Dollar General I worked at, but that was because I enjoyed dealing with the public and liked who I worked with.  We underwent a change of management; the new District Manager let go of the previous staff to hire a new crew.  I have filled in at other DGs before and the enviroment was much worse.  The company is LOATHE to give overtime and chronically understaffs the stores.  "
good,"Everyone worked really hard at their job. Greeted customers as they came in the store. I worked the cash register, stocked shelves and cleaned for some shifts.The hardest part of the job was when I worked truck night."
good,Laid  back days. Busy at times. Management was so so. Stocking was hard.  Most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers were happy when they left the store.
good,"While working at Dollar General, when I first started working the hours were fair and good because i was hired during holiday season. I was working 30+ more hours up until the holiday season was over and then my hours fell down to 13-20 hours. Management for the most part at my store was horrible , it was so unorganized and there was no order. I did learn alot more about operating a register. I really only enjoyed the weekly pay, working side by side with my coworkers and making my customers day when they came into my job."
good,I think this job itself is ok but the direct leadership is very poor and the company seems to not have a steady approach to the day to day operations of the stores.
good,"Work long hours. Management is all about themselves, forgetting its the little person who gave them their positions. They will put you down then offer you a promotion."
good,This company doesn't really look out for its employees and they are very greedy when it comes to the pay for the work that they are wanting you to complete.
good,The company has way to high of standards for getting truck done. You have 2 employees and 1 has a set amount of freight to put out while being the only one on the register. The stores are usually dirty and a lot of the managers go on power trips
good,"It was a extensive job,  very hot in the building,  especially the warmer months,  but they provided free water to stay dehydrated. We worked fast pace and long hours but the pay was ok."
good,Overall it’s not that bad as long as you move quickly and efficiently and wear supportive shoes you will be fine and make sure that you keep all of your purchases labeled
good,In the right situation it would not be bad.  There is never enough help scheduled. I thought they would have more people scheduled to have products shelved and have those shelves straightened.  It did not give the store a good appearance. The training on the store layout and plan-o-grams could be sooner and better. It would give the associate a better  idea when placing returns to the shelf. I worked for three different managers who all did breaks and lunches differently. I.t seemed cliquey
good,It's a great place to work but the manager doesn't do her job right and use lead and assistant managers were doing it. And it could be a little cleaner and have the product on the floor.
good,"I worked for Dollar General for avery short time, it was the worst. The district manager ignores you and takes days to respond to your request to speak with him on possability of transfering"
good,"I did not get enough hours like i asked for, if you ask for time off in two weeks they won't write it down and you will have to work those days anyway."
good,"While I first started working there it was fun, until now management changed. They were horrible and even if you asked 2 weeks in advance was still ask thousands of questions why you needed off."
good,Feel as though you can be promoted only to ASM. The staff turnover is great because company does not seem to care much about loyalty. Think they would rather not have long term employees because of the raises they have been given. Cheaper to hire new people at minimum wage.
good,"Overall experience was ok working for Dollar General. There were some good times, bad times, and worse times. The worst part about working for the company was the location of the store."
good,"Employees are open and kind. Area is very fast-paced and never dull. Constant customers keeps the time moving fast. I've learned how to handle customers effectively. Management is open to suggestions of how to better the workplace. Normally understaffed to the point that only the minimum can be achieved. Hardest part of the job is really the amount of work expected, and the time given. Work life to regular life balance is uneven. Must be available for call-ins any day, including most days off."
good,I ran the store when the manager was absent. I stocked shelves and restock. I worked the register helped customers. I help clean the store. I trained new employees. The hardest job was to report when things were going on at the store and yet had to give up my job because no one wanted to believe you. Was my best job ever. Being a Manager was my next step.
good,"The job is fun, busy and consistent. The customers are amazing. The upper management is very rude, lazy and not willing to do their job properly. would definitely suggest changes in upper management"
good,"not at all what it was supposed to be .was told I would be working 4 -10 hour shifts.they work five -11 1/2 hr shifts most weeks.most of people are friendly, very strict absence policy, and production policy"
good,"I went into a management position while working for the company, but the compensation for the amount of work required for a manager was not worth it. I worked in a high theft store, and it was unpleasant to be there. My boss was awful, really, really, awful."
good,"working for the company at first was fun and exciting until moving in to the store manager position not enough support from district managers to up keep stores and solve problems the best part is the customer but the lack of work life balance is unsatisfactory along with the job security . a typical day requires to open store delegate task for employees manage process ,payroll ,inventory and general up keep of the store .monitor  and check in vendors as well . making sure deposits get to bank in a timely manner as well as having adequate change"
good,"When I started out here, it was enjoyable and fun. After a while though it was just loads of stress and I just couldn't take it anymore from my manager."
good,"Dollar General is a multi billion dollar company with over 6,000 locations. It's a very easy job if you need to pay a quick bill. But the environment is very poor. Occasional robberies, a lot of customer dissatisfaction, and under average management."
good,"This is  a physically demanding job but can be fun if you have a motivated team by your side. i have found typically no more then 3 employees will be on the same shift at a time, and with the amount of suggested production the company would like from you...you could stand to have at least 4 employees on at all times."
good,This job works for some people but not me. I worked her for a few months before I had to move and the manager was great. this just wasn't the job for me.
good,Very stressful environment. You get one off day a week. You have to work 48 plus hours a week. The management is always changing. People tend to not work with this company long.
good,"Is a very stressful place to work. No chance of moving up ,no chance of making more money.I have tried. Management refuses. Store manager is always leaving work early.other employee's are rude, slack in their work, some are always calling off or leaving early.  When there is an issue where manager needs to be contacted, she never answers her calls or even calls back, leaving other employee's to figure it out. Management is rude and acts like it's a burden to her life to work. Other employee's stand around doing nearly nothing as others work their tail off."
good,need a better communication from upper management has a work plan but dose not have coverage that is needed
good,It is a very high paced place to work. You have to be able to multi-task and also be able to work under stress. When working the register you have to have a pleasant interaction with the customers and always willing to help them and to see that they are happy with their visit so they will come back and support your business.
good,"Working at dollar general was great for customer relations. The customers made the job worthwhile. Management, higher than myself, wasn't however as friendly."
good,"Dollar General is a very stressful place to work at with very challenging customers. But, it is worth the work. This job teaches you responsibility and good customer skills."
good,"I went through a lot of management changes, which is what made me decide to leave. One of the managers they hired were terrible, and no one would do anything about it. Other than that, it isn't too bad as long as the team is good (i was fortunate to have a pretty good team), it's decent for anyone looking for easy work."
good,"Dollar general was a decent place to work.  My coworkers there were friendly and helpful.  The downside to working there was the pay.  And, to my knowledge, it hasn't improved much."
good,The communication was terrible. I went on break for college for about a month and they never told me they rehired my position even though they said I would have it. Pay and hours are very low and management was very rude.
good,"Each day you report to work it's going to be challenging due to the location I worked at was very busy. Customers are always in and out along with your vendors. I learned a lot with working at Dollar General, one learned to deal with so many different personalities in a days time. Hardest part of the job is dealing with shoplifters, and customers that want to bother other customer by asking for money and different things like that. Although I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to know I was doing something at times to help others as well."
good,I absolutely enjoyed my time at Dollar General Market stores. The management staff was inconsistent and there was a definite lack of promotional opportunity.
good,"Dollar General was ok to work for. We had accurate time to get our mini tasks done on the computer. We were rushed at times  to get merchandise out on the floor, but that was due to customer assistance (not a bad thing).  "
good,"A typical day at work at Dollar General would consist of taking care of paperwork and other employees needs and requests. I then would set or change planograms for product to be placed on them. Stocking is a priority and takes place every day. Unloading the truck on truck day and making sure myself and my team got the merchandise unboxed and placed neatly in its home location in a timely and efficient manner. After the day would end, I would put together the deposit and handle all the money and end of day paperwork before the next day."
good,"It was a good job to begin with but as it progressed, some managers liked to take advanatage of you and put more on you than what an average person could handle."
good,My manager was rude at times. I feel like the company has unachievable goals for the common worker when it came to stocking. Many of the roll containers we received were not in good shape hard to push around. Many of the truck drivers we got were very rude.
good,They expect you to work yourself silly for minimum wage. Hire you for part time hours and schedule you for full time. Revolving door of employees no one wants to work for the wages. I spent 8 years there and only got up to 8.00 an hour raises are minimal.
good,It was a good working environment for the most part. Coworkers were great and greeting customers was easy. Was able to work on my own at times and it made the day very productive.
good,"There is not enough staff or hours for the workload that is expected at the store."
good,the store was  under poor management.Sometimes we didnt get breaks and lunch was maybe 15 minutes. The store often had one employee in it. Work load was big and pay was not near enough.
good,I’ve had at lot of trouble with one of the stores I worked at. Including getting  sexually harassed by the store manager. When I helped set up and transferred to the new store things turned around 10 fold.
good,In my employment with Dollar General I was very displeased. The company in itself is fantastic. Professional management at the regional level as well as almost perfect workflow. However there were many faults at the location I was employed. Management was very slow to reacting to issues and complaints made by both customers and employees. No advanment whatsoever. If at another location I am positive it would be a pleasant experience and career.
good,"Dg will overwork you for low pay, the president of the company was coming and i worked over 30 hours in a few days. No thank you, no sorry we couldn't give you a break monday, sorry you had two breakdowns. No appreciation. They dont care about you."
good,I wouldn’t recommend dollar general to anyone only if it’s just a job to start off with until you get a better paying job. They want you to stay busy even if it’s nothing to do. You basically come in everyday that you work and do that over and over
good,"Competitive, good job for a student or a retired person. There is no future in this job. The manager shows to much favoritism and no set schedule. Customers were always complaining. I enjoyed working there, but only for the customers. Bathrooms always needed work. Backroom was messy."
good,Sad to say I had been wrongfully fired and accused of stealing 20 dollars  and lied to about what had really happened. Which i find highly unfair and if your innocent you should be able to keep your job
good,"A typical day would be dealing with customers, stocking, cleaning etc. I used to love me job entirely until I started to see how the company doesn't really care about their employees and I had gotten a manger who doesn't know what they are doing and nobody seems to care. The best part of the job is the customers, always has been and always will be. They are what makes it all worth it."
good,It was ok but very stressful. It was an extremely small store. Not enough room for product. The district manager basically ignored the store. The store manager worked hard for years but has about given up. The company will not do anything to help this small town store.
good,i liked dolalr general just not my district. the job was face paced and fun but they did not agree with you being sick if there was no one to cover your shift.
good,"As cashier you are given tasks to do in isles and expected to complete all tasks while being the only one to maintain the register. As key carrier you are given many tasks to complete and if anyone calls in sick you need to show up to cover. Recovery, Gobacks, Mopping, Sweeping,Money counting, Sale stickers every week, Returns, Coupons, and Checking in new item deliveries."
good,"It was a good place to work, just not enough communication between managers and other sales associates. Was very chaotic.I learned how the process is done to do all the planograms, unloading the truck, and so on."
good,Never have good raises. If someone called in my manager would have me work 12-14 hr shifts. My manager went on surgery leave for 6 months and I was left to run the store on $8 a hr.
good,I liked working there but bad hours and no advancement. Getting paid weekly was pretty good though. A few managers are ok the others not so great. % Minute smoke breaks every two hours and if you work long shift 30 minute break. Customers can get on your nerves and recovering is a pain in the rear.
good,First job easy enough. Strict on how things are done and appearance was a huge deal to the regional manager. Store has improved since my employment. short staffed
good,"No set work schedule"
good,"I am a hard worker and was able to fulfil twice, if not more, of what was required from a good worker. I asked for a raise and some vacation hours after 1.5 years with the company and it was denied"
good,"I have been cussed out more times working there than anything "
good,"Repetitive workload, lots of customer interaction, tasked with  maintaining a clean store. "
good,Majority of the time you are standing on your feet when you are not attending to the customers you are stocking shelves. the hours vary as well as the days you worked.
good,"Manager was Rude and negative all the time. Was yelled at infront of paying customers, Told I was slow and incompatant. Worst place to be at that is why i quit."
good,"Dollar General is a fast-paced and stressful work evironment. They only have 2 people on shift, which puts a strain on workload for the people there. The manager has little sympathy if that work isn't done, and they don't give cashiers enough hours."
good,constant movement lots of work very little pay. advancement can be quick but advance wrong people at times. no bennifits given. depending on the store your in can be very stressful and drama filled.
good,"Hard company to work for. Employees are typically over worked and do single shift coverage to meet the payroll guidelines. most stores are dirty, unorganized, the ordering system is a joke. Cant get the outs in and ship stuff you don't need."
good,it was fun at first but then things went down hill fast. A typical day at worked included mostly hatefulness and bulling from the district manager. the hardest part of the job was not quitting due to the district manager.
good,you would get yelled at for doing the job you were supposed to do if you were talking. not allowed to talk to other co workers while putting away stock./
good,"I enjoyed the job and a few of the co workers i worked with in the evening shift. Just had issues with manager because of our families disagreements in the past. I felt discriminated against and pick out just for the picking on.   The job itself, i would do again. "
good,"went through 3 managers 2 let go through no fault they could control "
good,"You're always doing something, very rare down time. Which in my opinion is awesome. The DG i worked for had poor standards for employment and it showed."
good,"Fun and easy as long as you keep up with your duties. Loved my position at this company, but I wasn't provided enough hours to make ends meet as a single parent."
good,I was a cashier but did other stuff that was not in my job description and did not get paid for them. Management was decent. How many hours you get depends on you job description.
good,"very busy , kinda a fast pace job , alot of stocking . Most of the mangers are cool . Hardest part is trying to keep the store neat and it gets messed up again ."
good,Customers are great but the management and advancement is bad. I wish there was better advance ment but all i got was empty promises. Been out of the company for 4 weeks and still havent gotten my vacation time.
good,it is hard to accomplish anything that is required because the management is inconsistent in what the duties of the job are. The rules change from day to day.
good,The managers are rude . They did not care about their workers and the hour they give you are not enough . this job would be for college and high school students
good,"Typical Day At Work Varied. Some Days Were Busier Than Others But There Was Really Nothing That Was Ever An Issue. "
good,"The management favors certain employees, and shows no fairness in the amount of pay or on the schedule. The schedule is supposed to be flexible but it's a set schedule every week with no room for discussion on changes. There is no job security or advancement opportunities for anyone he or the DM isn't friends with. Pay is not adequately proportioned among employees, and their is very small possibility of a raise other than cost of living. Does not show appreciation for hard working, honest, dependable employees."
good,I enjoy working at Dollar General at the current time I'm not receiving enough hours. I have not been offered the opportunity to advance in this company. The atmosphere is friendly.
good,It was temporary job. Okay if you are in high school or a summer job. A lot of customer service. I learned how to talk to customers better. A typical day was working stock and on the register.
good,"Liked working there in the beginning, but once I got placed as an asst manger I started seeing things that weren't pleasant. The company demands to much from their employees with not enough pay or boost in hours. Corporate would come down on us if we couldn't get truck or resets done on time, but not look at the fact, they were busy with customers or lack of hours to see things get done."
good,Inconsistent hours and a lot of payroll problems due to opening so many stores at once. It started off ok but became unstable. they would hire people and forget they hired them. You literally had to call management to remind them they hired you and get your proper hours.
good,"Too little hours, depending upon location, the management is a problem. The uniform is simple, the stores differ, the rules are not often clear and well managed"
good,"The whole air around the working environment seems tranquil at first but then you're made to do more than you're paid for , granted work is work but when you're made to do what the manager wants when they want and at what hours they want then it doesn't become the schedule you decide but what the dictate for you , no raises and no actual work balance."
good,"Dollar General is fast-paced, busy, hard work. There is no sitting or resting at any point. The hours you are scheduled weekly are inconsistent, like with any customer service job. Management takes care of its employees."
good,I had really bad back problems. They weren't flexible with my school hours. Had trouble taking off for appointments. The pay was pretty good. GM wasnt very nice.
good,This job was alright when i first started but after the first month i realised that they didnt care how much you helped customers. They only cared how much product you put on back on the shelves.
good,"Exactly what the ""Review Summary"" says.  I am a firm believer of the saying, If your job is to tell me how to do my job, then make sure you know how to do my job.  Definitely not the case here.  The drive is another thing.  It is located out by the tejon outlets, which i guess if you lived on the southwest it wouldn't be to bad, but I live in oildale which makes it a 40 minute trek every day.  If they had new management and paid a little bit more for the drive time then it wouldn't be a bad place to work."
good,"I was put under a lot of pressure when I first began working there, I was interviewing for general sales associates and became a keyholder without really being instructed throughly on my requirements. Throughout my position I managed at least four other stores in the district, all with various forms of ill communicated circumstances and understaffed positions that made the job difficult. I was tasked with a lot of extra duties, and while I don't mind picking up the work, I'd rather be informed of decisions before hand. I was very communicative with my managers, and shared a good relationship with them, and it was redeeming being able to see my efforts enforced within the store's upkeep and business."
good,"Management was useless, never stepped in and actually helped get projects done. Always working with bare bones staffing so it was near impossible to get everything done that you needed to do. Compensation was very unfair. Health insurance was a joke. Costs way too much for very little coverage."
good,"I Enjoyed working with/for Dollar General although the working environment was rather hectic, with a lot of inside employee favoritism and too much drama!  A lot of company demands in such little time and no hours, nor employee help given to complete what was expected!"
good,"Alot of expectations without much appreciation, they do not care if yyour family is dying if y ou don t get 100 percent or above they're complaining about you and not others there are different expectations for different employees"
good,Basic entry level job with little respect among coworkers. Managers do hardly anything all day. Easy going for a high school student who needs some extra money.
good,"It was nice getting to know regular customers, and being able to always know where to find items they needed help with."
good,I would not recommend you working there they want you to do way more than you should and never give you anything in return.  There benefits suck and so does there raises
good,You will stay busy you might get a promotion but its a low percentage and there are no perks for working here except hourly pay and you will be paid every week.
good,They function with the bare minimum amount of employees and give as few hours as they can possibly get away with. Management barely knows basic daily tasks.
good,Overworked and under paid. Corp has many changes to keep in mind. Turnover rate is very high. You pay min wage you get min wage work. Never enough payroll. Always one person in mornings and causes high theft rate.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of stock, inventory, customer service and key holder tasks. I learned to balance a heavy work load with a busy work environment. Workplace culture suffered due to lack of help in the store and number of employees. Hardest part of the job was stocking heavy items on high shelves."
good,everyday is the same. but lacks safety for employees. i have been robbed twice being at theyre store. management on the other hand is very good. its a good job but safety comes first.
good,while at dollar general at first it was a nice place to work with great management but after about a month the old manager was fired and the new manager is the reason im now unemployed within five minutes of arriving and assuming control 98% of the workforce was fired and replaced with no real reasons as to why being given
good,"Fast pace and customers come first not their employees, you get overran daily. It is impossible to get everything done that is asked of an employee at this company"
good,Working with a great staff of employees in  a over great company.  the job and duties were simple and quick to do in a typical day at Dollar General.  Serving customers with a great smile and good attitude was no problem for me on any day at Dollar General.
good,"A very fast pace environment to work in. You rarely got any time off and for me personally I was always covering somebody's shift. The costumers were mostly good, the workplace wasn't too clean."
good,"Lack of security, lack of time off, lack of consideration for you and your family. Hardest part of the job is working all weekend and holidays. Best part is making friends."
good,"Management needs to get with the program, my manager never had our work schedules in time. He was so rude that even customers would complain about him."
good,It was nice working there but management was not the best. The manager accused people of stealing she never checked the cameras or actually talked to the employees.
good,This company is good if it is your first job and you are just trying to get your fee in the door but is not a good job to have for a long period of time  The management is very poor and I don't care about their employees regional and district managers are only there to Yell at you not give you praise
good,Working at dollar general you have to maintain production on an outdated and user unfriendly system. They don't wait till the end of your training to start writing reprimands for production.
good,Dg has ran all the employees off from the distribution center at Scottsville always changing managers and supervisors that doesn't have any experience in warehouses and work/life balance is bad also hours change 1-2 times a year it's very inconsistent
good,"I had to perform all job duties cause there wa lots of hours and little pay and not enough employes. The district managment did nothing to help. I ran the registers,handeled all the money. Unloaded trucks. Stocked shelves."
good,"The day began with an overview of the day and assignments to complete throughout the shift. I learned how to be unbiased of cashiers and management. The customer service aspect of the position is ideal. I love working with the customers, being able to talk to them was a great situation, being able to meet their needs and make them smile at the end of their transactions is the highlight of my day."
good,The days i worked they just wanted to get my twenty-four hours of workable time out of the way so they wouldn't have to worry about adding me into the work schedule. The manager was harsh. He had me work twelve hours for two days in a row. it was my first job and i had never worked before. I got on disability at the age of nineteen. It was the worst work experience. I would have liked to have scheduled breaks and lunches. I only worked part time so I was not able to gget any of the benifits.
good,"the store I worked at worked off a bias by the manager of the store throughout my time there it was a very slow paced work environment, kept very clean and tidy."
good,"A typical day is very fast paced, which is great! "
good,"Working with Dollar General is an okay part time job if you live near one. The work environment isn't terrible as a part-time employee. The few things that should be know when starting there is you have to buy your own black shirt and black pants, while being the cashier you also have to stock the store which can put you out of the line of site of the register. This leads to customers waiting to be checked out and ether coming to find you or yelling for you. Dollar General says it is unprofessional to have a bell and this leads to many inconveniences between customers and staff."
good,"a typical day at work would include checking out customers, stocking truck, recover the store, sweep and mop, clean restrooms, and count money. I learned that you can not make ever customer happy and you need to be very patient. The management was not very great. The hardest part about the job was with dealing with the customers who would not be very understanding to the coporate procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a connection with the regular customers that would come in everyday or every other day."
good,Dollar geberal is a great place to work if you need a slow paced job. It wasnt too bad on my back. Theres not alot of people working so always less drama involved. Overall nice chill job with good people.
good,"They only allow two people per shift. They want the work of 4 being done by one, while the other must stay at the register. They do not understand family emergencies and continuously use fear of loosing ones job to make them put up with it."
good,I love working at dollar general. but I have 3 children. I don't get to spend as much time with my family and the pay sucks. but I love the customers.
good,"You tend to get rude customers, but you learn to work with them regardless. This helps you become more open, and helps you learn to interact with others."
good,"Dollar General was an ok job I wouldn't recommend it.I think that its for younger adults who doesn't have anything going on such as another job, kids,or school."
good,"The hardest part was having to lie to customers, just because the managers refused to allow customers to use our bathrooms. I cleaned out the milk fridge which hadn't been cleaned in years, for a supervisor coming that week. After that, it was never touched again, and got back nasty. Overall, it was an easy job. But the store I worked at, needed better management who thinks about customers, and cleanliness."
good,"Awful work environment. Pay is awful. Upper management doesn't care at all. Can't call off. Don't work here if you don't like drama, rude customers and theives."
good,Its a day to day learning environment where there always room to grow different positions that meet your needs of life a place to interact with people enjoy helper others find what they need feeling of making a difference in someone day to day life
good,"At this job you have to make sure that you can multitask, because if you can't then this job is not for you. If your a cashier you have to stock around the register area/ you can't go within 30ft. of the register area so that you can see the customer come up to the register."
good,"In-store management is great. They've been easy to work with, understanding, and overall made it a good experience, as far as their ability allows. "
good,"Run the cash register, stock merchandise, recover the store, clean the store inside and outside. Management was good, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Everyday was hectic, the management didn't really have a clue how to run a store. There was a high turn over rate of employees. Poor communication. It's been a while since I worked there so maybe they got it together and its a better place to work at."
good,There is no slacking off you are required to do your job plus sometimes pick up other peoples slack. You are expected to go above and beyond when you are there working by yourself for long periods of time.
good,Working here at this one Dollar General was not a very pleasant experience what-so-ever. The management was very very poor. The times I worked was being changed every single day and I had to call every day to know if I was working that day. I earned $7.50 an hour and roughly only received 4 hours a week due to the manager being racist.
good,I did not feel valued by Dollar General.  There were only two mangers that I worked with that seemed to really have it together as far as keeping the store in order. Both managers left for jobs with more order.
good,"It was fun working with my feloow employees, but a lot of people quit so that made work hard and we changed our Direct Manager 3 times through a year of me working there."
good,"Quick paced physical job with minimal training. Promotion from within and standard compensation package. Great group of co workers. Talented staff. This is a good place to work for unlimited overtime and great job security in an ever changing market. Substantial pay, very competitive in today's market. Hours are always heavy even in off season."
good,Good place too shop but the assistant managers suck they don't do any work At all. They just sit in the back and walk around the store on there phones. But its a stop between a gas station and a grocery store
good,"More stocking and shelving than anything, minimum wage, no benefits, possibility to advance in company, numerous locations... Relocation, definitely helps to know your demographic."
good,Good but if it was a different manager it would have been better! ! The manager was mean to the staff but one who she was friends with who she gave more hours but the other employees including myself didn't get hours like her friend.
good,"The job was pretty hectic. Only 2 people mostly were working at a time, meaning only one person at the register while the other was keeping the store in order. The store was also too small for all of the merchandise it carried, leading to customer complaints. Usually I would go in, clock in and then get right to work. Not really a smooth transition. The hardest part of the job was when I was the only one manning the register with the line backed up to the end of the store. The co-workers were great to work with, for the most part."
good,"i would usually stock stuff and be the cashier "
good,The company needs to hire more employees to the stores that need the help. Most of the stores are very nice/neat but some need serious help. They should manage some better.
good,Hours varied with little pay.  Customers were wonderful.  It was close to my home.  Company is okay to work for.  We had poor management.  Loved being close to home.
good,They do not pay the employees for what they work for. And it has no good benefits. is no a safety place to work. The don't fallow the polices
good,Always stocking when I was suppose to be a cashier. working long hours. No culture. Never organized. boxes are everywhere. stock room you could never see the floor or walk in. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,I would run a register and stock then close the store up at night with one manager there. I learned to balance tasks to get both my stocking and cashier duties done at once.
good,I liked working there I needed more hours at the time but I always got called in to work when they called I took it for the extra hours basically I went to work and ran the register allay and stocking a little if I worked nightshift I usually moping help clean the store.
good,Not the job to get you to next level but will secure a job for you friendly customers slow pace relaxing and fun coworkers at your side i suggest those who need extra cash on the side to work here
good,The management team did not care about its customers what so ever. Was rude to the employes and would occasionally leave the store to have a sales member run out.
good,"The training was was good. The managers was nice, and easy to get along with. "
good,My customers were my favorite thing about my job. Dollar General as a company worries about what you can only due for them and never any recognition for how hard you work or how much time you invest with them. Pay is good for the managers and assistant managers and work load is not evened out. would not recommend this job for money pay reasons or advancement in career either.
good,"When I worked here, our store was a horrible mess. Everything on the shelves was out of place and disorganized. There were rolltainers and uboats everywhere all the time, like days after the truck dropped them off. We were always way understaffed with only two people working there on a normal day - me, unpacking the truck and recovering shelves, while running the register, and a 3rd key low-management person, just unpacking the truck. There was no way 2 people could get done what the store manager demanded of us, especially when one was at the register most of the time with customers. I did like my coworkers though and they tried to accomodate your schedule if possible."
good,A typical day involves stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned that there are many layouts that work for Dollar General stores. The management varies. The coworkers vary. The hardest part is the closing shift. The best part is interacting with the customers.
good,Worst workplace I've ever worked. Very rude management and some discrimination. Very inexcusable hour shortage. Clock in/out computer always disabled.
good,"Typical retail. Not fun, minimum wage, but it's a job. Cashiers get no power at all, so expect to feel stupid a lot of the time. You can't even do things like voiding out an item or a return without having the manager come up to the front of the store."
good,I loved my job. But since it wasn't taken over by another company there were a lot of expectations that were not reasonable since they kept cutting the payroll.
good,The store could be more organized. The customers are can be hard to handle at times but I have learned how to be more patient and have a better understanding of dealing with the public.
good,"Very poor management and store keep up. So many drugs going around, including within management and cashiers. Needs random drug testing and store check ups."
good,The best part of the job was seeing some of the same costumers walk in. They always seemed very nice. Managers were hit & miss with me. At the time the hardest part of the job was putting items back were they belonged. It was my first job. It took me a while to pick up my speed. Coworkers seemed to have problems with each other. I never had confrontations with coworkers there.
good,Overall I rate this job a 3 concerned about safety with only2 people being in the store at all times unless it was truck day.
good,"There really is no typical day here. Some days customers made things difficult, especially the rude ones. Some of the coworkers were alright. There were a few good ones. There really is not a difficult part to this job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but I was a part-time sales associate and I was promised 25+ hours per week, but was only receiving 12-14 hour s per week. Which at minimum wage was barely gas money to get there and to school. If I were getting the promised hours and if the associates got a more decent pay I would've stayed at the job."
good,I need a job that can work with my school hours.i need something that is slightly more flexable and my boss is only working with me so much on the hours.
good,Not the job I was expecting. Hours are critique and unpredictable. The pay should be more for what you have to do especially working at night.
good,"The store was cluttered, assistant manager was not a people person. Schedule would be changed without notice. They would call and tell you they did not need you on different days"
good,job is ok but employee advancement and job pay are not really good. They could pay more attention to good employees and advance them through the company but that's not what happens here.
good,"A typical day at work for me is arriving at 7:30 am to count the drawers down and the change fund as well as the cigarettes. after that is all counted it is usually 8:00 am and I unlock the doors. My manager usually comes in around that time and she does all the paperwork and stuff she needs to do. I run the register and I occasionally go to the bank to complete the deposit and get change for the change fund. It is usually me and the manager there until 12:00 pm or a little later. I usually have unruly customers on a daily basis which I handle perfectly well by keeping my composure and staying professional. "
good,Typical day would require doing the truck and keeping up with the store. I learned how to manage people and work with new attitudes all the time. Management was OK. My co workers were fun and energetic. Job was fairly easy no hard parts to it. Most enjoyable part was i worked with my best friend and we were able to plan and concur.
good,"It was my first job in a while. It wasn't hard, I learned how to assist many different types of customers. Management can range from not there to great. Some of the best people I know work there. It can be not a safe environment."
good,I enjoyed the customer relations experience and the job itself was good. My only issue was the high expectations of upper management with the minimal work hours allotted to employees.
good,"Very hectic, fast paced, rude customers."
good,"Opportunity for advancements are there due to high turnover rates. Corporate managers lack respect and usually don't care about there employees. If you go into overtime you'll get reprimanded even if you had no choice. If you work too much over time, Upper management will cut your hours worked in the system which results in less pay than what you actually earned. You must always be busy and never stand around even if for a minute. The relationships with customers and other workers are the best part of the job. Pay is low considering the usual work load. Yearly raises are only 25 cents. There are no in store benefits such as discount cards. The company thinks EVERYBODY is stealing from them, especially the employees, it says this even in the training videos. If you let management know you have full availability you'll likely be called into work a lot and even to work at other store in the district. That's the best way to earn overtime without getting in trouble. I spent more time at work than at home so that has to tell you something. There is no rules for calling in sick and no consequences for too many times. If you run cash and the store doesn't receive the 25 surveys for that month then you'll get on trouble. Overall, its a good company if you just really need a job or starting out but career wise, you'd be better off finding something better unless you can get into a corporate position."
good,this is an easy job but it has a high turnover rate and i'm guessing because of the low wages they pay.   but i really do love the people that come in there and thats why i'm still there!
good,The Dollar General Store needs to get a better balance on the staffing issues in their stores. The turn-over rate is very high because this is very demanding job.
good,"A day at Dollar General is ok. I learned how to be patient when it comes to customer service. Management was all over the place. My coworkers they kept me going very nice people. the hardest part about the job was finding where items went nothing was really in order. The best part of the job was the staff making me laugh, it makes the time go past way faster."
good,"Dollar General is a great starter job.  You make great friends with the customers, and you get to make sure they have a fun experience in Dollar General."
good,Work as a cashier; the management was fair; I loved working with co-workers; the hardest part of the job was standing all day but quickly got used to it; and the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with the customers.
good,"The best thing about this job was the customers. Some you would see everyday, and sometimes more than once a day. You always stay busy and there was never a dull moment."
good,"Store closed due to a sink hole,reopened after fixed. Managers were fired twice in 6 months. This was a difficult place to work. Theft was high and they only would allow a cashier and a manager to be in the store in the evenings. This made it very difficult to get the job done."
good,I enjoyed working at dollar general for the amount of time that I did. I believe that the company needs to take a look at some management skills.
good,"If you do not have a life outside of work, then this is the job for you. You will be working 50 plus hours a week, (on average I worked 63/week). You cannot have a day off without a phone call from your store and do not ever think you will get a true vacation, because it will not happen. If you break down the pay vs. the hours worked, it is not feasible for a working parent to hold this job."
good,"Good for people starting in the workforce, but does not make for a good career. There are no benefits available for part time help, there are a little more for full time employees, but not worth it."
good,Many customers throughout the day. Customers are tough but great experience. A lot of work put into the job. Must maintain a clean work place while at work but also take care of customers.
good,"I like my coworkers but I feel that I am not accomplishing enough at Dollar General. I would like to be able to try to move up with my career. A typical day at Dollar General is usually very busy, I am on the cash register a lot and I do some recovery, some stocking from totes and some freight stocking. I also do item pricings and markdowns."
good,"worked their for a few months, they would not send help when needed, and when you asked for help management would get annoyed."
good,Dollar General was not a good company to work for towards the end of my time there. Drove to a store managed staff. micro managed to death with that company.
good,They were not very understanding or caring about their team. They didn't pay enough for the work you did. They expected way too much from one person.
good,"I am able to say that I enjoyed working for Dollar General on the weekends, and my store manager never gave me any trouble in reference to my school schedule. My gratitude for being able to  completed three degrees while being employed at DG is immeasurable. "
good,"Loved working with others and the public. I learned a lot while working there. "
good,the hardest part is rude customers but there are some very nice customers also the typical day of work consists of putting out stock and running the register
good,Needs better management to be such a big corporation. The employees all got along and enjoyed the customer. If management was better then the company would thrive.
good,The hardest part of the job is when you have to deal with drunk customers that come in to the store and get aggressive towards the staff.
good,"If you like working everyday and not getting any praise, you will love working here. Long days no time off. No backup, expect you to work all the time. Same thing day in and day out."
good,"I provided great customer service during the time in which I worked at Dollar General. I was a very assertive, hard working team player. Although the store location in which I worked was operated under poor management, I learner how to handle customer matter in the most precise way. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and satisfying their expectation of great customer service."
good,Salem Dollar General had problems with losing people due to the manager. The manager would find ways to fire you and then find new people and do the same thing all over again. Dollar General has lost maybe over five people due to the management terminating them for a bad cause.
good,"I was hired on as an Assistant Manager, and told that the Manager of the store I was going to was under investigation and would likely soon be fired.Therefore I was trained at a different location. As expected, the manager was let go about a month or so after I started in her store. She left things disorganized and chaotic, but with a little direction from a senior manager, I was able to manage the store on my own for several months. When a replacement manager was finally brought in, she basically was worse than the one who had been fired. The company overall was like many other retail places I have worked for, and not significantly good or bad to work for. The rude customers and the inexperienced employees are what made things difficult to work there."
good,I enjoyed my job...even over the very strenuous duties of stocking every single day due to the lack of employees due to lack of pay and over worked hours.
good,"Stressful work load . D M expectations change with thw wind."
good,"Fun Place to work. Fairly supportive Management. Decent amount of Staff. I enjoyed working along side my Co workers. my Duties we including but not limited to opening Store . Counting safe, receiving Loads. Cashering , money Loans to Cashiers, customer service and Walking with District Managers."
good,I worked there for a few months while going to college. I got along with the people pretty well since I'm very much a people person.
good,"I've worked at Dollar General most of the summer, and i do not enjoy it. The hours are inconsistent. The pay is as to be expected, minimum wage. The manager is not very professional and not good at the job, but that is just my opinion"
good,"Working in a safe environment makes the job comfortable.Meeting Expectations by the end of the shift can be a challenge.The challenges on the job are interesting,and can be alot of fun.Being able to learn how to get along with co-workers is very important to perform productivity as a team.Managing Inventory can be a little difficult but is always an enjoyable task for the day."
good,I do believe the dollar general needs to work on better taking care of their employee's and trying to give them more benefits and crediting them for their work.
good,"Very unorganized, unwelcoming, unpleasant work environment. Management all the way up to the DM was very unprofessional and dishonest"
good,You are the only one in the store most of the time. Putting merchandise on the sale floor by your self. The employee work hard.
good,Always had a lot of fun working with coworkers and helping customers. Constantly staying busy with either cashiering or stocking shelves or helping a customer with a question.
good,"typical day is 14 hours"
good,"Decent amount of red tape and politics"
good,"If you want a career that allows you to grow and climb, Dollar General would be the company to work for...They promote people quickly within the stores."
good,"Dollar General,"
good,"Normal day would be spent working the registers and stocking"
good,"As with all retail shops, Dollar General is just another retail store with underpaid employees and unmotivated management. My Co-Workers were wonderful people, but we were lead by someone who didn't have the idea of leadership completely understood. Easy job, but the hours were given to the more favorable people than equally distributed."
good,"We're always busy. The customers that return constantly are always the nicest. But more than often you have customers that are very rude and disrespectful. Normally anyone with kids lets them destroy the store and you have little to no say in the matter."
good,"Working for Dollar General has been a good experience. I enjoy working with the public and it has been rewarding. When and if I have time to walk away from the register, I am responsible to stock the front area of the store and keep it neat and clean. The hardest part of this job is having time to complete all tasks that are expected."
good,"for the most part it was a good job Hardest part of the job was being short handed"
good,"I work 10-12 hours without break/lunch. Management was a bully, working conditions-insect/rat issues, stockroom unorganized and when you would complain about anything happening instore management would take away your hours or suaspend you for a week. I think when you are management level you have to work to maintain goal outline by district and Dollar General guideline, rumor inside store and morale was very low."
good,"Enjoy just helping people and making them smile."
good,"Dollar General stores have good merchandise and staff is helpful and friendly, the job is easy and consists of cleaning and helping customers."
good,Its a good company but my experience my third time working for the company wasn't the best. I would have liked a better last experience.
good,"A typical day at work will leave you handling all transactions, recovering, and gathering baskets while a lead sales associate is free to do whatever. They will change the schedule during the week add you to work, but never call until you are already late."
good,The job would've been amazing if they would've have a accurate assistant manager. She would call me on days I didnt work and went to classes and would tell me i did just for me to have to skip my classes and find out i was right and didnt have to work.
good,Enjoyed working with the public.  Wish the DM would have been more hands on and involved with my store.  Was able to turn the store around and did not receive any appreciation from my DM or corporate.
good,i enjoy working with my employee we had friendly customer love putting up weekly ads and display and changing aisle for different holiday season
good,Well I loved the customers. WE had no manager there and so the assistant got all the work of a manager but was not alowed to make changes to the store like we really needed. the other key holder slacked so much that everytime i came in i had to do the work of two people and still maintain a smile on my face. The General Manager was not GAY-Friendly and treated me and another lesbian there unfairly and was extra hard on us. over all it was a good first job but the people could have been better.
good,I worked at two different stores. The one on frankford was great i loved it their it pained me to leave. I lived far from their but i was looking to move in the area. My boss told me if i didnt go to any store with her i would be fired and i had two kids to provide for. SO i went to erie and it was the worst experience ever. I hated every moment their. I worked less hours the customers were terrible the staff was just as bad and i couldnt stand it
good,Started going down hill when the new Store Manager came in. I did my job to the best of my ability and within a month was told that I had to be re-trained.
good,"Taking care of customers"
good,"I work too late at night"
good,"Not the absolute worst job but, definitely will not go back to work at the store level for this company."
good,"I enjoyed working here because it was a neighborhood store and I got to know a lot of the customers.  My co-workers were hard working but the management was lacking.   The line could be 10 people long but the managers would sit in the back on personal phone calls.  There were also questionable practices, such as, ""throwing away"" merchandise rather than sending it back to the warehouse or donating it."
good,"A typical work day consisted of stocking, zoning, and operating a cash register. I learned how to effectively zone and stock store. The hardest part of my job was trying to get a schedule to fit my needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers."
good,"Employees were not a team atmosphere, management does not train. Very out of order"
good,"No real room for advancement. Upper Management, read: district managers and above, don't realize what actually goes on in the store."
good,Was asked to go work at other stores to get them running correctly. Was not that big of a deal but had to go on my days off. I also kept having to go to the same stores over and over then would get in trouble for my store starting to fall behind.
good,The actual work was nice with a small retail store. Customers were polite and friendly. The management on the other hand could not keep promises that were made.
good,"its only part time lots of hard work, you learn a lot of good skills like, people skills, how to work under pressure, staying calm in stressful situations. the hardest part of the job is the closing paperwork."
good,the job is ok. It is  really the management and some employees.
good,A typical day at work is moving tons of freight from the stockroom to the sales floor. The hardest part of the job is knowing when you leave you have been underpaid and overworked.
good,"A day, is always working freight and trying to clean up the store. Along with the daily things that need to be done, such as, pricing things, and ect."
good,The store manager and the district manager were two of the meanest and unprofessional people I have ever encountered in my work history. They made the work place a hostile environment and had no regard for employees or customers.
good,"Each individual is going to have their own opinions about a job; nevertheless, I did not feel that this company took care of their employees.  A typical day would include assisting customers, of course, then cleaning the store and constantly stocking the shelves, while maintaining a register. As a lead clerk you were responsible to assist with keeping the inventory count as accurate a possible, plus completing all necessary paper work at the end of each shift. "
good,Work schedule always posted late and they change it weekly.
good,Dollar general was a good start off job.Minimum wage pay push me to look else where for employment.
good,"a tyoical day starts with counting down the drawer to make sure the money was even for your shift. i learned customer service and devloped a scence in how to talk to people i truly belive that i learned how to talk articulately at this job, i beleive its where i gained a pleasant attitude for people."
good,you are pulled in many different directions by 2 differnt managers that do not agree on tasks.
good,Manager was very unappealing and co-workers were like zombies while working.
good,"I would have to put stock on the shelves while also having to work a register and police the store for shoplifters. I learned that people with steal anything if given the chance. The hardest part was policing the store and doing all my other duties as well. I usually worked with one of two other people during the day and only one other people during closing, which was usually the busiest times."
good,"i love going to work and talking with the customers. had fun working with my co-workers,laughing stocking and getting to know each other, at dollar general we are like family.the most enjoying part of my job is seeing the customers smile."
good,I didn't enjoy working at this job due to the manager at the time
good,"Working at dollar general is very demanding.  Very fast pace , your  work is never done ."
good,I would go to work and not expect it be fulfilling. they days were often boring and the coworkers were also the same.
good,I always went to work with a smile on my face and i was always prepared to do my job at my best on wed i would unload the trucks and help put the products where it needed to go. The hardest part of my job was getting along with the manager.
good,"Working at Dollar General is a lot of work and my day is definitely full from start to finish. To start off my day I count all the money for the day and verify that what's supposed to be there is there, as well as fill out all my morning paperwork. I check all emails and work tasks for the day and begin my to do list. During store hours I manage my associates to make sure they're staying on tasks, and meeting company standards. We process shipment while assisting customers, checking in store vendors, and recover the store throughout the day. I also process store refunds/exchanges."
good,"I enjoy my co workers and the customers that come in. I have learned to listen to customer needs and wants and I have also learned how to respond appropriately and efficiently. Management is alright, but the hardest part is some customers can be stubborn but I remain calm and do my best. I do all I can when I can. despite the low cut hours and minimum wage pay, I continue on doing my best."
good,While working there I learned more about the managing field and got more experience in it. I loved my job and the customers that came in. The hardest part about my job was working with just me and one other cashier for a close because of someone not coming in and not being able to get someone to come in and help.
good,"it was a good store, but manager was not good to work with, needed to be cleaned more due to mice, good people"
good,I enjoyed working at this company and working with the public
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. I learned how to efficiently work as part of a team.
good,"There are no typical days at work. Each day is a bit different. Physically challenging environment, lifting heavy cases from rolling carts that were broken or not safe. Left little room and potential danger to customers while stocking shelves. Safety of customers and personnel and sanitation of public facility appeared to be at the bottom of the list for most personnel. The hardest part of the job was trying to catch thieves stealing and getting management to provide the proper equipment to assist. Regional manager required submissive, job scared employees to jump at a moments notice, while general manager makes up an excuse and then lies to cover up  the truth of an employee's termination, on more than one occasion. "
good,"If you want a job that keeps you moving, this is the job for you!"
good,A regular day is stocking shelves and waiting on customers.
good,The job was great when I started eight years ago but the last couple years the company has changed to where they put money above people. They are constantly cutting hours which causes customers to complain when they have to wait longer. Add to that the manager putting his personal issues above his work so everyone else has to cover him and it makes for a tough work place. Some of the customers are a bright spot to the day. I like being able to assist people as much as we can but with lack of help that isn't always a possibility. I have learned how to treat people like I would want to be treated even when that is not an easy task.
good,"Cashier - greeting customers and handling items"
good,too many hours for me. customers are very rude and impatient. 
good,"Stressful! Bad management who do not want to assist to achieve goals. They want you to perform magic while not giving you enough hours to hire. Work, work, work, until you have no life left again! Fair pay, not commesurate with your efforts, though."
good,Wasn't there long enough to say much. All I did was set up the store. It was hard because the rails were so heavy. I didn't enjoy it.
good,"A typical work day is pretty slow for me. I don't really do too much. Just cash people out. I haven't learned too much because I wasn't even trained. I was just told ""Go in the back and ask a co-worker what to do."" My co-workers don't do ANY work they're supposed to do."""
good,Dollar General is a very good place to work but I feel that management doesn't care much about how clean the store is. A typical day for me would be going in early morning or late afternoon to help stock the store or do customer orders
good,It would be nice not to have to hear about a person's personal life over and over with the same story everyday. My favorite part is the office work that mainly occurs at close of the day....I really enjoy office work.
good,"I worked a lot, learned a lot, and got tired of it. The management was alright, I pretty much had to take over my last few months there. It was a lot to take on for a 22 year old. Co-workers were okay, when we had people that wanted to actually work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress to make store perfect twenty-four/seven. The best part of the job was getting to know my customers really, really well. I miss them dearly."
good,You get there count your till get your day started then you recover or stock whatever need to be done
good,"I enjoy working with the public, and staying busy. I feel comfortable in leadership position, enjoy closings, and store openings. Work well with team employees.."
good,I loved my job at the dollar general. I got along with all of my co-workers. I opened and/ or closed the store almost every day. The only problem I had with the job was I went through 4 store managers while I was there. The last one that came in had no experience as a s tore manager and would not take any help or advice. She would change the schedule on a daily basis and then take the schedule home with her at the end of her shift so it messed a lot of workers including me on when we were to b at work. THis is the reason I am no nolger employes there myself.
good,It's a laid back job and I like conversing with customers everyday.
good,"Help customers, cash register. Some management was okay some assocates were okay"
good,I learned how to work under pressure and get the job done in a timely manner.I worked well with my co workers.The hardest part of the job was to satisfy the manager.The most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers.
good,"The main part of the job was cashing customers out, and stocking shelves. Besides the customer service, it was an inpersonal job. The management lacked values, but are slowly learning. The co-workers were fun to work with but could be judgemental."
good,I learned that your work doesnt always represent the perception others have for you. Its about personality along with work ethic.
good,As A Store Manager my days were gratifying
good,"The company in whole is awesome, however the district needs improvement.The higher authorities need to learn how to talk to those below them without making them feel beneath them. The hardest part is not being able to manage for having to be on the register and run the store by myself. These store are becoming mini Walmarts and should at no time have only one person in the store. That is poor customer service, there should be three people in these stores at all times."
good,Not very busy. Not many people did their jobs. I enjoyed when it was time for stocking and I enjoyed working with the register.
good,cleaning and stocking rotating inventory
good,They only pay there key holders 10.50 an hour. They dint really train you. You get thrown in there and basically have to teach yourself. Most store managers are really young. Your hours can be 35 plus one week and 10 the next. They up and transfer when they want to. And they want you to catch every person that steals they do not care about there employees at all. Make this job temporary
good,"I hated my manger , he was so petty and miserable. they always wanted up too clean the store but it just was dirty. They did not have any security to protect the safe and we were in a really bad neighborhood."
good,"Not a place to get serious  about. Your not appreciated, you have to keep on the manager to get hours to make a pay check.  Even when your working your butt off and leaving most in the dust! Someone else already has their nose right up the managers butt. the other employees you work near dont like you moving so fast and efficiently bc you make them look bad? Forget working therthere except as last result."
good,This wasnt the best job but I stuck to it. Often get blamed for others mistakes was not the best environment and the pay was horrible for everything we had to do.
good,You don’t get the support needed from corporate or the district manager. You put in any where from 60 to 80 hours but only get a salary for 30 hours per week. Often you are the only person working in the store.
good,I had a manager who would make fun of my height and make me feel super bad about myself blaming me for things not being where they should be even if I knew is wasn't the one who stocked them. The manager had also at one point told a lady her three year old daughter couldn't use the bathroom because she didn't want to clean it and made the mom and child leave the store and the little girl peed herself. She does it to all customers
good,Not enough payroll to succeed on all expectations.  Required to work 48 hours a week but end up working 70-80. Only get one day off.  If you are over on payroll the manger has to work the shifts to make payroll.
good,"I never felt wanted at this store. Everyone seemed to dislike me, all because at the time I required some assistance being a new member of the store. I didn't know exactly how to do everything perfectly the first time, and instead of politely correcting me, my manager would scold me and embarrass me  in front of customers."
good,"This job is for young adults with no children. Be ready to work, a lot. Always come prepared. Be on time. Keep a positive attitude. Remain calm and precise"
good,"Long hours , very physical, never enough people to do what they want done! Work very long hours but there are a lot of locations pay is descent and the insurance is expensive"
good,The company expects alot out of u. They give you a lot of tasks to finish in just a little amount of time. The managers are also rude and only care about themselves.
good,"I’d really rather not say how I feel about Dollar General, because if I did they wouldn’t have any employees because they don’t appreciate them at all!!!"
good,There were a lot of management and associate issues and problems and also higher ups did not support this store and management very well Manager and 3 other associates left at one time because of this
good,They have a bad habit about treating employees like objects to make them money other than people. They also make up vacation time and you will have 80 hours and not miss a day and end up with 20.
good,"I ran register and worked totes if I was cashiering or food rolltainers but the RT's were always mixed up. You were running from the back of the store to the front of the store, which waste time. The training for the position was poorly done. Get in trouble for doing voids but if a customer wants a price there is only 2 ways to do it, either the little machine that was never up front or the register."
good,"If you’re looking for a stepping stone job, you’ve found the place. Plus, they’re currently hiring."
good,I was overworked and underpaid. Management gives you too much to do and not enough time to do it. They expect too much of there employees. They mess with your hours. Over working you or giving you too little to live on.
good,"My hiring manager was awesome, she recognized that I have a good work ethic & I got recognized for it after a few weeks I was promoted and got a raise. "
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for because It helps you the experience retail It helps you prepare for other retail stores for the future . It’s good company over all I enjoy working for them.
good,Running cash register and stocking shelves a lot to do in one sitting. Company always cutting hours. Mostly part time work. Older workers should have some benefits. The company is too big to have benefits only to full time workers.
good,i would rather not leave a review about this employer. Pay is not very competitive with other job opportunities out there. Management shows favoritism among employees.
good,It was okay to work there. I just worked a lot and did a lot for being new to the job and wished I had more help. Not terrible to work at but you are busy.
good,Great place to work loved every minute I worked just wish the pay was a little more and could keep staff. Work was more than I got paid but being paid weekly was a bonus.
good,The company is great to you as long as they need you then when they dont they will find any little reason or try to make one up to throw you away no matter how long you worked for the company or how good you were to them.
good,"cleaning, making deposits, operating registers,stocking,mopping,not much because I've worked at places like this before.People of all ages, dealing with some managers,helping customers"
good,Stocking the shelves. Checking for out dated products to toss. Customer Service is great when myself and a few others are working. Pay raises are not adequate.
good,"The stress level is not worth the tiny paycheck. They expect the daily paperwork and drawers to be processed in fifteen minutes without error and abiding by their strict rules, but it's impossible to do without bending rules. So that's what we did. Every day we'd get better and better at bending rules to get the job done correctly. But still, it was never enough pay. Not even close."
good,A typical day working at dollar general was that it started off slow in the mornings and it would pick up around noon . My job was to run the cash register everyday so I had to learn how to work the register.
good,"It was tough at the time, i was still in school with a month left to graduate, and the pay rate was 7.50 an hour, which isn’t good for me anymore. They wouldn’t give me even a quarter raise. I dealt with it more and more and after 2 more months of coming and putting work first, I still didn’t even get a raise and got ended up fired for matters that shouldn’t be. I am a hard worker who always shows up on time and is ready for the day."
good,"Working at the Dollar General served the purpose that I was seeking at the time, making basic ends meet.  I believe as time has progressed, the company has changed a lot of things and do things more efficient than they during my prior employment."
good,"Too much work & not enough payroll & pay! Payroll disappears into thin air. I love my job, but you have very little work/life balance. You would think they would implement behind the counter alarms for all these robberies!"
good,"I enjoyed working there. But there were many changes in store management and upper management. I did my job, but lots of co workers always complained."
good,My experience working at dollar general I’m sure may differ from others but from what I’ve gathered the management needs a serious re working. I’m my case my store manager is constantly getting  customers complaints for being rude in which I have to apologize for. I am the only one at my store that takes initiative and I feel like I’m miss-used.
good,Job was good but the pay and management was horrible.Management was inconsistent and the turnover rate was bad. The hours were fine most times but the duties and responsibilities were too much for the hours worked.
good,Over worked and under paid! Not the job to get if you have a family! This job is not worth the stress. No weekends off unless you ask for them. This job is not what everyone says it is.
good,"Overall, I liked it in the beginning but that store is all (he said she said) stuff. I never knew if I was full time or part time, I’d hear one thing and someone would tell me something else... never got enough hours and not paid well, not enough to support 2 kids with."
good,Company was always short on help. It seemed like I was always working. Not a lot of personal or free time. Training was beyond insufficient. Everything seemed out dated.
good,You get way to few hours to even pay a few bills. Great job if u have mom and dad paying all your bills. It is impossible to get consistent enough hours to even plan out your bills
good,The store is very productive but it also has its down side. Dollar General doesn’t have any coverage so the slack fall on the 2 to 3 people who are on that shift.
good,"working here is not for everyone.  It is a fast paced environment and if you are a key you will be working alone 50% or more of the time.  In that time that you are alone you are still required to get work done no matter how busy that you are.  If there is good management at the store that you work at everything should be fine,  However power can go to peoples heads and good managers that seem promising can easily slip into no so good managers. For example if the manager is always worried about truck and truck only then they will not allow for the time for recovery of the store to be done.  Then the store will be an absolute mess and they will continuously complain about it and not fix it.  I don't know the job can be great as long as the management is good."
good,"Dollar General is a good entry-level job for young adults first entering the workforce. Coworkers are generally pretty friendly and easy to get along with and the average day is not all that taxing. However, DG offers very few benefits and very little PTO for the first couple of years of working there. The pay is also absolutely atrocious, barely paying over minimum wage during the first years, with only slight 25 to 50 cent raises per year. Management is also lacking, the company prefering to hire new managers from outside the company, often wasting time and money to train them, and refusing to promote those already working there who have decades worth of experience."
good,I enjoyed helpin with truck amd helpin customer's...as far as pay it sucks...not enough hrs...too many demands amd not enough pay..they always cuttin hrs...cant live off the pay
good,You want be there long if your a cocasion person .blacks only. Very bigh passed job people are nice but there all black no whites not a safe place to work lots of gang members they do celibrate a lot feed tou lunch and stuff like that
good,"Depending on your manager and asm, this job could be great or horrible. They push you constantly to try and get almost impossible tasks done with only 2 people working in the whole store. Often the managers are rude and sit in the office instead of actually helping their employees."
good,"You will be left alone in the store for 2 to 4 hours, you will be expected to take care of the customers while getting stock out onto the shelves. That is true if you are a key holder."
good,"Night shift at our particular location only staffs 2 employess even with the volume of customers we recieve. Very limited training, more of a throw you to the wolves mentality."
good,"When the hard working manager left her replacement was awful and the store declined quickly. I learned to listen instead of gossip. Customer service is always first priority. Your smile is the most important part of the uniform so always wear it. And remember if you have time to lean, you have time to clean!"
good,A typical workday begins with getting my register draw ready starting my till and signing on. Immediately I check to see if any customers need any assistance and if not I jump right into the seven-day workflow. I loved the clientele of this small town store and knew everyone by name. I thoroughly loved working in this store the only downside was the pay. I could not sustain gas in my car let alone my family.
good,"It's easy to advance in the company, as long as you pay attention to your work and follow company policies. There is a high employee turn-over, mostly because the pay is minimum wage and the hours can be all over the place."
good,"It's a good place to work. You have to be able to interact and communicate with others, and must be able to handle money. The need to keep the store stock is a must."
good,They are never organization. They get mad if you wanna call off. You don't get a brake at all. They never have enough workers. If your new they make u do everything we they watch you
good,Basically your a maid at the end of the shift the manager goes in the back to count the drawer you are reasonable for doing everything in the store from garage to mopping
good,They have no concern for there managers let me go with no qustion after 6 years just because the new manger wanted her assistant and not me . Corporate didnt even ask .
good,"The manager was a little bi polar, she was ok but had some issues. The company was slow in paying at first until got on clock to sign in then paid good, but left store to help open another store and it took almost a month to get paid. The pay was minimum wage and only scheduled to work mostly week ends. I left to obtain full time position, and the pay was much more than minimum wage which I needed ."
good,They need to pay there employees more money an hire more people to work the stores they work there employees to hard an there managers are on salary they tell you when you start you only got to work 48 hours that's funny cause they work you a lot more than that an there insurance is terrible
good,"Don't get paid enough, work to hard, not trained well, they expect too much, the customers at my store were rude it didn't matter how nice you were, never say anything positive about your work"
good,Dollar General is conducive for a college student because they allow no overtime and they never give enough payroll to fulfill their expectations of management and staff. Part time hours is not enough time to set planagrams and kick freight. Too much physical work for the pay.
good,"A typical day at work at Dollar General can do one of two ways from my 1 year of experience. Some days are super slow and you can get a lot of work done, and trust me, you'll have more than enough to do. Or you could have a terribly busy day and/or night and never get anything done."
good,"Working there had its ups and downs, the specific store I worked at probably wasn't the best, but it was fair overall. I'd say that it's good for a first job, but probably only until a better opportunity comes around."
good,Very difficult to complete tasks. High expectations for very little available labor. Difficult family/work balance. No control on ordering or pricing.
good,"Well the dg i worked at had three managers over the past years. Your typical day is get there by 6 and unload stock into store. Trailers come ever three days depending on what store you work at.  Its a job, not one you want to work at for years and years. There is no room to move up."
good,I stayed with the company far longer than I initially planned due to the people I worked with being amazing. I enjoyed the community of customers and employees immensely and felt part of that. Unfortunately I do not agree with how their upper management are choosing to handle things. They seem far more concerned with potential employee theft (even if there is no evidence) and enforcing rules with no exceptions than they are about customer service. But that was just my store/district and every place is different I suppose.
good,First u count out your drawer . Than help any customers if there are any And if there is not then start going to unpack boxes and putting the merchandise Away. It Just didn’t pay enough for all the work I did and the pay itself wasn’t enough
good,Thankful for the experience but need more money for the challenges faced and there was no sense of nothing except for the cashiers and assistant manager will never work there again
good,"The work is rather easy. Each shift you were either stocking/cleaning the store or running register/cleaning store. "
good,"Overall I would have stayed longer at the location I was working at. The Dollar General had and still has very poor management. The manager at the store now, has a terrible attitude not only towards employees but also customers."
good,Worked my way to Assistant manager in 2 years. Was working to be a manager but the DM didn’t like me and I was moved from store to store so I wasn’t happy.
good,"The company is great to work at as long as you don't need time off for personal health reasons. The hours can be hectic because it is a very busy environment, management has a desire to be better with more hands on along with better training program"
good,"Dollar general is a company that's nice to start your job searching career, not to be long term. because if your not a store manager then its not really worth all the stress and headache some stores are great with store manager that tries to help you with raises and advancement with in the company."
good,"Dollar General is an okay environment to work in, but it's also very stressful. The hours are pretty flexable and they usually work with you even if you're in school."
good,They are not very organized in there schedule making. The pay is not worth what u have to put up with. Schedule is not flexible. Is not really the job for a single parent
good,They dont gave a steady schedule. And the management is always changing because people either quit or get fired. Your standing the whole time and it's usually you by yourself up front.
good,Hours are rough and would think for a million dollar company they would have better health ins at a cost that single parents could afford amd still live. Offer no type of employee ins that they help with
good,AS an employee working at Dollar General we try to keep up with a clean well stocked environment to give customers the satisfaction they want and need cause our main priority is to put our customers first.
good,It paid the bills. Management needed improvement. Security of store needed improvement. Schedule changed constantly as well as management. Lacked communication.
good,"The manager I worked for is very rude to customers and chooses favorites and then cuts the hours of the best workers that she didn't like. I really liked working there, couldn't deal with the manager."
good,"It has potential to be a great place to work, however, the company needs to invest in paying the employees a more competitive wage. Implement better safety structure for staff and customers."
good,Didn’t like working there the management was very poor they didn’t supply uniforms it was very hard to work there but the people I worked with made it fun
good,"Great for part-time and full-time associates, but no life to work balance for management. Training provided for outside hires into management is offered and given, but not to inside employees looking to and having the abilities to advance."
good,I was Lead Sales Associate (keyholder) and while I liked my job when I had to take off for a family emergency (my 4 month old granddaughter was on a ventilator and almost died!  She quit breathing and we almost lost her 3 times) my mgr was neither sympathetic or understanding!  She kept harassing me to the point that I quit!
good,Overall in charge of store. 60 to 80 hours a week expected. Payroll is consistently cut and the store manager has to fill the gap. Manager is expected to do as much as possible with no help. New managers do not receive performance bonuses for a year no matter how well store is performing.
good,This is a great job for a high school student that is looking for a part time job. But they need to help there employees out more so people can stay and help when needed and get raises
good,"I work for dollar General  twice. The first time I love my job, we had the best team ever I love them all!!!! This second time was not so great. I had to different manager in 6 month, my first manager wasn’t that bad she just didn’t know a lot and I had to teach her a lot, I didn’t have a problem with that at all. The second manager didn’t like that know more then her and tried to make me look bad and stop giving me hours, so had to  transfer to other store."
good,"Don't get me wrong I loved working for Dollar General I loved being able to serve customers and help them. Very rarely did I ever receive the horrible customer that you just could not satisfy, so on the customer standpoint it's not bad to work for. However I had a manager who had anger issues and constantly blamed everyone else for the way the store was instead of just sucking it up and moving on and fixing the problem.  this person would throw things out of anger and she was extremely rude to customers unless they were one of her favorites. I really don't think she took the time to train others coming in very well ,this manager just expected them to know what they were doing and I understand that the job was very stressful because this person had to work 60 + hours a week and only got paid for 48 but I was also right there beside them working just as hard and for up to the same amount of hours so no one else had to take the blows or the blame. I wanted to be the manager that people could come and talk to if they had a problem and I was told that I was the one that they would try to come out to if anybody had an issue. We would throw freight overnight so it wasn't as much work on us the next day. I liked her district manager he was very nice and understanding I like to the truck drivers that ended up delivering our loads however whoever works at the warehouse needs to learn how to stack they need to learn how to load a truck actually I think the warehouse just needs to read train all of their employees and when you scan your outs actually send what we scan not oh I only need"
good,Not interested  in saying  more. Why must it require it?  This is so stupid.  It was not the best place to work. But most of the people there were awesome to work with.
good,"At first, I really enjoyed my job and I moved up very quickly. Once I moved up to store manager there became entirely too much stress and unachievable expectations. the work-life balance is impossible on the hours and schedule they expect you to work. this job is good for someone who doesn't have children and a family."
good,I was a Key Holder. Loved it! Being bullied  by a new ASM was part of my job. I would have stayed but management needed to do better. Good work though.
good,"Typical day at work consists of making sure employees are completing task as well as making sure the cash handlers are taken care of and shelves are stocked. "
good,Good work place to build yourself. Great way to learn how to work as a team. Great customer service experience. Laid back environment. Over all a great place to work.
good,It was my favorite job I only quite bc I stayed to sick it was a great place to work my coworkers were awesome and very helpful for a newbie like me if I had to work there again I wouldn't mind at all
good,"Job good for kids starting out.  Also, for Temporary for looking for another job. Just do your work, and learn your manual-because the employee manual is very important so you know where you stand on issues."
good,"It's okay but we not working the 8hrs only 4 0r 5hrs a week,only 3 or 4 day"
good,The job was pretty easy and slow paced. You mostly run the cash register but also stock shelves and keep the stores clean and organized. But most of the stores in my area hire bad employees. They keep the isles cluttered with ladders and boxes full of store product that needs to be stocked on the shelves.
good,"If one were to work at the Dollar General that I worked at, then one would be overwhelmed all the time, placed in a hard situation, going back and forth constantly from register to stock and would be the only one who cleans."
good,Dollar general is an extremely difficult company to work for as they do not understand that your days of are those of your own. They also understand that you DO NOT have to come in when called.
good,I like it there but sometimes we the workers put in a lot an do not get appreciated for all the hard work we put in but I love what I do it pay the bills
good,I got that job just  to make ends meet. While i was there it was ok it was relaxed and slow paced at times but friendly people  to work with. It was quit mostly an ok place to work part or full time for.
good,The store manager rarely works. The employees work harder than they should. The store is a complete mess. The employees were the only good part about working.
good,"I do like working for dollar general,  but doesn't pay enough.  An I dont get much hours. I need a good paying job and more hours to support my family. And I just cant do it there."
good,i liked a few of my co workers but over all this place is not the best. the pay is not that great for the amount of work that is required. i really needed a job when i was there and happy to have gotten it
good,the good news its a growing company at over 1000 stores a year.  bad news is the labor model doesn't work at all.  expectations are unrealistic and there is no work/life balance.
good,"upper management will usually be down your throat about every single little thing and they will not be compassionate when you injure yourself. they will just ask, "" so why isnt this and that done?"" start way too low on associate staff and the turn over is high. they cut too many corners as a company to even wanna retire and they threaten job security to the entire district. it will cause panic attacks and they will just throw you in there."
good,"The store manager when I was hired was really great and understanding, gave me plenty of hours, etc. However, we soon received a new store manager who instantly cut my hours, and I wasn’t making near enough money to support myself. However, this was my first job in retail and I did learn a lot of great skills that have helped me at jobs after this one, and will continue to help me in the future."
good,"Pay is only minimum wage, no store discounts. 4 hour shifts once or twice a week. They offer 401k, maybe health insurance, but can't make enough money to get either. Otherwise, it's not a bad place to work"
good,"I was a Lead Sales Associate (3rd key holder). My manager didn't do his best to work with his employees. I was constantly doing a different job everyday. I would be stuck to work alone 2 hours a day all the while working truck, stocking, unloading totes, rearranging displays, checking in vendors, and cashiering."
good,"Personally I love the customer interaction, and my favorite part of the job is the stocking of freight. But, the lack of understanding of a single mothers responsibilities, has caused me to rethink my employment with this company. The management team at my location does not take into consideration the pressure the job puts on a single mother of two small children, and they require too much from someone who is a single mother. The management is faulty on the rules and regulations of the company, and the team is too focused on friendships and placing advancement opportunities for their acquaintances instead of those deserving of the positions."
good,Its a low level job and is not good for someone who has experience in other areas. There is nothing to work for and its mindless work. Recommend only older people with little to no education level or college students who don't need a lot of money.
good,"A typical day at work means long lines and fast going actions. You have to not only stock the shelves but also manage the register. I learned that being patient can help, the management was good. I enjoy working with pretty much everybody. The hardest part of my job is trying to do too many things at once. Imagine Walmart and all of their employees except you are doing everything. The most enjoyable part of my job is working in the day time because then I have time for myself later on."
good,I think the job itself wouldn't have been so bad for me if I had a different manager when I worked there. I was either overworked or was only on the schedule 2 days in a week. The manager made inappropriate comments about my miscarriage and had no regard for any of the employee's health. One girl had IBS and she refused to let her use the restroom. It was easy to be emotionally and mentally manipulated by her.
good,A typical day at Dollar General is stressful. The manager never stays for their shift and changes schedules at the last minute and doesn’t make it known. Employees hardly get to leave when their scheduled to get off because of the workload and scheduled hours.
good,"I had 3-4 different managers while working their all but one was horrible. They expect you to do everything with hardly any help or no help. You have to work register, stock, keep store clean."
good,I loved working at Dollar General until I took the Store manager position. Too much stress and no home/work life balance. I work 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week. The workload is overwhelming especially when you have unreliable employees.
good,I am grateful for the time I've spent with the company. It's been nice to learn new skills and I've enjoyed my time here. I feel as though it would be a better environment if they provided more labor to get things done
good,It’s all good at first but then it all goes down hill. ; well the one i work at. It’s okay. They just expect your life to revolve around it. And that’s not fair
good,Its good workplace. Most of the time it's slow. But then it goes fast paced. I don't like it because of the hours. So little hours and so little pay. Never liked it but and easy job to get. No benefits whatsoever.
good,nice customers and employees.no drama.had an amazing boss who cared and help me when i needed a day off.it was only full time so i didnt make much.its not a job to make a living off of.
good,The company gives you a set amount of hours a week to split between workers and it is never enough to finish all the tasks that need to be done in a week. They backroom is always to full and the isles get to blocked for the customer to get through.
good,"Dollar General is fine if you're just starting out in retail and want to learn a lot of stuff in a short time. You might get hired as a Sales Associate thinking all you'll be doing is running a cash register - wrong! You'll also be throwing freight, setting displays, straightening products on shelves, and any other of the seemingly endless tasks. Also, part-time employees get anywhere from 4 to (if you're lucky) 20 hours at barely above minimum wage (& no benefits other than a discount on store brands).  And you might be called in on your day off if someone calls out. Full-time employees are supposed to get at least 30 hours (yes - anyone getting at least 30 hours is considered full-time) but many of us don't. Depends on how much money corporate has decided your store can have that week for labor, which means Store Managers pull 40+ hours a week to make up for it (& they're salaried). Overtime for hourly is rare."
good,Never given enough hours for the amount we get paid. The schedule changes often. Dont get to request off any days. I'm never guaranteed a set full work schedule. One week I might get 20+ hours the next I might get 14.
good,"This is a decent place to work if you don’t mind sweating to death in the summer and constantly moving. I was unfortunate to work there in the summer and it would get so hot in there. I think it was good pay, especially for Indiana. You have to be quick and most of the time you have to stay over."
good,"Difficult retail management position.Very difficult to achieve success, I was successful...however but it was always glass half full. Never felt like it was good enough..whether it was increase in sales 20% or shrink number reduction.yes.."
good,"The store has nice employees and nice working environment, the store is clean and in order, the employees take time to help the customers and the shelves are always stocked"
good,"The assissant manager was really sweet and helpful. However, the manager didn't care about his employees safety, and didn't help to educate a new employee."
good,"This was a okay place to work, they always seemed to be understaffed which puts a lot of pressure on the employees that are loyal. Also there were many issues with the scheduling and conflict with other employees."
good,"My issue with DG was having to work alone in the stores if store budget hours were cut or if employees didn't show, called in, left early or shift ended."
good,My boss is amazing but the company as a whole has a lot of work to do to better suit their employees. They cut our payroll so much that none of us are able to get the hours we need to make it work there.
good,"I've worked at Dollar General for 6 years. I worked my way up from part time to lead key holder full time. The thing about working at my particular store is the more you worked and learned the more the management took advantage of you. "
good,Manager had a very smart mouth everyday. she always has plans so she cant work over and sometimes left early. Manager would never let you know if you were doing a good job but she would definitely chew you out if you did something wrong.
good,"I would clock in and count in my drawer, then throughout the day I would run back and forth between ringing up customers and stocking/facing the shelves. When it was time to close, the manager counted down the till and I cleaned as much as i could while the manager did their thing."
good,"It was just a everyday job. Cashiered, stocked, did freight, customer service, swept and moped the floors, kept the store nice, opened and closed...etc."
good,"the manager at the time was rude to employees and customers. he wasnt very helpful you had to kind of figure it out on your own, I was only there a few weeks and really disliked it."
good,Customers were great. The other associates were great to work with. I learned a lot working there. Some of the things I saw with the store manager weren't positive.
good,It is incredibly fast paced and doesn't grant a lot of benefits to compensate for the amount of workload you are required to do. The training wasn't quality enough to give you an idea of how difficult the job actually is.
good,"My overall experience with Dollar General was bad and somewhat good. I was Robbed once in the store and they never offered me any time off to seek councling. I returned to work the very next night. Then in management, they promote you but they also set you up for failure. They don't investigate things properly. They over work you for very little pay."
good,"The district managers do as little work as possible. They are hardly ever in their stores. When a new store manager has issues with existing employees the district manager will not back up the store manager and will instead take the existing employees side. They dont take the time to train properly, instead they throw their new store managers into the store and tell them to sink or swim until they have to go to a training class."
good,The manager was rude and not understanding. The employees constantly talked behind your back and were not friendly at all. I highly recommend not to work in the Jamestown PA dollar general.
good,I learned that retail management can be very challenging.  From the day to day expectations from DG Corporate with stocking and receiving core goods to policies needed followed for customer expectations the job was low pay for the volume of stress needed to effectively worked desired shifts.
good,I did gain some skills working here but most of the time no one was working hard like other employees and it was a struggle getting everything done while dealing with customers.
good,Its not a job for people who aren't willing to work or for someone who isn't ok with customer service. I had great people whom I worked with that made it more fun and worth my time. Being a manager is not easy and comes with a lot of responsibilities. I think I do great under pressure in customer service and I am good at keeping calm in tough or in what one would call hostile like situations with a customer.
good,"this job honestly was a waste of time . Don't get me wrong i enjoyed meeting all the new people, and building relationships. my problem was you couldnt get advanced working there. you'd have to move/ relocate to make it possible."
good,"-management was horrible except for at one place"
good,"Good starting job for teenagers. Pretty straight forward. Ring things up, take money, bag items, repeat. Stock shelves and mop floors, go home etc. Not the greatest pay but not the worst."
good,"It’s an okay job. Some customers are extremely nice, some are rude. The management needs help. Sometimes you will not get your hours. Okay benefit package."
good,"I always enjoyed going to work at "
good,"When it was managed by Lakeitha, it felt like family and home. There was nothing but teamwork. However, our store and Fayette, MS are overlooked by DMs and GMs because they are located in the rural areas. The executive refuses to produce more working hours but ships freight to the stores without reviewing the inventorying."
good,"A typical day at work was running register, putting out stock or setting planograms; helping cashiers with refunds, etc.. Also, made nightly deposits."
good,I feel they could raise there pay and give more hours if they want keep people they can't keep workers they only give the workers two to three days a week no one can live off that low pay
good,"When I was first brought in, the manager on duty that I was paired with didn't really train me. I had to learn how to operate the cash register myself and I ended up short in my drawer. I had to be retrained. Now I don't earn enough to keep myself afloat. They give all the work hours to managers or new cashiers."
good,The management was very poor and disorganized. I was assured that when I came back from maternity leave I would still have a job. When I put in the notice that I was coming back to work I was told I was replaced and I no longer had a job.
good,The job itself is hard work. its simple and fast. The management never tell the truth. coworkers are easy to get along with. pay should be much higher.
good,"My manager is absolutely terrible, hence why I am searching for a new job. She babies some workers, calls workers in so she can leave early, doesn't train any of the new employees and generally sits in the back on her phone or spends the rest of her time flirting with the delivery truck drivers. Multiple co-workers feel the same and are planning on leaving. I have never disliked working, but here I do."
good,I do give them a 5 to 6 out of 10 to work for. There's not many hours for cashier's alone as this is a corporate place and depends on the amount of money that you have made every month as to whether corporate allows you more cashiers or raises
good,Not appreciated. Your just another body and seen as easily replacable.  You are expected to work many hours to cover your store and don't get support from dms.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would be cashing out customers, stocking and cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the customers and working with the employees."
good,The job was good for someone looking to make a little extra cash. There are no benefits or bonuses. The hours are inconsistent and is the management. Not for someone trying to support a family
good,Overall.. My experience with the company was ok.. The employees were great! Besides the odd balls.. Also i got the experience to be Acting Store Manager for 2 wks. which was an absolute fun but overwhelming experience!
good,"My job is very stressful, love what I do but it is very stressful, you have to be able to multitask with dollar general, our hours are never the same and neither is our off days, you have to be available 7 days a week so I can't get a second job, this job does not pay well and raises are not good that is even if you get one they expect you to do 10 plus job for one pay."
good,"Worked the evening shift, usually 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Most times 4 days a week. Stocked shelves and rotated product if necessary. Helped customers check out by being on the register and assisting them in finding items on shelves."
good,"Do your research look it up on Google before applying , may be easy to get in but one of the worst companies alongside family dollar, constantly run off a skeleton crew. Realistically speaking its a decent job but there's better out there, personally its a 3/5. Would work for them again, if no one else"
good,"I would have to stock merchandise, organize, set up plano grams and"
good,Not enough people works at one time so your work is hard to get done sometimes. The pay is not good. People expect all your time but don’t want to give you the same in return. The hours are lousy.
good,Quick paced environment. Pay could've been better for the work that was being done. No benefits unless you are high up in management. Customer services was always key
good,"almost impossible to move up, you get written up for dumb little things and it effects your chances of getting another position. they are not very lenient at all."
good,Working for Dollar general is okay. The manager i had was not professional at all. She was rude and treated us employees like dogs. I enjoyed the work at dollar general.
good,"Dollar General is very under paying they dont send help until the place completely falls apart and on top of that my store is one of the busiest in the district, it took my store manager,the assistant manager, and the full time key quitting for my store to get help and then when im on verge of quitting they give me a raise to try and bribe me to stay"
good,"Stayed with this company because I saw room for growth with them, but eventually learned that this company doesn't want to expand. They are a company very ""set in their ways""."
good,"I really do not like doing this. It was fast paced, fellow employees were good to work with.Why are you so determined to get my ideas on how this co was to work for?"
good,"If you run a busy store, and the oil patch is booming, you're in for a rough time. It's hard to compete with oilfield wages, so staffing is always an issue. As a salaried manager, your take-home pay won't be worth the hours you put in trying to keep your store afloat. "
good,"I was robbed,threatened,held at gunpoint,had to break up fights,was called the N-word by customers and peers.Some manager try to bend rules in their favor and take advantage of a employees ignorance.A dollar general employee is security,IT,and sales associate.You are expected to guard merchandise if your in a area with a slow police response time you might as well just turn blind eye to thieves because its not worth your time,energy,or life.Ive seen men customers push down women while trying to escape and the entire staff can only stand by and call the cops who can do little to nothing in these events.I was once robbed at gunpoint and the criminal is still on the loose because of masks and gloves.The job is unsafe but in a good area can be worth it."
good,Manager was terrible and refused to listen to anything and constantly  defended employees who did not do their jobs. Therefore making it harder to do my job and more work on everyone.
good,"At first I believe that Dollar General was pretty simple job that anyone can do it. When I got promoted after three weeks of hiring, I thought being a sales lead is much better than a sales associate. Honestly, I was wrong after two months of sales lead. Too much responsibilities and most of the time, the lead get the blame unfairly and not the associate. Benefits of leads are more hours and more pay but in the end not worth it for the long run."
good,"I got between 8 to 20 hours a week and it isn't enough to live off of this would be great for a college student, or a retiree or anyone who needs a little extra cash"
good,"I started at 7am get money to get change for the day,checked last nights sales,8.00banks drive threw is open ,go to bank to get change,come back open store not budged enough hour ,I work alone until10.am cashier comes in,I  do my order put out stock,work schedule write off damages,help on sales floor.when truck comes help unload truck,take stock to sales floor put up stock,shift change,take off regester count money ,make up deposit ,take to bank"
good,Going into Dollar General a lot of people don't realize the vast amount of work to do with very little budget. Theres little to no praise given for a job well done. The raises are not competitive at all.
good,When I was working there I wasn't getting many hours so I wasn't getting much money. But I learned a lot like how to work with people with attuides and custmers.
good,"I went in with a good attitude but would leave with a bad attitude. I worked at 4 different dollar general got me down in the dumps, if it wasn't the workers it was the customers, and if not the customers then it was being overwhelmed by work."
good,"I loved my co workers, hated management. They never showed up when needed to, the place was ran as a free for all when it came to rules. Some people got away with one thing but others fired for same thing or less. Turn over rate is crazy, so many people in and out for quitting or getting fired."
good,Though my time at dollar general was short it was a great experienced. Although it’s not what I was looking for it gave me some much needed skills to advance in my career building.
good,"Dg is extremely stressful, pay is not appropriate for the responsibility forced upon head manager. Zero training even though policy states otherwise. Not enough hours given to the store to appropriately schedule staff. DM is unimformative and to rigid with HIS rules."
good,Everything seem to be alalright. Could of been giving extra hrs more. But besides figuring were everything at without labels. It was alright place to start some were to learning on having good people skills.
good,"Assisting, greeting and taken care of customers was one of the most important and exciting part of my day. Also, assisting my co-workers in all areas."
good,"I enjoyed working with the Store Manager herself and most of my coworkers but they do not offer any type of Full Time unless you are an assistant store manager or manager at least. The new District Manager assigned to our store informed my immediate boss that she could no longer work around my school schedule and that I had to be available all shifts, which is why I quit. Unless you plan to go into management, which can take forever, I would simply consider this a temp job."
good,"Company has every day mapped out for the staff, which works really well if you adhere to it faithfully. Gives you the ability to manage your staff and time to get other things done. Managers tend to not be able to find good reliable staff and end up spending a lot of hours in their stores. Doesn't make for good work/life balance."
good,Just as the title says...overworked and underpaid with lack of assistance. Two employees per shift does not cut it in the real world. High volume of theft.
good,It really is a cool job if you are looking for a steady income. It is a really steady paced job and if you do your job right you'll slowly get hours. The customers are friendly and most are regulars.
good,Easy job with nice customers but job environment was stressful. District manager was abusive to store manager and did not interact with any regular employees.
good,Great people poor management  I had sergury then got laid off because of mean manager the place is nice the customers are great the prices are good no overtime
good,the biggest downfall was the fact that some parts of the Management team was improperly trained. my other co-workers were very easy to get along with. The pay wasnt the best but i really enjoyed my job.
good,Very little pay and not enough hours. Fun work OMACs but not willing to pay enough to keep employees. I would not recommend for single parent trying to make it
good,My experience is different than others so I'm not going to say anything .if there's nothing good I have to say while working here then I'm staying quiet.
good,"It was a good learning experience overall, a chance to learn retail experience and several equiment oprations. A place that doesn’t give an opportunity to grow."
good,it was a okay place to work the management was rude and they didnt care you dont get enough hours it was alaways hot in there they didnt have the air on
good,"It may have been just the environment of that particular store, but I hated going to work. It drained me. I never looked forward to it. I thrive in a positive work environment. This one was not."
good,The management was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with positive customers and making their day more enjoyable.
good,the management from a new manager was horrible. he treated me like trash and like I didn't wanna work there. I took one day off to babysit my siblings and he treated me like I should just quit the job.
good,Working for Dollar General was great at first. Became very uncomfortable when the lack of employees were being hired & store became over whelming to keep up. Lack of security when closing every night.
good,"During my time with the company I felt my work ethic was noticed and appreciated most of the time. The work was overall simply and they usually didn't have high expectations, My biggest concern was the lack of benefits and low wages for their employees."
good,"Good job for people wanting to get management experience."
good,The job is amazing. The customers who are regulars almost become like family. At my particular location the manager is very petty and will hold things against employees and threaten their job status in order to get them to work harder.
good,"Although I like working at my Dollar General store specifically, our District Manager is highly unprofessional and is always making ridiculous rules such as no paper plates and such in the break room and can't sell items to fellow employees during their shift without putting your initial on the receipt and all items. I feel like the company does not trust us and tries to get as much out of us as they can. They will do whatever it takes to make sure no one goes into overtime and avoiding giving anyone full time."
good,This position allowed me to get my foot in the door for management. The job was stressful at times with finding potential help within the store such as team members. The position always has projects needing to be completed.
good,Decent place to work for. Managment can be a little self centered. Direct manager at the store i worked out would no go above and beyond. She said she didnt get paid for it
good,Store manager was very reasonable and flexible. Upper management for store very unprofessional and demanding. Customers very unruly and stole multiple times a day. More theft I've seen in years.
good,"Just your typical Retail job. Just like any job it has its ups and downs. Very busy job. If you do not like to assist people, this is not the job for you."
good,Work environment was ok. The pay was horrible and lots of inconsistency in the schedule they would always want to hire new people instead of giving more hours to the workers they already had.
good,As I started working there I notice that a lot of workers was lazy and didn't like doing the cashier part of the job all they wanted to do was stock the store. The first three weeks I work Monday-Sunday and closed and I was still in school during this time so it was to much. I think it should have better management.
good,"I'm not going to speak on all Dollar Generals but' the one I've worked at had poor management, the hours jumped all over the place and the pay for the job work  was unfairly low. It is a good first job but i would not recommend it for a ladder job."
good,"It was a nice place to work. My only problem was that I was supposed to stock the shelves while I was there, but that was almost impossible with only me, and a manager there. Actually, both of us were supposed to be stocking the shelves, but I had to stay behind the counter 90% of the time to deal with customers while the manager was stocking shelves, and doing managerial things. What was annoying is that if I was overwhelmed with customers, I had to use the pager on a cordless phone to alert the manger, they had the phone itself, to come to the counter to help."
good,"The company requires a lot of physical labor from the management team. The hours are brutal. You often have to cover shifts to trim payroll hours and since you are salary there is no compensation for that time. However, overall the customers are pleasant, management is competent and supportive."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with the customers. I did not like standing on my feet all day, or working all weekends. Depending on the other people working with you, it may be a good experience or not so good. just like all jobs."
good,For the most part working there was ok. There is work to do and no time to do it. A lot of turnover at the stores. They never give the managers enough payroll for the staff to do their jobs as in stocking.
good,Dollar General was a great job for someone without children. They did alot of calling me into work when sometimes it was hard for me to come in. But my overall experience was in between good a bad
good,"This company wants to grow faster than it trains it's employees, "
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful. "
good,enjoyed job and interacting with customers- Retail has been my whole life.Couldnt go any furthur for you would have to relocate.I liked seening the same customers everyday
good,Dollar general let me to believe that this job can be simple if you follow their 7 day work flow.  What they fail to say is they don't give payroll to complete these task.  Store manager must work over scheduled hours to make sure to cover the hours that they don't give you.
good,"Hours are long, benefits are very poor, environment is highly stressful, extremely fast paced and absolutely no down time.  I have worked for this company since 2010.  A lot has changed in the last 8 years.  Less payroll to go around and more work expected.  There are not enough hours in a day to get all that needs to get done in a work day."
good,Hours were very inconsistent very a set schedule. Stressful workplace sometimes. Had to help clean the whole store before the end of the day. Customers were rude and disrespectful sometimes and the store would be a complete mess.
good,Good place but couldn't keep a manager and no cashiers that was reliable I did enjoy serving the customers and making sure they got the best service entering and exiting the store
good,"Opened the store. Walk the floor making sure thing were in order., anything from stocking, fronting and blocking, and housekeeping. Engaged with customers and employees."
good,"Typical day was running cash register and stocking."
good,It’s a great starter job but I wouldn’t recommend staying there full term. Pay rates are different for everyone so someone who’s in the same position as you could get paid better or worse.
good,"As my first management position, it was a great experience. I enjoyed doing so many different jobs in one position. I appreciated the challenge and lead me to more management position."
good,"Great company to work for as far as compensation and benefits, but the work culture is not where I thought it should be for such a successful company. Customers are not the companies #1 priority in my opinion. They could do so much more to enhance the customer experience but they honestly choose to focus on working as comfortably as possible regardless of store conditions. Upper management is rather rediculous and drama filled. Very gossipy and ""clickish"". Company policies can be broken by one who were subservant towards upper management. Not a fair playing field for one who plays by the book."
good,"This company is very laid back and easy going, with a few minor setbacks, high turnover rate, and unbalanced hours, shifts are randomized but the job security is solid. Management is patient and understanding, and customers are friendly and generally consider the store their neighborhood store. Theft is high there is little to no time for job culture to be implemented but over all the pay is fair and job security is stable."
good,"Usually only 2 employees on the job at a time. There are many stores that require more due to sales, stocking, ability to deter theft to name a few. Dollar General is very unforgiving. I understand a policy is a policy but so many good people and workers lose their jobs for 1 mistake, Does't matter what the circumstance is."
good,"I love working at Dollar General. I am a very organized person so i I get to go to work where I can organize things and get paid for it, along with providing excellent customer service, then that job is perfect for me."
good,It was great working with my friend but with the change of management it wasn't a good place to work. If you did 1 thing wrong you aren't scheduled for a week.
good,Corporate does not place enough value on their employees. Or on their managers . Most stores are overstocjed with merchandise and no space to locate it ..so therefore it ends up looking cluttered .
good,People there were nice and helpful. Pay was low and raises don't come often.  Benefits not offered unless you are the main manager of the store. Quick learning environment.
good,Dollar General is a great company for someone looking to get minimal work experience and gain skills but I wouldn't recommend it to be a long-term job opportunity if you're just working in retail.
good,I was held at gunpoint while all Managment was in the back having some kind of party for an employee. Management was all family so they were always with each other. After the robbery I ended up on meds & in therapy & they were going to fire me but did I had the option to quit so I did
good,"A day started off as taking control of the store from the leaving manager and then doing my duties. The store manager buckled under the pressure of upper management and took it out on the lower managers, ruining the experience of a fun workplace."
good,Most of the time I was the one doing EVERYTHING. I had little help and the manager had been out for 6 months when I was hired. The place was filthy and very unorganized. I am sure other dollars aren't half as bad as the one I was at though.
good,I was not entirely fulfilled with my experience with Dollar General. If I was offered more hours I might have stayed. Being called in at a drop  of a hat was not good due to my having to find a babysitter at short notice.
good,"Waiting on customers, run register, facing stock on shelves nd cleaning the store at closing. Enjoyed waiting on customers and working. The manager I worked under was nice."
good,I am not a lazy person and have excellent work ethic. This company just doesn't  do thing right. I mean maybe they have good argument but in my opinion they are under staffed and under paid for the amount of expectations
good,You will spend hours upon hours putting stock on the shelves and get told continuously to speed things up with unreasonable time constraints per shipment of stock. You will feel like nothing ever gets accomplished unless higher management in scheduled to tour the store.
good,made you work 50+ hours a week only getting paid for 40 hours and nothing was still ever good enough... the higher chain bosses are very rude and disrespectful.
good,Its an OK place to work to get some experience or if you are a college student. The pay is not at the levels it should be compared to other jobs in the same category.
good,If you ate looking for a part time job its perfect. But as far as an only job to pay your bills with its not worth it. Not enough hours and the hours very so much that you are unable to make plans for a week . You will close one day to wake up and open the next.
good,I was not payed well. It was an easy job with little expectations other than showing up on time and taking meals at correct time. The store was dirty. I left because I was not getting enough hours and the assistant manager was hard to work for she had the personality of a houseplant. My favorite part of the job was stocking shelves and staying busy.
good,typical day at dollar general the morning would be spent restocking shelves and putting delivery trucks away the rest of the day would be cashing out customer purchases cleaning and refreshing stock as needed.
good,I recommend working for this company for young adults. It was light and easy work but no room for advancement. Our store was in a small community so not real busy.
good,"with the right manager this retailer would be better to work for, also they need to up their compensation because so much is expected of the daily management staff, while the GM is the one being compensated for others work. You do meet some nice customers and they appreciate your hard work but the company does not value their employees, in turn making the company's turn over rate very high."
good,More than is physically possible is expected and i understand that i wasn't a manager at the time but being lied to is never expected. It could just be the location i was at but with the experience i had i would not recommend working here.
good,dont want to give it and feel that this isn't really necessary. If a job is needed then by all means apply some can handle the stress and will work any job for an income.
good,The job itself is ok. The manager I had was terrible. He hated everyone and had a potty mouth. They work days were inconsistent. I am a college student who lived on campus and wasn't able to stay in town during holidays. He made me demote myself because of it.
good,"Meeting new people, overall pretty laid back job. Typical  days doing general cleaning and tending to the customers. I just enjoyed going to work that was my highlight of my day."
good,I did Enjoy working at the dollar general but it does need  better management and employees should be able to get more hours if needed. The job itself is pretty easy though
good,"I worked as a store manager for 2 years, worked my way up to that position. It was stressful. Every year we had hours cut which forced us in the stores more. The turn over rate is awful but that’s the same with retail all over. They hand you way too much for one weeks worth of work and not enough hours. The pay is decent, but you won’t have a home life. They don’t take care of their employees and it’s family oriented for the customers not the employees. That’s all you are to them.  A worker."
good,its a job you have when you are young and need some money. Paid weekly but only making minimum wage. It also may depend on the neighbor hood you decide to work in.
good,If you want a job that makes you feel like you accomplished something that day. This isn't the job for you. I always felt as if I was running in a circle until I went home.
good,"Poor Management"
good,"This job is okay to earn a little bit of extra cash, but not when it comes to advancing in the field. Management was also bad about talking poorly of their crew, but doing nothing to fix problems (e.g., write ups, cutting hours, firing, or correcting employees). Management was also bad about cutting hours of employees they no longer wanted to ""deal with"" in order to get them to quit, and never explained things to them. Just took them off the schedule with no explanation."
good,"Working at Dollar General is quick paced, and a lot of hard work. My job included keeping an eye on the register while packing shelves and cleaning while guiding customers as well. It's a minimum wage job."
good,"Hours were always being cut back even when we were seriously short handed and needed to get the store ready for inventory. Needed professional,hardworking, reliable, and dependable employees which were in very short supply."
good,"I've worked at many different dollar general stores and have been the store manager of one of them. I really liked the job for a while and promotions come pretty easily. However, the workload is too much in management positions. No work life balance."
good,Its a very friendly work environment depending who you work with and how you present yourself. It is also kind of hard to handle if you are not to good with socializing or handling difficult customers.
good,its a great place for someone who needs a job where you do not get many hours. Taking days off is also not very easy. Its a great place for someone who is right out of high school looking for their first job. It was easy to move up to assistant manager but that is about as high as you can go unless you know someone higher up.
good,Don't bother unless if you can get $14 per hour out of it and less of a work load. Love working with the people around me and dealing with the customers but outside of that that is it.
good,they expected cashiers to do wayyy too  much  for the little bit of money. hardest part was putting up with the bs from managers and everything was short notice
good,"It's a good part time, or second job, but not great for a main job.  The pay is very low if you aren't a keyholder or a manager, and they are always understaffed in larger stores so it can lead to a stressful amount of work for one person.  There's no employee discount, but they do offer a lot of sales and coupons."
good,Very inconsistent with their choice of management. They don't properly investigate when misfortunes happen. Depending on what area you work in you will run into frequent robberies whether minor stealing or at gunpoint. It's happened to me twice.
good,"generally open and prep the store check out customer and run front of the store freight. I have learned to manage time and people, to be more consistent and patient than i already am. the management is difficult when you dont have a sufficient staff, and must compensate for those insufficiency's . the workplace culture is overall good when everyone has an upbeat attitude and the right outlook on the job. The hardest part of the job is to deal with unruly customers and refuse to hear reason. the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with great customers and working in groups."
good,"Stressful do to lack of employee and upper corporate knowing and working in the stores themselves to know what we really go through on a day to day basis in there metro stores,with employees,theft and sometimes dangerous situations"
good,"The workplace is pretty busy as often, plus sometimes the customer's children makes a mess to the shelves but I don't blame them their just kids. I learned pretty much about stocking there from my boss, but the hardest part of the job is pulling out things from the shelves that don't belong there and finding where it goes."
good,My typical day at work was simple. I honestly recommend it for a first time job. You get plenty of experience working at the Dollar General Corporations. I'm more than satisfied with the experience I had while working for Dollar General.
good,A typical day at work goes by fast because you are constantly busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping and satisfying the customers. Management is always there to help.  The workplace is friendly and there is nothing really hard about working there.
good,"A typical day would consist of getting there before my shift started, making sure my drawer was good to go, and either help stock shelves or take over the cashier. The management was bad. She was a new manager and changed the schedule often, without notifying the employees. If they missed a day because of that, she also would not try to contact them and tell them that they need to be working. That was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was seeing a lot of the familiar faces."
good,"If you need a first job, or a first management job, DG could work out for you.  But I would recommend getting the experience and and moving on to a better paying position elsewhere."
good,It was an okay job for the time being. The customers were nice and friendly. The employees were fairly good as well. Probably wouldn't work there again though.
good,"This was a stressful place to work with everyone trying to tell you the ""correct way"" to do things.  The actual manager was rarely ever there when I worked there. You are expected to put away trucks and be able to keep your customers happy. You are required to take your breaks at certain times even if the other cashier is busy."
good,When I was hired it was part time and every other weekend I started as a cashier then became key holder first manger was great one that took over did not understand my schedule or training
good,been working at dg a year and 3 months and its okay if you are looking for something part-time but part-timers get no benifits whatsoever and the hours could be a little better
good,Dollar general was a good company to work for but I had to relocate back to my hometown an that I I was offered a job with my current company management could have been better .
good,"Being let go because my child was ill and in the hospital."
good,A typical day at work was always basic. Their was always a routine. Everything was straight forward. I learned to multitask well. The management wasn't that great.
good,"Typical day at DG varies. It depends on what day it is and what vendors you have coming it. It also depends on what season it is. "
good,I have been with them for 5 years it's stressful but can be fun. Nice place to work. Always room for advancement. There are great people that work for this company
good,"The job and people were great, the manager is the only reason that I left. Poor management skills and childish behavior, along with other things, but overall the job was good, if you can handle the management."
good,Running cash register. Stocking shelves. Cleaning floors /shelves. Relocate item to different area of store. Helping customers. Moving product inside and out. Setting up special items
good,"to stock shelves, run register ,clean  area during my time of employment at the Darien location we were not busy most days so got to go home early. as far as the security we had none and had to watch the ones who were stealing but you were not allowed to follow them out if they made it out the store. it was company policy for your safety"
good,I was part time due to having another job. there was always an issue. the management was/is not very good. I learned a lot about the business. They need to work on the confidentiality.
good,"As a store mgr you are expected to do most of the work as they are stingy on labor budget."
good,I enjoyed my time with dollar general but I found employment opportunities somewhere else that allowed me to provide for my family better. The work life balance was rough at times working 7 days a week with no off time and 12-14 hours a day if not longer.
good,fast paced environment where always meet new and friendly customers. small town location made it fun and easy to get personal and close to customers made every day at work more outgoing and easy to deal with every day activities.
good,this job will give you good experience working with the public. You will also learn alot when it comes to time management as well as patience. Great first time job or a summer job.
good,Work overall wasn't hard or overbearing. The staff was easy to get along with. Due to poor management i lost a job for not having new time sheets out.
good,"On a regular day I would stock but run the cash register at the same time. If we so happen to get done before closing, we would organize and fix shelves until then."
good,"Enjoy working for this company,  very pleasant and clean environment. Associates  are very professional and friendly. Training videos were very helpful,  enjoy helping customers."
good,Customer were great got use to the regular customers. There was never a dull moment but I think  dollar general works their employees too hard. Under staffed
good,"I like working there it was to much h said she said. managers wanted you to lie. I didn't work to many hours, but my days ( every day I had off ) they were calling me in. I the pay was not worth all of that."
good,"I enjoyed the employees that I worked with. It is a good company to start off with. It was really hard to get the management team to be on the same page with everyone. It seemed to have a lot of tension between them. I was able to advance within the company quickly, but again, there were so many changes with management that it was very hard to obtain a sense of stability."
good,I liked my job but when it come to me getting really sick to the point I couldn't work do to my illness the store manger still wanted me to work and because of that I quite before I was supposed to be there and she put it in the system as I walked out on a shift when I didnt
good,There's too much to do in too little time. A typical day at work you come in to get yelled at. Then told to do the impossible. The most enjoyable part of job is the part when you go home.
good,"Mostly alone, fast pace (at times) , manager doesn't seem to be as qualified, friendly co-workers, hardest part would be being the only cashier, enjoyable part is making a connection with customers."
good,"It was a laid back environment.I got along with everyone I worked around,and my boss was really nice and helped me they alot.she taught me alot too while I was there.it was a friendly place to work.it was an easy laid back job to due"
good,"I worked there so long it felt like. Its a company you can move up in. And most mangers are very nice and easy to work for,but for me I didn't get that lucky."
good,This is a great company to work for short term but they treat management terribly and take you for granted. Advancement is easy and benefits are great.
good,"A typical day requires you to be acrobatic, in flexibility.   I took on a store that was buried under 4 trucks of freight, with a hostile staff.  Within the first 40 days I was awarded a small bonus, as I was already turning the store around. Hiring adequate employees, maintaining hours, managing the proper work of freight and most importantly, rebuilding our rapport with the customers in this store. The customer service had been severely damaged and now, they were seeing a new face to the store with new smiling people ready to greet them and help them.  "
good,As with any job it's about who you work with. If others aren't doing their jobs then it's hard for you to do yours. The pay wasn't all that great and in my position there was no advancement opportunities.
good,"working in dollar general is a good chance to gain experience. however, there is little room for moving up in the company and the pay and hours are not great."
good,I loved this job but the environment wasn't healthy and they didn't work with you. It was always what the manager needed to do first. I have a family and was never able to spend time with them due to this job
good,It all depends. Every store is not the same like dont have the same managers or hours available. Each store is different. Overall I've had to stock and finish truck when it got to the store. Help customers and my team members when needed. Hours where great 20-35 hours a week. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"On truck days your really busy trying to unload truck and help with customers , on the good note you find out about sales before everyone  and get them first."
good,"It's a decent job if you are trying to get your resume built, would not recommend for a career unless you have no other options. This company is pretty decent with hours if you are in management but not so much for rank-and-file employees. With some exceptions in some stores, the company requires you to be 18 or older. It's only slightly better than Dollar Tree and Wal-Mart."
good,"Be prepared to work hard and not be appreciated for it.  They manage by fear and threaten to fire you constantly.  They use write-up's to communicate.  You might get lucky and work for a good manager, but most are not qualified."
good,I was a sales associate and really enjoyed working for the company until they made it to where cashiers and key holders could only be hired as part time. In doing so they took away all opportunity for any kind of benefits.
good,"Company is 100% about Customer Service. That is their main goal ; to please and take care of their customers. But they are cheap. As in won't take care of their buildings when they are falling apart, or their employees. It's cheaper for them to let a building rot and build a new one down the road, then fix the problems they already have. Same with employees. It's easier for them to fire and re-hire then it is to properly train the employees they already have. But that's why they are able to bring their customers such low prices."
good,"To put it bluntly, Dollar General expects a great deal of loyalty and physically rigorous work without offering much in the way of compensation. I would not recommend this job for anyone seeking a dependable, livable wage. Even as a manager there it was a struggle, and the needs of the company were vast."
good,"Upper District Management says that they have an open door policy but that just simply isn't true! Higher upper management is allowed to bring issues to work and blame you for them but you are not allowed to. Needs better management instead of hateful people. Store management, at least at my store, is so much better."
good,"Moved up in a short period of time but pay was terrible, even as a member of management. Enjoyed the work. Store management when I left was terrible. Ended up leaving on short notice due to issue with another employee."
good,A lot of the same tasks to be done everyday. Always putting back items that have been shoved off the shelves and checking out customers in the front. Worked nights mostly and always seemed to be understaffed. Always overstocked on many items. Friendly co-workers made the job more enjoyable.
good,"Didn't have enough people to work on shipment days. The store was unorganized, and I do believe at the time the store didn't even have a store manager. Enjoyed working with other employees and for the community. Store had a lot of potential."
good,Nice people good 1st job however I believe the work compared to pay is a little unfair compared to other jobs with similar pay. On top there's no real benefits of working besides gaining experience in customer service.
good,"Typical day in DG includes running the cash register, stocking, and recovering when you aren't ringing someone up. You're overworked for the low wage. MNgement only cares about customers and not employees. Some nice  to live at this place!"
good,"This place is ok as a part time job but if you are looking for advancement this is not the company to work for. The management also really sucks, they have no idea the amount of work we need to get stuff done."
good,Corporation doesn't provide proper tools for management to effectively run stores this in turn makes employment for everyone difficult and more stressful than it needs to be.
good,"Even though my work experience was short at this store, the previous management the store was under was very unpredictable in behavior and unorganized. I pray that the new management has the store in better array."
good,While I worked for dollar Gen it was slow paced until about closing then it was busy I didn't get the hours that I needed or wanted I was not informed about meeting while on my days off
good,"The more you know, the more you'll hate this place.  The job itself isnt all that bad, depending on the store your at, but use your own best judgements on it.  Be sure to go and shop at the store a few times before thinking of applying to it."
good,"This job depends on the store manager and district manager if the manager is trained and does there job well and they work with the crew it's good. If they have the support of the dm it's better if not it isn't good."
good,I liked the interaction with the customers but management seemed one sided if there was a problem and didnt want to really losten if you are new. Seemed to want to put all task unwanted on the new people as well...
good,was pass to do thing I did not went to do and only getting 17 hours a week and did not give me a lunch brake most of the time and was pressure to for get procedure.
good,"Manager experience was not pleasant the manage at this job location was rude and disrespectful, as a cashier i had to do everything it was a stressful job having to run cashier i as well had to recover the shelfs,stock,and gather carts from outside.  sweep, mop and clean windows"
good,this job wasn't for me they are not a comp that I would work for again .They need help they manger and the way they teach and act and the pay wasn't good
good,I enjoyed working with others and meeting new ppl. Just didnt sign a note when they was writing me up for someone else doings. I didnt do no wrong to been fired
good,"The customers are nice, you build a relationship. Management and company itself could improve. The store requires a lot with little pay. The company could give incentives for better performance from workers."
good,When i was 18 this was the first paid job i had as an adult. I think that this was a good job to start at but when i worked there it was very stressful.
good,"A day at the store was hectic, sometimes hard to complete due to the management desk was cluttered and hard to find paperwork that was need and the files and cabinets were poorly labeled.The hardest part of the job was finding out only one day before if you worked or not due to the schedule not being posted till the day before sometimes the day of. I loved my customers they were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Flexible hours, great customer service experience, excellent advancement opportunities.  Work with great staff. Decent size with a Small general store atmosphere."
good,It's a good job to start at but I feel it don't allow you to grow as much and thats what is pushing me to find another job. But as long as you do you me job you should do fine
good,"They expect you to be able to do everything. They would want you to run the front cash register, take care of customers and stock everything all at once. Several of us have suggested putting a bell at the register so the customer is not waiting long and we were told no because it was our responsiblity to watch the front and arrive to the register fast. They considered having the bell there being rude to the customer. And they expect us to do all this with barely paying us at all"
good,"Mostly stocking and cashier work but be prepared to be run like a dog, from the time you get there til the time you leave. This store stays busy with the locals but not all of them are kind."
good,"Company really depends on who is above you. I had an awesome manager who made the work at the store level extremely satisfying, but not the same experience with district managers. Often times, upper-management doesn't care about you and kills in positive culture the company could have. No real incentives to work there honestly."
good,It was ok.had very different people the management was very organized at times people called off to many times with nothing happing to them was very stressful
good,"This job was a good job to have while going to school. The store manager that I had worked around my schedule and always had a positive attitude. I moved up in the company quickly and I loved what I did. The only negative thing is that we received way too much product for our store. Instead of waiting for the product to be sold, so we would have more room on our shelves, the company forced us to cram all of the product on the floor. Our store became unorganized and it created a negative work space."
good,Not for employees.assigned unattainable task. needes better trained managers.it would be nice to be appreciated for the things that are done right not just to be told what you do wrong all the time.
good,It was a ok job .it is a good job for a teenager who love to be in retail and teach them how to communicate with others. I met a lot of people from different states and different town.
good,"I will not say the company Dollar general itself is terrible , but the location I was placed was . Lack of professionalism & management"
good,"Open and close store, pace is non stop, insurance was unaffordable, constant change and remodeling. was not trained, just thrown into a store and expected to succeed."
good,I worked here and it wasnt the best. when i first started working there I barely got any hours but some how I was working every single weekend and closing every single time I worked. They told me you cannot be a full time employee unless you are a manager or keyholder. it just wsnt right.
good,"Dollar General was actually one of the most enjoyable of my lower paying jobs. The hours were okay, the management was okay, and the job duties were simple, the pay wasn't great though."
good,Hours each week vary for sales associates and that makes planning for bills tough ! Different manager needed. Need more hours for every store.
good,I feel as Dollar General Distribution could be better ran. Most of the supervisors don't want to help with setting career advancement goals as we are told that they will do to help you move up. Most of the supervisors don not know their job well enough to be functional.
good,I worked for Dollar General for three years. I worked in a Dollar General Market which combines a typical store with grocery. The work itself is not difficult. It is repetitive in nature. I am female and found it difficult to move up into store managrment even though I had proven myself and had experience. The schedules were supposed to be made out to weeks in advance but never were. I spent more time away from my family than I ever had  since working in retail. The pay was also the worst In had ever encountered.
good,I worked here for only a year or so. We went through 3 managers and I didn't get paid for 3 weeks straight and ended up leaving because hey had no clue what was going on.
good,"Typical day is busy from the time you walk in, until time to leave.  Hard physical labor. Not many hours for part time workers."
good,"a typical day was hetic, i learned alot, management sucked, co workers decent, and lazy trying to get someone to teach you what to do. meeting the customers."
good,"This location is, at times, a fast paced place to work. However, it seems to be more suited for the non career employee, not for someone who is looking for long term (career) employment. I base this on the lack of benefits, pay scale, Etc. It is a great place to learn retail work such as customer service."
good,"I worked at a Dollar General in NY for months, and I ended up being promoted to a part time keyholder. It started out pretty well. However, my manager would put me on for over 30 hours, sometimes over 40 hours a week. Worse still, I would almost always be the only one at the register, which would lead to long lines and irritated customers. He could be difficult to work with sometimes during rushes and was very rude to customers. Keyholders and cashiers were quitting almost every other week because of him, so we were constantly getting new employees with non-flexible hours.This would lead to frequent phone calls during my days off, which revolved around my set schedule. The DM would be very unhappy with the conditions of the store and his work, but nothing ever changed. I transferred to the brand new store to help out, and the manager there had everything in order, very kind and dedicated, and respected customers. "
good,The pay is really low but the job is a very fun environment. You meet a lot of new people that you'll build a great bond with. low pay and not enough hours is the only thing wrong
good,"You must very quick at stocking, mindful of thieves, and accurate with cash handling.  My biggest problem is that they only gave me 4-12 hours a week."
good,I worked with a handful of Pro Fessional people build relationships only two end off  to be terminated because of a  New hostile environment.  That cause me to open my eyes to a lot of things.
good,It was so much going on that team work wasn't good. Every body kinna did what they wanted to do.wasn't safe when it was only to people working at night hours wasn't good. Pay wasn't good but had to work to take care of my family
good,As GM there's always Alot going on the job is what you make but u have to find a balance ... ur paid weekly but can work up to 70 hours ubhave to be willing to give up somethings to be successful
good,"weekly work load and weekly payroll allowance do not balance"
good,The people you work with can be great but the corporate people them selves are horrible and they ask way to much from one person. It is good if you are part time but it will drain your sanity after awhile.
good,Lower management is uncoordinated and unprepared for job. Upper management is also ill trained and not qualified for job. Corporate does not care about employees.
good,Really didn't deserve to happen what did happen to me but it was an okay place to work for. Didn't get my full time spot or a raise just because I didn't fill in a shift at another store so they held it against me and I quit shortly after that.
good,It was okay to work here. Wish it was better to work but its not. Not much to say about working here they just need to update their systems and how they do things
good,"Long hours,  low pay, working off clock the norm..always threating to write us up. telling us we will be fired. Working by yourself all day."
good,"Although i enjoyed my job at Dollar general and made some great friends from my co-workers, they do expect a ridiculous amount of work for ridiculously little amount of pay"
good,"Well if you have to run register you have to do everything else to."
good,"Dollar General is an alright place to work when they are fully staffed. Management is doing the best that they can trying to bring people in, but ultimately it comes down to the upper management not hiring to the best of their abilities. Low pay for higher ups bundled with long hours, stock room being full due to underemployment, and sometimes weeks without a day off for the neglect of others to find new employees."
good,"Everyday customer experiences vary and gives you a challenge for exceptional customer service. Tasks are also a daily challenge, to maintain excellent customer service, tasks are continually interrupted to ensure satisfaction."
good,well i travled from  store to store helping them catch up i learned how to do planagrams and much more the only thing was is that they wouldnt put me full time because i didnt have a car
good,"As a cashier you are responsible for recovery of particular section of the store, cashing and putting out inventory from totes. Cashiers often have to handle more than one task simultaneously. It is very demanding and you have to be on your feet for the entire time you are scheduled to work aside from you break time.Usually only two people run the store at a time the manager and the cashier unless it truck day and more employees come in to put out inventory."
good,manager's position. learned in Microsoft ware / I also became the training mangers for new opening store in the area. I established business relationship and networked with many people and vendors. I was always reliable and on time
good,Was very hectic place to work but I learned a lot about the business world. High turnover which caused turmoil.
good,"There is on a manger and a sales associate ever night I close the store and the store manger refuses to give a extra person at night she wants the manger to recover the entire store, put up fraut from the truck at night,and to do deposit for the day at closing Because it is not a team atmosphere at all. If the store Manager doesn't want to do it she will put it on someone else or let it sit there for weeks.. i do not recommend and one work at this store unless you want to be doing everything on your own."
good,A company with a great concept. Could use more payroll to accomplish tasks that need to be addressed properly to raise the company to the next level.
good,I worked at Dollar General just to help me get through college.  I also played football so I only worked when I had time.  Dollar General was so flexible that we created a shift just for me from 9pm to 4am so I could stock all of the shelves.
good,management skills is lacking in people skills and friendliness. Poor attituteds and thereis a in crowd hiring . If you  aren't a friend you are  not hired
good,Enjoyed the environment most of the time. I enjoyed helping customers. It was retail and worked nights and was not comfortable working and traveling to and from late at night.
good,"Management did not do their jobs, nor did they have their employees. The stores are very messy and unorganized. They do not train their employees properly. The turn over rate for this company is crazy!"
good,"At the specific store that I worked at for a year and a half, management was awful. The manager did so many things that were against store policy, and still does. It made me very uncomfortable knowing it was happening in my store. "
good,"Enjoyable place to work, close to home, smiling faces from customers and other employees, clean work environment, not very stressful"
good,"Great job for students, not much room for advancement, and no full time hours."
good,It was okay they worked with my hours somewhat. I can tell you its not a job you would go back to. That pretty much sums it up.
good,"When I was working at Dollar General it was a pleasant job. Meet new people and learned how to work a cash register and many other thins. The hardest part of the work really nothing because, I love working hard and working around my boss and customers."
good,"If you like hard work then you will like retail. It could be an great job if they understood that people are not superheroes and we do get tired. This job requires strenuous work, lifting heavy items and completing planograms. In the 8 hours you spend there you will nfeel like you  have completed at least 16 hours of work."
good,"The work environment was fine and what you would expect, nothing too hectic, and worked with my schedule fairly well, but the management didn't seem to like to do their jobs or like to work with the cashiers."
good,When hours expanded our truck days were harder to meet and not enough help with work loads . Wished more help on heavy work days would have been available to all stores.
good,"I was the cashier. I cleaned (mopped and swept the floor). The manager at the time was not very good. She trained me all wrong. "
good,Opening and/or closing the store. Getting registers ready for cashiers to assist customers. Cleaning and presenting store for customers. Dollar General may be a good company to work for but the one I worked at was on a bad side of town which resulted in me being held at gunpoint and my windshield being smashed out.
good,The store I work at is a very busy. Fast paced.  Lots to do and not enough people to do it because short payroll.  Most employees prefer to earn there pay check by standing around which puts more work on the ones that actually work.  Makes it hard.  I do love what I do.  I prefer to stay busy and I love the people I meet on a daily basis.  I have so many loyal customers that know me buy name.
good,This position gave me the opportunity to put my people skills to use and to learn more about quality customer service. I did enjoy the diversity of multi-tasking and learning new skills to take with me in life.
good,Unfortunately this company does not promote loyalty or job security. Though I have learned a lot about loss prevention and the community the store was in.
good,"A typical day at work was usually stocking shelves, updating produces, checking peoples items out, and cleaning and organizing the store. Some of the things I learned was running a store so more produces sell, dealing with all types of customers, running a cash register (returns, food stamps, debit/credit, etc). Management was so out of place and scrambled up that half the time the store didn't have a manager at all and the co-workers where ok but depended on others to fill in if they didn't feel like coming in. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks when we got produce in. And the most enjoyable part of the job was work with the few people that actually got their work done and the store ran smoothly."
good,"Very laid back working enviroment, I learned how to run a cash register and how to be a responsible employee. My co-workers were all different some were hard workers while others were just rude and inconciderate and the store manager was always looking out for his employees. The pros were that i got some much needed experience in working and the cons were the job seemed very unorganized and the pay wasn't very good and no one really cared about working there."
good,The best part of the job is working with repeat customers. Coming from Wal-Mart it was better working with a small group. I enjoyed my co-workers but we had a hard time filling positions because i was only allowed to hire part time associates with no benefits and only at minimum wage. I was expected to work the rest which ended up at 50+ hours a week with no days off for months.
good,"A typical work day would be, for me, would be working from 3-10 (sometimes starting earlier, sometimes leaving around 11). I would work the cashier, keep my area clean and organized, and assist customers when needed. "
good,i enjoyed my job and looked forward to coming to work everyday. But because the store was brand new i feel that management was not where it needed to be. One of the biggest problems there was some managers had a problem with letting their personal feeling get in the way of their managerial duties by not being professional or unbiased.
good,my typical day is working taking care of custmor cash register and stocking and cleaning I learned that to be patitent and not to take everything every custmor says to u serious the managent is lots better now we got a new store manger the coworkers are aswome they are great my hardest pat of my job is stocking the most fun part of my job is dealing with the customer
good,"It is a good place to work, the management is friendly. The people who work there are kind and supporting. The jobs are a little fast paced but it is easy to adapt."
good,The store is completely unorganized so it is nearly impossible to actually complete the tasks required of you. The staff was predominately lazy outside of management.
good,"Used to be a fun place, used to be organized and easy to shop. Now not so much, stores are very disorganized, hard to shop. Hard to find anything."
good,The company was ok but the management put in place was not stable. The store I was in couldn't sustain because of faulty management. I wish I could've experienced another store to have a varied opinion but that's how it was at mine.
good,"I was responsible for supervising entry-level employees, assisting in the hiring process, overseeing retail operations, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Additional job duties included answering telephones, setting schedules, and communicating with Dollar General corporate offices."
good,"Open/ close store, responsible for counting money and preparing bank deposits. When closing would count till and start till for the net day. On Saturdays would unload truck and stock shelves and do any cleaning and putting up new products."
good,Its a fun place to work at if you have another job. If you are just relying on this job to pay bills you will have to get another job. Not a lot of hours are given
good,at this job i have worked so hard to help with the manager to complete dead lines. A lack of support and the micromanagement is just to much.
good,"8 hour day, sales, receiving, cash deposit, cleaning, stocking.customer service, phone calls.opening or closing. store management  not capable of fairness,all cashier employees too young no experience.hardest part lack of training always got the short end of the stick. the customers were the most enjoyable part of work."
good,The manager at the store made mistakes regarding the drawer and was not too friendly. It was not a very good experience for me. I always smiled. I liked making my customers feel happy.
good,It was a learning experience in big corporate companies. dealing with a variety of customers was very informative and enlightning.
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and dust broom sweep the entire store, mop, and then come back and burnish them. After the floor area is complete, It's your job to make sure the bathroom, dressing room, office rooms, and the store floors are detail cleaned and maintained its cleanliness."
good,"A typical day/week at work consists of scheduling employees, daily cash deposits, managing a staff of 8-10 employees, merchandising, stocking merchandise, and customer service.  There is a lot of room for advancement with this company, as I have held every position at store level (sales associate, lead sales associate, assistant manager and store manager).  I was also the merchandiser for the district of 10 stores to help set seasonal sets and planograms,"
good,"A typical day for me at work would be very busy."
good,I loved being a waitress at shoney's it was always an energetic work day from the time you walked in until you left. Great food and great staff.
good,This job can be stressful under certain working conditions and environments. Be sure to inspect the place before you commit. If the workers and work area are not to your liking then chances are they won't be when you begin to work.
good,"great place to work. The shifts were very enjoyable, but the management was very poor. I did not receive any good hours and my highest paycheck was $76.49."
good,wished i hasd been given more hours to work but glad to have been here because i gained experience inm a new area of retail; that i didnt have before
good,the people I work with was very nice and everybody was very melo. the customer I had come in where very nice and even funny. Sometimes I would treat my employee to donuts at the start of the day.
good,"Overall good experience, my co- workers were great very helpful when ever I work with somebody, manager always kept to herself when I worked with her. I now know where everything is in the store, and a loved that i got first pick of clothes when we just restocked."
good,"In my opinion they expect a lot out of their employees with little in return, hardly no in company advancements, the employees were the best part of the job."
good,"Working at the dollar store had its ups and downs, mostly downs. The energy was so negative and it made it hard to keep a positive attitude."
good,"Long, exhausting minimum of 48 hours weekly, usually work 65-70 hours. usually no breaks and bad areas to work in. High turnover rate."
good,"I Loved The Atmosphere. Being Around People And Making Their Day Better Made My Day Better. I Actually Learned A Lot While Working There. I Learned How To Do Cash Drops, I Learned How To Stock, And I Learned The Basic's Of A Retail Business. The Management Was Like A Team Effort, There Wasn't Just One Person In Charge And Whenever You Needed Help You Could Ask Anyone. My Co-Workers Were Friendly And Helpful. They Were Also Easy To Talk To. I Would Have To Say The Hardest Part Of The Job Was Stocking, Re-Stocking, And Maintenance. It Was The Hardest Because, There Were So Many Customers Coming In And Out, It Was Hard To Keep The Store Nice, Neat And Presentable. The Best Part About The Job Was Definitely Interacting And Socializing With All The Customers. Just Being Able To Have A Conversation With Them. You See Their Moods Change When They See You, Their Eyes Light Up When They Talk To You, And You Can Tell You Just Made That Person's Day, That's One Of The Best's Feelings In The World."
good,"On a day to day basis, I was consistently helping customers, putting away merchandise, counting registers, and cleaning the store."
good,"- The company does provide a customer focused work environment"
good,I wish that dollar general pays more. Its alot of standing i wouldn't send anyone for employment there they don't have enough staff
good,"Dollar general is a pretty laid back job. I would go in work on the register and stock medicine. It would be pretty slow in there till school let out."
good,"I love my job with Dollar General. If it wasn't for the poor benefits and the company being semi unorganized, this would be the ideal career path."
good,"At Dollar General the focus has always been quantity, not quality. This is effective to their inventory, as well as their staff and management style. Dollar General as a whole cares more about the bottom dollar than building a productive business structure. This business style has proven to be productive to a point. The positive is the company has thousands of stores nationwide, mostly in rural and poverty areas.  What the general public doesn't see is the general employee turnover rate of 2-3 weeks, minimum wage pay for all employees, including management, and a profit/ loss margin that is nearly upside-down. The result of this structure is evident by the lack of customer service going back to you get what you pay for."
good,I enjoy working here except they work the employees to the bone.  Employees are expected to do alot for only getting paid minimum wage.
good,"Open/Close the store, set up planograms, cash handling, train/supervise team of 8, lower shrinkage, increase customer service surveys, inventory."
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General involves interacting with customers to ensure an enjoyable shopping experience that meets their needs. I've learned several new skills such as how to be an effective cashier, how to properly stock merchandise, what to do in case of emergencies, etc. As it is with any company, the management positions at Dollar General requires extensive training and knowledge in order to maintain store operations on a daily basis."
good,I work a few hours a week as a cashier and the store located on South Popular St in Elizabethtown.  I also help with putting up the stock that comes in on the truck weekly.  We are in charge of helping customer locate what that are looking for and keeping the store clean.
good,Really hard to make rate because of the way their computer system was set up.  Really hard to communicate with managers and coworkers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that they did sometimes give us free lunches and sweatshirts etc. Very cold climate and people were rude a lot of times.
good,"Steady work, GREAT workers, terrible management! They want you to work all day to finish the impossible.!"
good,Good people to work with.  Long hours if you are in management.
good,"Get to work, clock in, verify cash drawer, start stocking shelves, ring customers out, clean restrooms and floors, then clock out and leave."
good,"Good place to work, this company promotes from within and you have to have a full flex schedule"
good,"I enjoyed talking to the customers. The hours were fine except I did not enjoy working every weekend, but just learned to deal with it. I learned where items home were at and how to stock faster. It was managed really well and I liked all the people I worked with. The hardest part of this job was closing which meant you stayed to nearly 11 pm and then turn around be back at 5 am in the morning. The most enjoyable part was talking to our regular customers and hearing from management when customers would brag on me."
good,A typical day for me was to stock the shelves. The managment team was ok to work with most of the time. The co-workers were ok to work with as part of the team. The hardest part of the job would have to be that I had no health insurance. The great thing about the job was making new friends.
good,I am not a very EARLY morning person and my manager for the most part had worked around that because I am more productive at night or later in the day. Very fast paced environment. Only had a break if worked passed 6 hours.
good,"Overall Dollar General is a productive place of employment when everyone is on the same page as one another. Most times the work load was overbearing because when didn't have enough employees to cover the work load which made it harder on everyone else. I did not like the fact that I put in extra hours but didn't get paid for it.If I had to do it again, I wouldn't do it."
good,To make sure the store is customer ready at all times. Get the new items out for the season. Get the products out on the shelf in a timely manner so the customer can get what they are there looking for. Do resets of the shelves for that time with the holiday etc. I was the assistant manger of the store other management there was a little rough because there was not communication with them. I enjoyed working with other employees we all got along good everyone knew what had to be done from day to day we all came in jumped in together and got things done. When you are unhappy customers and you have to do whatever you can to make them happy or understand what is being done to fix the problem.
good,A great job with great people to work with. Enjoyed my time there because of the people i met.
good,Was my first job. it taught me how to run the cash register and abt inventory. nice place for teens.
good,After knowing the employers here for awhile i decided to start working there. After my first few weeks i saw a very unhappy place to work. Nobody worked together and everyone was just not nice. I did not like working here at all. Late nights and just rude co-workers are not what a high school kids wants.
good,Enjoyed working with all employees except my last manager. She didn't seem to care that I had a disability and help me. She also called me names.
good,"I got along well with my manager and other employees. The upper management, such as the area supervisor, really lack any concern for our store. The were no bathrooms in a safe location. It was located in our stock room near the office. Our office door was broke into while I and the manager was working up front.They would not allow us to have more than two people during the day, unless it was during truck days I enjoyed working with the public and stocking shelves with new product but the company did not allow us to have much freedom in making the store more organized."
good,Dollar General was not really a bad employer. I actually had a good time working with the people I worked with and the ones that worked for me. Besides the fact that the cooperate office wanted the work of 3-5 people done by one person and the district manager was not understanding of her workers needs in order to make life with the company run smoothly.
good,This company makes it very hard to get hired. They need to make it a bit easier for the hiring process.
good,The company as a whole has poor oversight and not enough proper structure. The Store Manager's are allowed entirely too much freedom in the way the sore is operated.
good,"This is a terrible job if you are trying to surround yourself with success, but if you're in high school and need a few bucks go for it."
good,Not enough help for you to get done what the cooperate office wants. Have to work long hours at night and be back first thing in the morning.
good,"DG tends to be very frugal, which is good in some aspects, others not so good.  "
good,An average day working here is hectic yet enjoyable. Usually consisting of stocking product and assisting customers in finding products or manning the cash register. Management was decent and so were the co-workers. It assisted me in improving my communication skills.
good,okay job; not too difficult for someone in school working part-time. Just don't overdo it with the hours
good,"A usual day of work consisted of cleaning, stocking, recovering, running the cash register and closing. to much work for minimum wage."
good,I worked for Dollar General for 9 months without given the chance to move ahead.
good,"Provide the be customer service possible. Great customers as they come in check customers out, handle money, and clean up at the end of the day."
good,"A typical day of work included moving heavy equipment, stocking shelves, blocking shelves, cleaning and assembling basic structures.  I learned that work can be a pleasant experience if you make it.  Management wasn't too demanding, they worked side by side with us so they felt like co-workers."
good,"A day of work at Dollar General would start off with me getting on the cash register an getting yelled at by customers. I would then have to count the registers, stock the shelves, and take the money that we make to the bank. I learned how to communicate with all different types of people. I was the manager at the job so the management was very good. The other workers at the job was very lazy and wouldnt do the work that I told them to do. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the customers that came through the door drunk. The best part of the job was me getting to talk to different kinds of people throughout the work day."
good,There were no emergency alarm protocols.  Another female coworker and myself were working alone one night and we were threatened by a customer.  He waited outside the doors for a very long time.  We called 911.  Eventually we called our boss at home.  He showed up so that he could escort us out to our cars.  The police never showed.  If he had decided to break the unprotected glass doors then we could have been seriously hurt.  There should have been an emergency alarm in place for situations like that.
good,The job is easy. If you get the right team for a store its an awesome place to work. The company itself....well they say they hire from within which is true but you have to really fight for it. In my almost six years of working there I had at least six different managers. My first district manager did not appreciate the work I did. I worked my but off. At one time I was working three stores....three different towns...every week. & they refuse overtime and if youre part time youre lucky if you get 15-20 hours.
good,"I adore the friendly atmosphere, with both co-workers and customers, of Dollar General. I also enjoy always having a task to be done and always moving around. However, hard work is not always rewarded.  Also, I do not like how they hesitate to fix things in their stores. You have to spend money to make money, especially in retail. Presentation is everything."
good,was a good job as a stepping stone to get through school or college...
good,"Was a cashier and then Assistant Manager, opened and closed store, checked in vendors, and the truck. trained new employees, help customers. Did the ordering and the payroll, and went to the bank doing deposits and getting change. Stocked shelves, set up displays, cleaned store, ran cash register, answered phones. Ran the store for 2 weeks when we didn't have manager, open to close 7 days a week, with only 2 other people. I love working with public and helping people. but it doesn't pay well at all."
good,I like the work it was fast paced not alot of down time that is what I liked keepin busy. Had alot of turn around because they put alot of work on people before they were ready.
good,Enjoy working with customers and co-workers. Have learned more of the do's and don't's of retail. Work under a great manager but there is no support from further up the management chain. Corporate expectations are not realistic in most cases but the crew does try their hardest with little recognition which is the hardest part of the job. See great potential in fellow employees that are leaving due to poor pay.
good,Overall Dollar General has been a good company to work for. While working for Dollar General I learned how to better manage employees and run an efficient store. I enjoy being in a management position and interacting with the costumers.
good,"No set schedule as a part-time worker, I am responsible for finding out what hours are assigned to me each week. Usually less than 25 to 30 hours total. I have learned to be patient & responsive to customers who frequent the store & how to check on sale items as they are advertised. Our goal is to satisfy our clients. The manager and I get along well, being as we are friends. My co-workers have always been kind to me and help each other when the need arises."
good,I would run cashier and stock merchandise. I had to greet the customers and help if the needed any assistance.
good,Amount of payroll is too little with the amount of work expected. Managers are expected to work hours alone in such a big store and makes it easy target for robbery.
good,"I learned new things working here everyday. there is always something to do. Clean, stock, recover, etc. Loved my co-workers, all very nice and outgoing."
good,I was a key holder and therefore like a manager (without the pay).  I took care of tills and inventory and of course all complaints and refunds.  The turn over rate was so high that i started training the now key holders and managers but was not promoted myself. That was the hardest part of the job.  Training people and then watching them get promoted over me.  I really enjoyed putting up stock and rearranging the shelves.
good,The customer experience was great the coporate side of things was kind of shade but it was a job
good,"A typical day at work was usually to unload shipments and the stock the product accordingly"
good,"cashier and stock,order and assist customers,was taught to make schedules,order,and do all phases of store"
good,"This is the hardest job I have ever had due to the turnover of employees, when you have a couple people who find a job that pays more and then leave it puts the Manager to working every day without any day off sometimes for weeks due to there hiring practice having to wait so long for back ground checks before you can hire someone else."
good,i have not been able to have a life since working with this company
good,"A typical day at work would be running back and forth between stocking shelves and running register for customers. I was told to leave register in order to work shelves but also pressured to somehow know when I have customers at my register. There's no bell for the customer to ring to let me know they're there while I'm away down an aisle stocking toothpaste. This type of work construct seemed silly to me. At other retail stores, when it is not busy, cashiers are told to find something to do such as cleaning the register area, sweeping, fixing and organizing things but staying close to register area so as not to miss customers or make them wait. But here I would have to leave the register area, as lead cashier, in order to stock products down the front aisles. Often times I'd be running back to register to check if a customer had gotten in line only to see no one was in line, so I'd go back to stocking and then not one minute later a line of customers would appear, looking disgruntled that no one was at register. Sometimes it'd be so busy that I'd never even get to leave register so I wouldn't even get any stocking done that day. I was unable to get full time. My hours were often all over the place with schedules given on Fridays therefore not being able to plan for the weekend.All in all, not the worst job in the world but if you are looking for a job with opportunity and a living wage, I suggest looking elsewhere."
good,the little rushes we have and I enjoy the people I work with. to check in a vender that has a smart mouth is the hardest thing of the day .c
good,"Everything changes daily, Easy workflow as long as it is followed day by day."
good,"okay job, little pay for the work load, and no time for family. Communication between store managers and upper management needs improvement. My team was great. Typically for the first 6 hours of day the store manager is the only one in store, which makes it difficult to get tasks done."
good,"Come in, usually the other manager leaves and I get a list of things to do. I am alone usually for about 3 or 4 hours and my cashier comes in. If the cashier or customers have a problem I handle them. The hardest part is being alone because in retail it is hard to multi task sometimes, the most enjoyable is when I am in a busy state of mind. The day goes by faster and I feel accomplished getting things done."
good,"I like my manager and assistant manager, but the lead cashier needs to go. I was thrown into being a cashier and haven't had much training in other areas of the store. Most of my co-workers are pretty nice and are good workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the customers or not having a back-up cashier when the store gets busy. Our store is messy because nobody has time to reset it. The main thing is to help customers and get freight out. I am part time so I get about 20 hours a week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers as well. Most are very nice. There is no store discount for employees, but they offer discounts with other companies which I think is really stupid. The schedule is all over the place but it's retail so that is to be expected. It's a decent job to bring in extra income or for students looking for a first job."
good,"Run register, clean and stock store, clean parking lot, assist customers with purchases to their vehicles when needed. I learned how to use the credit card machine, how to enter in the checks, and how to add a tax exempt person. Management was fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was trying to stock the store and run the register at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my day would be when the regulars would come in. We would chat for a little bit about our days so far, and what has happened since the last time we had seen each other."
good,"I don't know about other stores in the DG chain, but the store I worked at was not that good. I had no hours, and my manager was more worried about making her bonus over helping customers."
good,"working by yourself  because they give you no payroll,putting out truck and running the register all by yourself it was not a good experience for me because i had to put in 60 or 70 hours a week to keep the store st its best ."
good,Weekends are mostly taken up of restocking the shelves with products for the delivered truck that week. During the week its a lot slower so that is usually taken up of setting up new POG's and making the store look clean and presentable.
good,"I worked really hard at Dollar General I even watched several employees come and go, I helped hire and train people."
good,My day at Dollar General involved primary sales to customers and maintaining store cleanliness. I learned how to work in a fast pace  environment as well as meeting certain goals within small time frames.
good,Working for Dollar General was great. The only thing about Dollar General was no hours at all. That's hard when you have a family.
good,"The job had a small staff, usually only two employees working in the store on night shift. Very routine, a typical day after punching in is standing at the register to ring customers up ad between customers front facing the shelves in the food asiles."
good,"Although I enjoyed the actual work, of being a cashier, helping customers, even shelving and doing inventory, other than one specific Assistant manager, management was not great while I worked there. In fact, NO ONE from when I worked there is employed by them, with the exception of 2 cashiers. "
good,"Work was not hard,but management was a little difficult to deal with.Pay was not that great."
good,"Dollar General is not the place to work if you are really trying to make money, The job is physically strenuous for low pay. I recommend this job to high school and college students only."
good,"Great stores, growth was too fast.  Extremely weak field team especially the Hr Team."
good,Enjoyed working with & helping customers!! Co Workers were awesome people to work with!
good,"I enjoyed working with ones I did, it was sad to say that the store manager had her favorites but that happens. I went in to do my job and helped out picking up hours when needed."
good,Poor district management. Store managers were replace all the time and didn't have managerial experience. No room for advancement for loyal employees. 
good,gret customers with a friendly attitude help and assist customers
good,Around inventory time you're expected to almost work around the clock even if you have class. They will allow you to leave to attend class but there isn't much time for sleep in between work and school. A typical day isnt to bad it just gets to be a lil boring if the store is slow that day.
good,"Dollar General really open me up to become more outgoing and talkative. Being in management position was stressful at times because when things aren't right all the pressure falls back on you . The hardest part was being in training and having to learn how to manage all that money and run the store while all the other managers are off duty and it's just the sales associate , and you . I hated it whenever we ran out of money or bags because , the customers became very angry. The most part i enjoyed was the team work , and meeting new people and seeing new faces."
good,Dollar General micro manages so bad that even management is easily replaced. Their expectations are drastically unacheivable yet they expect you to be accountable for them. They offer no assistance to help reach your goals and they treat their employees very badly with constant accuasations and badgering.
good,I met a lot of great people working at Dollar General. The management was not that great. Not a lot of communication between the manager and employees. The co-works were great and fun to work with. Great team work between co-workers.
good,I enjoyed the environment and atmosphere in the store with communication between workers and customers. I learned how to have a grumpy customer leave smiling.
good,"My typical day at work at Dollar General was somewhat interesting. I would meet people i've never seen before and see new faces that would be glad to see me as they walk in there store. I learned how to greet people into the store, run the cash register, stock the shelves and much more. My co-workers were very friendly but the manager wasnt that much. The hardest part of working at Dollar General was keeping up with the customaers while cashing out, and try not to upset them with how busy the store could be. As i set that aside i'd have to say stocking the shelves with my co-workers was very entertaining and i got along with everybody."
good,I like working with Dollar General because of the customers. I enjoy talking to them and being able to help them. Dollar General does not care about thier employees very much and does not make it a safe enviroment. There is never enough payroll to keep two or more employees on shift during morning hours. The employee turnover is very high due to lack of payroll. Hardest part of the job is trying your best and never being acknowledged.
good,My experience with Dollar General thus far has been satisfactory.
good,The associates got worked to death. I witnessed a 30+ week pregnant woman being told to life heavy objects and working 10+hrs.
good,"Been a good steady job.I""v leared alot about customer service and working with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the holiday season. but the best part is the satifation I get when my work is done and complete. I take pride in my work."
good,"Working with great co-workers, stocking the store working cash register helping each person. Days was long, and days where I hated going in."
good,"Introduced me to logistics supervisor position. Hands on training, learned how to use WMS."
good,"Helping and assisting our customers with their purchasing in the store. Make change for cashiers. Make desposit at bank. Restock shelves, make sure store was always clean. Management was excellent my co-workers was also respectful of one another. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people."
good,Assistanting customers and provided excellent service to customers and co-workers
good,"The management wasn't great. Was offered a raise, but never received it."
good,"To conduct orientations, train new and exisiting employees, chart progress of trainees, attend weekly meetings and help with different events for the facility. The co-workers were pleasant to work with. The job was enjoyable because I had the opportunity to help people gain knowledge of their position."
good,"A typical day at work is to start with the mail tasks, the go on to new re-sets, make sure all stock is out of receiving room, make sure all totes have been worked through, check emails from District Manager and complete tasks as requested. Every day is different since there are new tasks on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is to schedule 6 employees with only a 123 hour budget. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new customers, working with the team I work with and the reward of hearing how nice the store looks or how organized it is!"
good,open or close the store did no like dealing with dm liked my co workers very hard workers hardest part was keeping up paper work enjoyable is customers
good,its a lot of hard work. two people on duties for each shift except truck days if the limited budget will let you add another person to help the work load.
good,"Everyday I closed the store or opened it, made sure employees were at work and inside ready to receive their job for the day. I closed deposits made sure they were ready to go to the bank. I set the store up reset merchandise ran the register fixed problems with the registers, approved voids, aborts, refunds, returns, also cleaned and made sure the store was nicely recoverd before each closing night. I sent payroll, checked in vendors made sure each documentation was filled and written down."
good,"Being a manager for Dollar General or any type of retail store has the same basic concepts for managing a store and a staff. A typical day at work would consist of doing alot of paperwork, checking e-mails, confrence calls, store meetings, checking in venders and taking in weekly truck, hiring and firing staff members,following and updating plan-o-grams,stocking shelves, finding homes for over-stock items, resolving customer services issues, making safe drops and bank deposits. I've learned to be more assertive when it came to disiplinary actions with employees. But overall i loved the fact that im able to work with the general public and making my customers satisfied and made sure i had repeated lasting relationships with my customers."
good,"I never got to work here long because of school, but they never gave me full training. I had to figure things out for myself. Customers would ask me questions that I had no idea how to answer."
good,"-A typical day at work consists of stocking freight or reseting plan-o-grams, helping customers, and assisting vendors."
good,"I would say that this will be a great first job for a teenager. Although this is a great atmosphere to work in, Dollar general gives barely any hours. Some days I would work 8 hours a week. The managers slacked as far as work went. However the employees were delightful."
good,"The managers couldn't agree on things, there was a high theft rate because of the neighborhood the store was in. Gossip among employees was problematic."
good,You are not given enough hours to really make it a career. The hours are more for school students that need to make a little money.
good,good place tow ork for college or high school students do not offer full time work but easy work and nice management
good,"I like working for company,good customers,the best part is knowing that I help make the store I sucessful an clean,"
good,The managers were a little unorganized but very nice. The store is very scattered.
good,Its Not Worth The Time An Pay Ratio i spent alot of hours there an it never matched with my pay it was always an excuse but the staff was excellent and friendly
good,Job was easy and my trainer was awesome. They dont offer temps anything but overall its what you make of it... Do the work and your job is secured. Its very laid back though.
good,I learned a good bit about how DollarGenerals management is and i loved it. I also enjoyed working with customers and making sure the shelves was stocked at all times and the store looked its all time best.
good,"Didn't like the job. The company threatens staff with termination if you don't keep up with workflow but doesn't allow you to to cover the store with staff, so you're constantly getting robbed by shoplifting because a lot of times there's only one person in the whole store"
good,Dollar general needs improvement in many aspects the store is run down old computer system to non working bathrooms to over working the employees an treating them like they are disposable
