good,"My old company got bought out by IBM I am thankful I am"
good,"IBM is a good company, but they are constantly changing sales territories, portfolio and accounts. It was hard to get any continuity when we change every 6 months. It's such a large company, It's hard to understand how/why decisions are made."
good,Loved my time at IBM I would still be there if not for talk of leaving the EU.  Was made redundant.  Could work from any location and had a great time and Manager.

good,"Buena empresa. "
good,Compagnia adatta per una lenta crescita professionale ma con la capacita di vedere piu sistemi
good,Hardest thing to deal with is IBMs shift in managment. Changes to project goals from a business point of view vs a technical point of view. Hard to keep team upbeat and focused on very technical issues when they can dismiss them so easily

good,IBM is a very good place to learn . As a fresher I have joined IBM in March 2015 . I have completed 3 years in IBM now. I gained lot of knowledge from my seniors . But only one thing I was concerned about is very less salary hikes in IBM.
good,"Minha atuação profissional estava direcionada a suprir as demandas de negócios dentro das dependências do cliente e por este motivo, havia um pouco de distanciamento na convivência com os demais profissionais e com a cultura empresarial. Por ser uma empresa de grande porte e com metas globais as questões menores mesmo que importantes podiam não ter um tempo de resposta tão ágil ou abrangente. De forma geral é uma excelente empresa para profissionais em estruturação de carreira, dinâmicos e que gostem de desafios. Gostei muito da experiência e da aprendizagem."
good,"It's a great place to work with."
good,You must be politically astute to stay at IBM.  They are endlessly trying to re-invent themselves.  If you are with the wrong brand within IBM and they shift market focus you will be the target of an IBM RA (resource action) what others in the industry call a RIF (reduction in force) or laid off.  Promotions were non-existent and any that occurred were IMHO highly political.

good,"IBM was an exciting work environment. Best in class ERP system and technology. Short fall is they know they are the best and do not pay well. Regardless, IBM is the place to become a professional."
good,IBM is a great place to work. If you are an active worker that likes exposure and likes to participate in different projects you can do it while working on your role and growing your professional skills.

good,"A typical day would be busy from start to finish in most cases.  there was always a learning situation every single day from learn how to install updates, patches, etc.  Management seem to always have your back and there for you whenever you needed them for anything.  The driving from one site to another was stressful sometimes, and the long hours of working to achieve the deadline.  the job it self is  a thrill and being pay every week was worth the over time on the assignment that had to be submitted through PDA hand held and also FAX."
good,My time with IBM was fantastic for learning new concepts and tools. I spend time with many interesting people at many interesting locations. I would recommend this job to others that are interested in traveling frequently to 100% of the time. The opportunity for advancement is definitely there as long as you know how to look or who to talk to.

Omgang met de collega´s was fantastisch en ook de kansen die je kreeg om door te groeien cq te veranderen van baan waren uitstekend. Dit is echter de laatste jaren een stuk minder geworden allemaal. De zin om te werken verdween op een gegeven moment steeds meer, mede omdat er steeds vaker collega´s verdwenen omdat hun werk naar het buitenland werd overgebracht.

The toughest part was the day I found out that I was being ""resourced"", their term for ""layoff"".  I found no logic in this.  However, it wasn't just me; thousands of others worldwide were going through the same thing.  I do not agree with the approach the company has taken, which resulted in my ""resource action"".  However, I look back on my employment there with a smile and feel that I was blessed to learn new things and meet so many talented people."

You have to be very careful and polite and ask them to same time you if you do not think you correctly heard what they said, once you do that then you are on a good path to communications.  Hardest part of the job is keeping some people from your team from jumping off a ledge.

Though metrics — believing you can write X amount of reports or talk to Y amount of clients in one week — can be a short-term motivator, having more meaningful goals, such as developing your communication skills or writing the most comprehensive report you’ve ever written on a certain subject can help you think of your job in terms of a big picture.

They preached work life balance but back in the day there wasn't much balance at all. We worked odd hours and on the weekends so they never walked the walk when it came to W/L balance. Loved that we could work at home, and basically had a pretty flexible schedule. I left back in 2008 and that was when they have ""project lean"" going on. There was quite a bit of outsourcing to other countries and so a lot of people got laid off because of this. Not sure how it is today as I don't keep in contact with many employees."

In times of struggle or confusion for my team, several other employees were quick to show us how to easily solve an issue or explain concepts. The general vibe from the entire company was nothing short of helpful and kind. The only thing hard about this job was probably the learning curve that came with it, but our manager tried her best to alleviate that.

La gerencia es muy buena, con un enfoque orientado a la confianza, accesible y con un alto valor humano y los colegas son personas muy cooperativas y accesibles. La parte más difícil de trabajo sería quizás armonizar la administración del tiempo entre las tareas por hacer, solicitudes y reuniones. Lo que más me gustó fue adquirir nuevos conocimientos, conocer nuevos profesionales, además de que es un ambiente muy relajado para trabajar y permiten trabajar desde casa, cierta cantidad de días a la semana."

I have learnt to deal with stress, to use different programs (Excel, PowerPoint, and other company related platforms), to be agile, flexible and communicate effectively with senior management. The team leaders and managers were easily approachable, friendly and willing to support the colleagues. The communication was always informal. We used to have meeting with the manager every second month and discuss future career development. The team was mostly of young people (age below 30). The most difficult was to learn and memorise a lot of information for short time and be able to deliver results based on it. Fortunately, the managers, team leaders and colleagues of mine were very supportive, the competition between us was very low so the incentive to help was reciprocal."

I was given excellent benefits and a highly-professional work environment both in the office and through telepresence while working from home. Management of my team was excellent, backed by a comprehensive managerial review program and trained mentors to guide me through any of my needs. The most difficult aspects were an unbalanced work/life schedule, requiring me and many in my team to work 18 hours per day at verious times of the year, although I never considered this a drawback considering the benefits I was given. However, the primary reason I left IBM was due to job security. My department was outsourced to Colombia, Peru, and Mexico and the company had cut its workforce by half in the time I was with them.

We collected data on various community buildings in order to convert their social impact into cash terms.

Seeing the building for ourselves and being told about how it benefits local people by someone so involved and passionate made the social impact much more tangible. The village has very few social spaces and local services, so Blandford Hall really provides services that would otherwise not be provided. It provides clubs, activities, a shop, local services such as nursery groups, and community events, which make remarkable differences to the lives of local people. Seeing the impact that one community building can make has shown me the real differences that can be made on a small budget, the social value of these services, and has inspired me to create social impact in my own career."
