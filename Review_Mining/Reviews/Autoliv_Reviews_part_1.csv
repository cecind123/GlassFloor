bad,"This is a terrible place to work.They don't care about employees,hostile work environment.Nightmare don't apply,you will be sorry.The second shift oversee is a complete joke."
bad,Ugyanaz a monoton munka mindennap.Megtanultam biztonsági öveket összeszerelni.Hát az emberek nemigazan tuftak normálisan vodelkedni egymással .3müszak igencsak kimeritő és fárasztó volt az ember szervezetére. Amikor végeztünk a munkával időben.
bad,"I have learnt good communication skills,management,people skills,professionalism.The growth at this company was very phenomenal as it increased my confidence at work."
bad,Management separates themselves from production with a holier than thou attitude.  not worth the stress in your life working 6-7 days a week for the rest of your life
bad,Autoliv was a fine place to work if you didnt have to support or take care of a family. Emergencies were see as nuisances. injuries were mocked and those returning from surgeries were mocked and management made them miserable in hopes they would quit
bad,"Terrible ran company that strives on picking favorites,  suicide always was on the mind. Every morning when my alarm ring, all I could think about was, oh good time to drive to the pits of scum."
bad,"-Montieren und Qualitätprüfung "
bad,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, aprendi a atuar no departamento de Compras no primeiro mês, ambiente muito amigável, gerencia competente e flexível, a parte mais difícil é conviver com a sombra da crise no setor automotivo."
bad,"Working for that company was the worst experience I've ever encountered in my life, the management was so racist and also the working hours were not considered in our favour."
bad,"Manual labor repeating the same motions over and over. Short breaks. Competitive. Working hard is never good enough. Not enough days off for how draining the job is. Employees aren’t a priority. Atmosphere is stressful, and angry. Management doesn’t listen to employees concerns or ideas."
bad,You would work 7 days a week. Some times up to a month straight or even more mandatory or get written up. 3 write ups and they sent you home for 3 days and 6 write ups and then they decided whether to keep You
bad,"November 8-àn kezdünk pàrommal,munkaerő kölcsönzés àltal...Olyan sorra keültem ahol azonnal megitélt a sor végén àllo ,,kisfőnők'',és a kollégàim.Persze szoban nem de tetteikkel éreztették.Több alkalommal kértem hogy feladata révén,magyaràzza el,és mutassa,ill.tanitsa meg a munkafolyamatokat,és az ehez szolo papirokat.... különböző okokkal ezt elutasitotta,mindősszesen hàrom alkalommal egyszer probàlhattam  meg a gépeken dolgozni,csak szegecselni és összeszerelni engedett,és ez parancsba is adta."
bad,Quality is stress in main meetings.  Undertones rest of the time run fast make more and more parts.  The higher up you go the  more finger point at you.
bad,"Worked as a manager at the local production facility. My manager was located at a separate facility. I received no direction, only criticism for managing by exception - which is all one can do absent a plan. My manager also chose to disparage Manufacturing, Engineering and Quality at my facility rather than work toward constructive solutions or even communicate an actual plan. It is a wonder I was able to build any relationships at all with other teams on site. I actually received more constructive insight from the Quality Director than my own manager, who clearly had her sights on something else."
bad,The work was great and also the employees but Management sucked the AMT’S which are like leads talk to you like you are a little kid they have no respect and they do a lot of favoritism as long as you have a Relative in  management then you will never get a write up.
bad,"Autoliv used to be a good place to work. Over the years they have slowly stopped doing things for their employees to show appreciation.  Also recently the management, business culture group (or APS department), and H.R. seem to have stopped working together.  They have recently forced the associates on the floor to work in a manner that is already showing increased safety issues causing repetitive motion injuries.  With a possible fire safety hazard because of the way they have confined the workspaces."
bad,This job was the most ridiculous job I have ever worked. They wanted me to work ten hour shifts six days a week. I felt that was very unfair as they wanted me to continue going to school so they could advance me to a higher position. That is not all. They want you to work faster then it is humanly possible to meet their customer needs.
bad,Treats employees as replaceable robots. High turnover rate due to treatment of employees. Pay and benefits are the only good thing about this company. Working 7 days a week is a constant.
bad,This is a sweat shop and no more. People work six to seven days a week for months and months and have no family time. Management is clueless and is not supported by many of the hard working people there.
bad,Learning about car safety and how air bags are made was really cool.
bad,The work day consisted of using machinery to fold and assemble airbags for Dodge pickups.
bad,"I was witness to this first-hand. I was part of the hiring process for leads and trainers. An associate would come in to interview, be amazing and answer everything right, but they already had someone else in mind before they even started. And that person usually was coached or did not do very well, but it did not matter. The supervisor's would all gossip about a person right when they walked out of the room and repeat rumors about them. It was awful. They demote people who do well but are strong willed, then they allow the ""yes men"" to stay in their positions even though they do not deserve them. The HR staff is horrible and extremely unapproachable."
bad,"My comments are only directed towards the GM at the Olive Branch facility, as well as the managers and HR at corporate.The other plants I visited in Utah, Indiana and Tijuana seemed more professional, I didn't see any unprofessionalism in those facilities."
bad,Autoliv guzel bir fabrika fakat yönetim görevini hakkiyla yapmiyor bunun örnekleri var.ama buraya sığdirmak zor.........
bad,"Nem volna semmi baj a céggel ha tanult emberek lennének a sorvezetök illetve csoportvezetök. De amig nyalizással kurválkodással lehet főnöknek lenni..addig azt mondom nulla a,felsö vezetés"

bad,La gente es egoísta y grosera el salario malo y los horarios pésimos y pesados
bad,"I gave my everything.   in our location it was who do you know.  Broke my Heart.   Bad relation with Human Resource.   bad bad people. Safety issues: I addressed safety issues  and leadership issues and was put to task to fail. Shame on Autoliv ,Auburn hills Human Resource and Material Control Dept. superv and mgr. shame."
bad,Travail agréable . Mauvaise ambiance entre intérimaire.
bad,"Too many managers and no engineers, impossible to even have a life when you are working 60 hours a week, management only supports the hottest fire of the day"
bad,able to make good money but everyone is always worried about whether they will have a job at any moment. The HR manager at the plant in Tremonton does not listen to both sides of a story. Favoritism is huge and he ruined my career because he listened to lies from a group of people who spend the weekend getting drunk together.
bad,"My AMT Was actually the best, whenever I had a problem he was always willing to help. But the AMG treated me like I was lesser than her.I would have stayed If I had felt like I was actually cared about as a human."
bad,No room for advancement within supply chain roles. Purchasing management displays poor leadership and inflexibility to their employees. Glad I'm gone.
bad,"Upper management talks about improving morale but it's only talk meant to give false hope to short term employees. Career workers are frequently fired just before retirement unless you are a favorite, even then no guarantees. "
bad,"They look at seniority in the company vs actual performance for promotions. Lots of highly unmotivated people, pretty negative work enviorment. And working long weeks or short weeks, no balance between the two."
bad,"I hired in the test labs with an optimistic mindset. The longer I stayed there (which wasn't long) I quickly saw disconnects between management and engineers, no consistency to anything, making it very hard to learn and stressful. The lack of support from all facets of the team,  The lack of a fully staffed lab put more burden on the employees who had to do the work of 3 or more people for less than average pay. But the biggest factor for me to pursue another opportunity is the horrendously low morale, very depressive atmosphere took a toll on me. Coming home and dreading dealing with the same issues the next day. All in all I gave it a chance, perhaps others have better experiences. I left to take a similar position but in a different product line, for about 20% salary increase."
bad,Un dia tipico de ir a trabajar sin motivacion alguna
bad,"Összeszerelőként dolgoztam ott 3 hónapot, nagy volt a stressz az elvárt 500 óránkénti darabszám, valamint némely kolléga bunkósága miatt. Nagyon gyors kéz kell hozzá. Nagyjából 8 órán át egy helyben kell állni a munkához. Közvetítőn keresztül voltam, akik ott húztak le, ahol tudtak, és folyamatosan a levegőben volt, hogy kirúgják a közvetített embereket. Vicc hogy Karácsonykor az autolives dolgozók ajándékot kaptak, míg mikor mi mentünk az ajándékozó helyre, közölték, h nekünk nem jár."
bad,"There is no supervisor on the shift. The other shifts seem to be more favored as in treated better. The standards aren't followed the same between views on what is a good or bad part when they should be. Have no motivation to perform the job well, cause we'll have to work overtime no matter how well or bad we do. Only perform well to keep the job. There's smiles but no one is really happy there."
bad,This job was very stressful. Unorganized and chaotic. However it does give you the opportunity to learn how to juggle and apply your skills.
bad,fabrication sur ligne de boucles de ceintures. certains postes sont trop répétitifs.
bad,"Working at autoliv was a good oppurtunity, Was my first job in production and i got to learn many hand on tools and help manufacture air bags that help save lives everyday. The job it self was very hard and fast paced and if you werent up to speed like the rest of your team you would hold the enitre line back. My favorite part about the job was the friends that i made why i worked there."
bad,It is a decent job and company for a short term job. Wouldn't recommend staying there longer than absolutely necessary. Not many opportunities to move up and fewer and fewer perks of the job yearly.
bad,Terrible management system. HR rep was clueless and took forever to respond to questions. Extremely difficult to contact and the working environment was terrible with lots of back biting and management was not confidential at all. Would not be on my recommendation list for others to work.
bad,"I really enjoy working at autoliv but it definitely has it's many downfalls. The main downfall about being in the pyro department is that in your interview they WILL lie to you and tell you what you want to hear about the job. Everyone I have talked to has been told that they will only have to work overtime once in a while and rarely often. On my most recent weeks, I went 29 days in a row before finally being offered a day off. No, that is not by my own choice... 29 days in a row forced overtime until my name got to the top of the list for a day off. If you like working 7 days a week, this may be the job for you then!"
bad,It's basically like being in high school. Everyone is always gossiping and spreading rumors just cuz their bored. I pretty much can guarantee that you will get harassed working there. Then if you decide to report it they will treat it like a joke and do nothing to help the situation. They just tell the other people that you reported them just making the situation even worse. But the actual job is awesome perfect balance of physical activity without beating you into the ground every day
bad,"lideres e encarregados muito mal treinados supervisores ausentes, pessoas de pouca instrução acadêmica nas linhas de produção o que eleva o nível de fofoca e falsidade entre pessoas que não entendem o que é trabalhar em equipe, lideres e encarregados são ex operadores que foram promovidos, em geral por serem mais falsos e desunidos o que ajuda a tornar a empresa mais desarmoniosa, o melhor desta empresa são os benefícios gerados ( salario, plr, planos de saúde, transporte, e vale refeição)"
bad,autoliv was a face pace production facility with a great lean and 5's program
bad,"Management is rude to operators and treats them like garbage. No one reports injuries because they get treated even more like garbage. I was told I was no longer able to do something because I was distracting. It isnt my fault if supervisors and operators come talk to me. However its okay for people that aren't Autoliv, but through QCS to talk and distract operators on lines. Its absolute bull. I love the people I work with but the supervisor and their supervisor are rude to everyone under them."
bad,"Autoliv is a good company but the Ogden one has been ran into the ground. Favoritism is real and management does nothing about the hostile work environment. If racism, belittling, and being physically threatened doesn't bother you, than you'll be fine. The pay is mediocre, (you can make 13$/hr ANYWHERE) but the benefits are pretty good (40hrs personal time, 7hrs per month vacation, the option to buy 40 more hours of vacation, and 3 incentive hours every month and they offer decent insurance & retirement plans. The work is tedious, make a good playlist and keep your headphones in all day and you'll be fine."
bad,salaire pas approprier pour faire les week-end et des qu'on et mie dans un horaire a la journée on me tourne plu
bad,People rarely get promoted as managers have old pensions that keep them from leaving until they retire.  They just move people around but no one ever up.
bad,Självgående personal med ett stort kvalitetstänkande. Med facit i handen så har det varit ett företag som har kommit långt när det gäller att få med personalen på tåget när det gäller kvalitet och förbättringsarbete.
bad,les employés n'aident pas au mieux les apprentis ou stagiaires
bad,"Good pay, good environment, they didn’t treat they workers fair and they rushed you a lot. The coworkers are picky and very hard to work by at times and a lot of unnecessary  conflict."
bad,En lo que a mi respecta le aria falta un mejoramiento de salario y promover mas a gente con habilidades
bad,"It pays good, but tha'ts about the only good thing! The managers are all too worried about getting themselves in trouble, so they are unfair to their employees."
bad,es una empresa donde me desarrolle. mucho en lo profesional.
good,"Foarte multe sedinte fara rost"
good,"recibir indicaciones de nuestras actividades"
good,i lived and  worked in Mexico after the company transfered production from tilbury coordinating the process transfer i was terminated as soon as job was completed
good,"poor management, bad moral, On your feet for 8 hrs. and moving, hard on body.  trained on lots of good things. didn't really practice what they taught."
good,It was fun working there and learning how the air bags go together and function in a car.
good,I retired after four years with an incredibly incompetent manager.  I believe he was intimidated as I was the lead technical officer in the company. I was never so happy to leave and begin to enjoy my retirement.
good,Mi-a plăcut foarte mult activitatea desfășurată în cadrul companiei.
good,"Need to improve on Worst HR people and policies. Work culture in CAD also required, much load on experience people. Main complaint on HR policies and worst cost saving activities"
good,"Aprendi tudo que se faz na linha de produção,a operar as maquinas de costura, a maquina de solda,a fazer o set up da linha,os colegas de trabalho como em todos os lugares sempre tem alguns que querem ser mais na maioria tudo gente boa de trabalhar,os lideres que foram indicados e não os que passaram na prova de seleção quanto a parte da gerencia não ha oportunidade de melhorar de cargo ,o ambiente de trabalho apesar de se trabalhar de pé muito bom para se trabalhar"
good,"Des projets intéressants dans un environnement de travail sympa. Beaucoup d'implication personnelle pour pallier à des process nombreux avec des lacunes au niveau ""Système"". La capitalisation du savoir faire mériterait d'être conciliée au travers de la documentation des systèmes qui est à mettre en place et développer. Le savoir de cette entreprise repose majoritairement sur les personnes. Beaucoup de matière donc à ""dumper"" dans des documents Systèmes."
good,"Ganas bien pero tienes que quedarte , no hay tiempo extra."
good,Era linha de produção era bem corrido.Trabalhei pouco Tempo
good,"Ok Place to work if you can handle a lot of poor management.  There are a few good managers but the team leads are mostly, self centered and are unwilling to do anything above and beyond their own tasks, including helping Associates learn and build your own performance. Somewhat hard to advance unless you kiss butt or know people."
good,Es una empresa que otorga buenas prestaciones y las metas de operación de la gerencia son muy buenas pero las personas que tienen que aplicarlas en las áreas de producción no les dan el seguimiento adecuado
good,"Was pretty boring/repetitive night shift management was pretty useless, Compensation was decent pay and benefits"
good,"Solid company with a good product and positive attitude, but a negative work environment at this location because of 'good old boy' management style. Croneyism was quite prevalent. Long hours and shifts added to the stress of feeling no way to improve ones situation in company."
good,Tiszta legkor.. Konnyu fizikai allo munka. Embere valogatja
good,"No hay valanceo entre trabajo y vida personal, pésimo ambiente de trabajo"
good,"poste usant : gestes répétitifs."
good,"Lipsa de motivatie, lipsa de ore suplimentare, salariul mic de incadrare, stres continuu,"
good,Poor communication with employees and health insurance and benefits. The whole job was easy but if you're not fit and can't stand for 8 hours not the job for you. Need to be able to lift about 30 pounds continuously for different departments in the factory during 8 hours shifts.
good,Un empleo con mucha presion pero sin motivavion econimica.
good,Work Place is Good But There is Some Partiality in plant by some management guys. Confirmation chances is too poor.No job security it name is only MNC but culture is worst than an Indian company.
good,"entreprise sans évolution de carrière pour un intérimaire , et avec une mauvaise organisation des planning ."
good,"wear esd"
good,İşlerimiz her zaman çok yoğundu ama artı yönlerinin olması o yoğunluğu her zaman geride bıraktı.
good,"My typical day consists of the usual general administrative assistant work but on a global level. I communicate with other Autoliv employees from Germany, Sweden, China on a daily basis via email and Lync.  Extensive travel arrangements are made, reports updated, new hires' work stations set up and training arranged.  Expense reports take up a large part of the work week.  I fill in for the receptionist.  Filing and archiving files are dealt with. "
good,travail de chaines pour plusieurs poste dans cette usine et un rythme très soutenu
good,"Was okay for the first little while, then the only thing that kept me there for so long was the pay and insurance benefits. Also the gainshare was nice every quarter that we qualified for one."
good,It’s a fast paced and often politically motivated workplace. The benefits were great while my job had flexible hours. I recommend working here in the right position
good,"It is a nice place to work but the workloads is so much. I have to work 10 to 12 hours per day and some weekends. "
good,Management and HR is horrible. They don't treat people by standards. Good pay but the environment is horrible. I would never work there again. Not worth the stress.
good,Le produit développé est très intéressant de par sa complexité.
good,Production is very repetitive but its cool to think you are building something to save a life. Unless you have a college degree you won't get above production.
good,"In the test group, you have no insight to new designs.  Nothing is well documented in the company and you spend most of your time being a private investigator between engineering and production.  Documents are written just to ""color in the the box"" company wide and most detailed info is passed and defined by email and yellow stickies.  Very piecemeal, and ""cowboy"" engineering.  Management is aware of the culture but no real attempt is made to correct it - ""its our culture and that's the way it is"" attitude.  Managers are ""namby pamby"" to some engineers to the point where the staff is allowed to be so lax in documentation, that they will not be forced to improve (and risk the engineer leaving), so management is afraid of culture change and some engineers hold the company in check because they don't share the knowledge - leading to undeserved job security and even worse documentation and collaboration. A downward spiral which may have been the cause of the active safety division being split off reticently from the corporation"
good,"calibrate machines and start testing parts"
good,"In production control, it was an extremely stressful job. I had lost fifteen pounds within the first month of working there from the physical labor. It seemed as though that upper management didn't really care about the concerns of employees, as they tried to cut down on people and build up production the work load became near unbearable. Although it seemed that supervisors did try to make a difference there was not much they could do. With this happening there was also an increase in workplace injuries, and within the time I was there nothing was done about it. Overall though, at the end of the day I had a sense of completion and overall satisfied, if management could try harder to fix the problems  that occur, it would be an excellent place to work."
good,falta darle creciminto al personal   hay muchas personas estundindo y no hay oportunudad de crecinmto
good,Autoliv has good benefits and pays better than most jobs. the work takes a tole on your body after a couple of years and advancing is hard. Production depends on the customer demand and the management is not really involved with its employees
good,"Os dias de trabalho costumam ser normais e repetitivos o que te leva a aprender de forma bem fácil o trabalho, e ainda ajuda a aprender muitas coisas, eu por exemplo aprendi muito sobre como funciona uma empresa e também aprendi muito em trabalho de equipe e por isso acredito que me dei bem pois faço amizades de maneira fácil."
good,on s'installe devant notre poste de travail des 6h15 une pause de 15 mn fin de journée 13h.
good,Automotive industry - do more with less. Not enough sick/personal time is allocated per year but the vacation and holiday schedule is generous - just don't get sick.
good,"Es un excelente lugar para aprender acerca sus diferentes sistemas de producción. Autoliv se preocupa por educar a todos sus empleados, sin excepción, en su sistema laboral. "
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, aprendes varios procesos"
good,Autoliv es una excelente empresa de clase mundial sin embargo el requerimiento es mayor a la capacidad por lo tanto en un ambiente muy absorvente y deja poco tiempo para un equilibrio de vida personal.
good,"Typical day on the production floor was fast-paced. If you're one of the lucky few to be on a line that doesn't work on weekends then great, but most lines work at least one weekend a month and my line unfortunately worked every weekend at least a day. They don't care that you're tired or that you have a life because it is mandatory overtime. Office employees get every Friday off while some lines (like mine) work up to 28 days in a row. If you have a problem it gets tossed around, everyone blaming everyone else. They encourage kaizens, 8D's and new ideas but they don't follow up and then the line gets in trouble for not meeting monthly goals. It is always the production associates fault, never management, never the engineers. If something needed fixing it got fixed in two months and we the production associates had to deal with it working with flawed machines 8 hours a day for weeks or even months. AMG's and AMC's don't care about their AMT's or production workers. Some don't even know how a line runs, they go to the production floor and have no idea what a machine does or what the process consists of. Temp agency employees have no work ethic or work experience and we were expected to cater to them. We could not tell them to hurry not even a little. I didn't want to be working another weekend but all we could do is stand and wait for them. If they complain then we got in trouble because we have to be nice to them even though work does not get done. Work culture is changing due to this new rule, lots of teenagers, lots of drama, lots of bullying and unprofessionalism. The conversations"
good,Arbeta 2 och 2 på olika stationer. Min uppgift var att köra kretskort genom stora maskiner där komponenter skulle limmas och sedan undersökas.
good,"Management always tries to work with you if you need a day off, very friendly and fast pace so the day goes by super fast and the best part is that you get off at 2."
good,"Don't treat there workers very well. Will work them to the bone. Mandatory overtime. Good pay however. Days, swings, and graves shifts. Fast paced work."
good,"megalázó,a munkaerőt a végsőkig kiaknázó vezetőség,teljes intolerancia a betegállományban levő dolgozók iránt!"
good,"The repetitiveness of the job made it easy to work. however, you usually had to work long hours forced overtime or there were not enough to do and they send you home. Projections were always off especially around holidays, so just plan to have to work when you were told you would be off. as long as you could hit quotas and keep machines running you are pretty much left allow. They make a lot of promises but don't keep them"
good,I have learned a lot by being employed by Autoliv. It was my first 'real' job after high-school and I was able to learn so many skills both in production and overall workplace relationships. The pay is wonderful and I really can't complain.
good,"I do multitasking job. From material planning, procurement, warehousing and shipping. The job was a great challenge for me that I spent most of my time in the workplace. Job Work/Life balance is not suitable anymore for me. With the years of doing  the routine jobs, I find myself so drained physically and mentally. I was so disappointed when I left my job that they hired at least 6 personnel to do my work."
good,"Great place to work safety comes first however the hours can be stressful. There have been times where you will not get a day off at all for months and other times you won't have work come through at all. It's not the securest job as far as work goes but it pays fair for what you do and the culture is nice, and they do pay their overtime hours."
good,"Good Work "
good,"Entreprise en évolution,marché conquis dans le secteur équipementier."
good,"Working with explosives all day, this is not a job for nervous people.The pay is good but it takes a few years to top out. Managers favor the supervisors but don't listen to their employees."
good,"L'activité est intéressante par la diversité des process, les exigences qualité qui motivent les support de production sur la maîtrise des process."
good,"for the 3 first months i worked 2 shift and after that i worked the night shift. i learned to be fast and learn a lot of new things quick."
good,"Empresa Multinacional com Política Sólida, bom ambiente de trabalho, colegas solícitos e ótima equipe multidisciplinar."
good,"O dia de trabalho é realizado sob muita pressão precisando fazer muitas tarefas ao mesmo momento. Muitos funcionários não respeitam as conversas já começadas entre outros funcionários interrompendo-as. Os horários das reuniões marcadas raramente são cumpridos. A gerência/diretoria exerce pressão e poucas vezes define claramente o objetivo a ser atingido, sendo que as tarefas devem ser repetidas para realizar correções. É muito difícil lograr as mudanças internas sendo que fica mais fácil uma negociação com fornecedores. O clima de trabalho é agradável embora o lugar físico seja muito barulhento não permitindo em muitas oportunidades lograr ter comunicações telefónicas ou teleconferências eficazes."
good,"Oferece muitas oportunidades de interação com outras culturas, o ambiente de trabalho é agradável e o produto é muito bom!"
good,Was a good learning experience. Flexible Work environment no timing constraints. Helpful colleagues.
good,Uma empresa com bom ambiente de trabalha com oportunidade de aprendizagem.
good,"Vi har varit fyra trainee under utbildningen men efter detta är ingen av oss kvar på Autoliv, dags att börja tänka annorlunda kanske."
good,Horarios de trabajo muy estrictos y no son tolerantes a otras necesidades del trabajador
good,Autoliv is a good company to work for. I love the people I work with. they have a good atmosphere and they have great benefits. you can work good hours with no worries
good,Engelli emekli oldum ayrılmak zorunda kaldım tekrar devam ettirmediler  çok istedim olmadı
good,The company is ok can't complain but I need a change and growth...and as people we need to grow bigger and better and look for greener pastures.i would like to go to another company to gain other skills
good,"Work was tough, but fair. Perfect to get you into a mindset of working, or if you need a job quick. Mind you, It's not something viable if you're not willing to put in the work. But even then, as apart of QCS, you could still be treated poorly while doing everything right. This is what usually drives people away."
good,"Years ago this company out-shined all others within the manufacturing arena.  However, with Global take over, it is no longer the premier place to work.  With the change in management structures and policies, the company has forgotten to take care of the production workers who make the products.  Associates feel they are no longer valued or appreciated for their hard work and dedication."
good,"An obnoxious Co-worker I had the displeasure to meet. He harassed me constantly and it made focusing really hard. In an environment where you have to remain sharp, it was hard due to the relationship that some of the guys have built. If you don't like direct drama I wouldn't recommend this place. Rough on new forklift drivers, you learn really quick how to drive fast and not be in the experienced drives way."
good,The office I was based in is no longer there as it was closed and all functions moved abroad to various countries. It was a pleasant place to work when I was there
good,"Autoliv was a very matured well set up system. Building airbag parts for cars. This company has a well built in system for production workers who can stand in one position for up to 8Hrs. And 30 mins, and also repetitive tasks."
good,"Very fast pace stressful environment.   Lots of OT,  We once worked 7 days a week for 3 months straight.  To much gossip among employees and favoritism among supervisors"
good,"Work Conditions were horrible when I was last there. Broken equipment. No water coolers. Facilities were often blocked off for one reason or another, Get better."
good,very repetitive work. will work 7 days a week on a last minute notice. management worked best they could. good people despite very hard work conditions. pay was decent. benefits were mediocre. could move up in the company if you could handle the hard work load.
good,"It is a great job IF you are cut out for it. I used to work here and everything about the job is fine, I just personally did not look far into it and ended up with  carpal tunnel"
good,"I was only an employee for a short time, but while I was there it was enjoyable. My job required me to be alone in a room with machines to maintain."
good,"A day at the office was a standard sit at your desk getting your work done. On occasion a special project would be brought up and then your work became involved with others in a team. Working here taught me good teamwork skills and many software and programming skills on multiple projects. The management of the company was very well-handled, and co-workers were always easy to approach and ask for assistance."
good,"quality control inspection. i had a different job almost every night. I learned a lot at this job. co workers were always willing and ready to help if needed, but very aware they had their own job to do. Management made very sure you knew what you were doing and always close by if you had questions"
good,"Un buen aprendizaje en los distintos departamentos de la empresa, que desembocaron en el área Logística, sobre todo en la atención al cliente donde viví gratas experiencias"

good,"Really long days in a noisy environment with crass and rough co-workers. The management was terrible, not warning workers about changes to the setup of the production floor. Exhausting."
good,"empresa multinacional que zela pela total segurança dos seus clientes, com funcionários altamente capacitados para a execução dos diversos tipos de trabalhos exigidos pela empresa."
good,I worked an assembly line making air bag inflator. The job wasn't hard but the tasks were making it so I was beginning to get the symptoms for carpal tunnel.
good,empresa automotive muito bem conceituada infelizmente tive q sair devido a mudanca para curitiba
good,"Not a lot of employee rights. Most of the Production people were unhappy. It was a good group of people trying to make a living. High stress environment, but great when you got a piece of equipment up and running."
good,if you like making tooling this is a great job for you. Lots of equipment to use after hours.
good,"Produção e qualidade, muita atenção aos produtos pois estão voltados a segurança automotiva. Otimos colegas de trabalho. Falta um pouco de instrução aos Líderes e Supervisores."
good,"Por se tratar de uma autopeça, o dia de trabalho é dinâmico e sob pressão. Aprendi a cumprir prazos de cronogramas de projeto sem nenhum atrasdo, planejar as atividades e seguir certas tarefas rotineiras. A direção e a gerência são bastante próximos dos funcionários, mas acredito que falta um pouco de reconhecimento dos objetivos atingidos por estes. Os colegas e o ambiente de trabalho é ótimo e com pessoas dispostas a te ajudar."
good,"Fácil  relacionamento com todos os níveis hierárquicos;"
good,Follow detailed work instructions for select product that is needed to be inspected for possible defects and damage.  The day-to-day inspections vary because of the rotation of employees to ensure fresh eyes are looking at the product.  Must be able to work individually and as a team.  Some inspections require team effort where others are done individually.
good,"Empresa de grande porte não possui um sistema de promoção aos funcionários que já estão a li, preferem dar oportunidade para quem esta fora (pessoas novas)."
good,I was an airbabg inspector. Management was good. Co-workers were friendly. This was a good job.
good,The major problem with my role at Autoliv was no potential for advancement and too many people don't want to put much effort in for improvement if it's too much work.
good,"Autoliv production system= TPS+lean...you will learn a lot of safety and seatbelt tec, work under pressure, it's a really good place to work. It is a global company, all the plants are standardize and they work as one."
good,"Autoliv is a great place to work if you are single and don't need to provide for others or want much free time. They work you very hard and more often than not expect you to work many hours of Mandatory overtime. The work is  stupidly simple and I would rather you my brain a little more during a job. The pay is wonderful for a starting position however, and the benefits are quite good."
good,Great company for engineers. Autoliv has very little in the way of career options for commercial roles. Compensation is not competitive with market rates.
good,"İşyerinde gün içerisinde oldukça hareketli geçen bir tempomuz oluyor. Dizayn ekibi ile toplantılarımız, hatta denemelerimiz sonucu paylaşımlarımız , ürün kontrolleri yapılıyor."
good,"AutoLiv bought in and started downsizing.  I was cut this morning."
good,"I am currently employed at the Ogden facility, which is the module facility. You are assigned to a particular production line making airbags. It is fast paced, and can be overwhelming at times. Depending on which area of the facility you are in, will depend on just how overwhelming it is. The production floor is all relatively easy. The hardest part for me is not the work itself, but the lack of communication between the unnecessarily large amount of supervisors, managers, & interns in every department. Which is often a direct result of downtime on the production line, causing the line to miss the monthly goals to no fault of their own. Benefits are good. Dental, Medical, Anonymous distress hotline, 401k match. Quarterly bonuses for all associates, pending the performance of all the facilities in the region. Paid holidays, 40 Hrs personal, and monthly accrued vacation which will rollover to the next calendar year."
good,"The managers at this place are very easy and fun to work with. The environment is great. The hours are really long which is not always great, but they are lenient on days off."
good,"Not a lot of comments about the company. It's seems like a good company. You don't expect to come in a start to know everything on your own? training, training, training will keep the new employee confidence to be in a company."
good,when I started I loved Autoliv it was an amazing job but over the years the culture changed with new management and it became a place I really couldn't see myself working at for the rest of my career.
good,Joint Venture ilişkisi ile uluslarası ortamda çalışma imkanı buldum. Otomotiv sektörünü tanıdım.
good,Good place to work if you can keep your job there. Autoliv suffers from the same management problems that plague many companies but I would recommend it as a decent place to work.
good,"This is a Swedish MNC company manufacturing vehicle safety products like Airbags, Seat belts and steering wheels. The company is very particular about compliance which is a very good thing. There are lots of global standards which help to maintain standard process. Overall it is very good company to work."
good,"Quando eu entrei na empresa era muito boa de trabalhar ou melhor ate eu sair ainda era."
good,"The pay is good,and the people there are OK if you can handle a little stress. The benefits are worth the trouble. And the rate of getting a promotion is rare."
good,"É possível conciliar a vida pessoal com a profissional, porém empresa vinha passando por instabilidade gerada pela crise do ramo automotivo. "
good,Je voudrais  reprendre le travail apres m’avoir occuper de mes 4 enfants

good,"maneja una cultura laboral muy amplia de criterio, empresa joven que dia con dia esta detras de la mejora continua."
good,"Fast paced, very good compensation and benefits.  Went from 12s to 8s with promise of 5 day work week. Most weeks are 6 days. More of who you know not what you know culture."
good,Over all it is a good place to work.  Just like other places there are people with integrity and those with none.  If you do well and show you want to learn you will be treated with respect.  Workplace culture depends on who you make friends with.
good,"This is a good place to work, if you don't mind a job that is very repetitive.  They do pay very well, and also have great benefits."
good,Was great up until the union took over. Major loss of jobs. Don't feel secure there at all...favouritism is huge. Co-workers were great fun though.
good,"Autoliv is very good at giving additional training and growing their workforce.  They continue to have good medical benefits however they have declined slightly during the economic challenges.  Autoliv is the leader in lean manufacturing and fortunately I have been able to take advantage of that.  I have made many friends at Autoliv and would hope that if I were to go elsewhere we would be able to maintain those friendships."
good,"This is mostly my personal opinion, and how it wasn't a good job - for me. "
good,"Typical day for me would be handing out work assignments, managing work flow of all employees in the warehouse, and assisting the head warehouse manager. "
good,"Se trabaja con le factor humano  tomando en cuenta la seguridad y  como primordial la seguridad de los trabajadores de planta aprendí a relacionarme con los clientes en un buen ambiente de trabajo estable amigable ya que es una empresa que busca el ambiente laborar sano para sus empleados. "
good,"During the time that I and my wife worked there, they did not always follow OSHA standards and were quick to lay off employees during any sized down-turn."
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar,com gestores preocupados com produção e qualidade e funcionários,cliente,Higiene, Saúde e Meio Ambiente."
good,"I really liked having my supervisor while I was there. He was a really good supervisor to have! Really friendly co-workers, made quite a few friend's while working there. Just everyone I know that I'm really good friends or family with lrft there an I see why that place just isn't for me."
good,its easy and a fast moving work place! you're on a time schedule while being a tugger and a lot of heavy lifting but in all its not a bad place to work for
good,"I worked here for awhile, I was paid well, decent benefits, but new bosses keep adjusting the rules to control you like a robot."
good,All days were pretty much the same. Ive learned about the product and how it can save lives. Management was mostly concerned how numbers. On grave yard shift i loved all my co workers. The hardest part of the job was having to be super fast.. I enjoyed my friends.
good,A typical day at work I get there on time and start setting up the production line. I learned how important quality really is when assembling an airbag. Management is good but I do not see them very much. My co-workers are great and we all get along and joke around. The hardest part of my job is when we fall behind because there is a lack of material. This can be stressful knowing you need to work even harder to make up parts. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. They are great and fun to work with.
good,todo muy equilibrado respecto a la administracion y en los distintos departamentos de la empresa
good,"Un mediu de lucru  placut, cu colegi de treaba si punctualitate."
good,"Nesta fabrica aprendi a trabalhar na linha propriamente dita,pois até então somente operava maquinas"

good,Productive and learn a lot of great safety experiences. The hardest part was problems with the machine. The most enjoyable part were the lasting friendships that were made and working as a team
good,"* Challenging work for this kind of company, monitor all parts daily, weekly and monthly. And the hardest part for this job is, when you have bad parts deliver to customer."
good,A empresa não dá muita chances para o operador de estudar e evoluir profissionalmente.
good,Not my idea place to work.Management was scattered and changed frequently. Processes broke under stress and caused confusion and efficiency reduction due to change.
good,"Autoliv  é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar,ambiente agradavel"
good,"Overall, great company to work for, with good to great benefits.  Company is set-up for a successful launch, and generally supports all members of the team.  Purchasing management on the other hand doesn't support the buyers.  Management is completely inflexible regarding flexible schedules(work from home is rare).  Global calls are mandatory, but you must maintain your 8-5 hours, no matter how late or early you supported your global project."
good,"I worked there for several years and no matter what, I was never moved up. I feel that with the time I put in and the dedication that I showed, being passed over made me look for employment elsewhere."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, muitas pessoas boas de se conviver e trabalhar junto."
good,"Overall, working at autoliv on the production side was a great experience. However, being in the pyro side really had a lot of downfalls. The schedule is not meant for a single parent with little to no help.. especially on a grave schedule."
good,I make air bag for vehicles on a assembly line it is fun. you some part  all night I work with 6 other worker on the some line
good,"Terrible management my Team lead was playing favorites in the process of advancing,  the younger employees got all of the promotions.  I've had Supervisor experience and it didn't seem to matter to him at all.  He seemed to be a little prejudice because I wasn't a member of the church ofJesus Christ of Latter day saints"
good,I loved the people I got to work with.  Not much room for advancement or wrk enough pay. I wish I got paid my worth and a little less mandatory over time.
good,"co workers became family. when I worked there they had all different clubs. golf club, basketball leagues and all sorts of different tournaments for the employees."
good,"A typical day is like any other over worked and underpaid. Management lack the ability or will to communicate properly with the employees on the floor, who actually make the products. The most enjoyable part of the day was break and lunches because you were able to talk to friends and co-workers."
good,"No tempo em que colaborei aprendi que todo o processo desde o mais simples até o mais complexo são exercidos com seriedade e responsabilidade, como atua no setor de segurança pude ver que trabalham para que seja produzido um produto eficaz e seguro, assim alcançando as metas propostas de modo que nossos clientes ficassem satisfeitos."
good,"Good MNC company"
good,"I am working in three shifts. Here i learned to work in team,to pay attention to details and to be a better and a clever human. My co-workers are also good friendsmeach of them having good skils in what are we doing. The hardest part of the job is the safety because we work with dangerous goods and 8 hours/day we need to be 100% focused at what are we doing."
good,"Chega um momento que o dia de trabalho é rotineiro sempre a mesmas coisas não que eu não tenha interesse de aprender algo novo, mas, as oportunidades são limitadas não dá para entender. Mesmo não tendo faltas a promoção não vem. Nesses quatros anos de empresa aprendi muitas coisas principalmente lhe dar com pessoas, porque, depender de pessoas para cumprir com as metas do dia não é fácil, então aprendi lhe dar com essas situações."
good,"Can not really say anything bad about Autoliv whiling working there. There's a reason that they are such a well respected company. However, like any business, they do have room to improve when it comes to the different divisions working together."
good,"Muito bom trabalhar na Autoliv,porem tem muita coisa para mudar no local"

good,"this is the same company as Veoneer, this was however where I started out learning the purchasing world and developed the skills that I have today, was more of a family feel when it was still Autoliv."
good,"Autoliv was an alright company to work for. They are pretty strict and there isn't much variation, you have to stay in your tiny area doing the same thing all day every day."
good,"Most people are rude if you’re slow, is hard but n your hands and is what I consider a fly trap they pay just enough so you can’t leave and to get a better position you need to be a favorite of the higher ups"
good,Autoliv India Management is reactive and not proactive. They need a push every time. Looks like they are out of focus. HR policies are not employee friendly.

good,"Could use better machinery, eg. The machinery would break for no reason because of its age and it's up to you to try and figure out whays wronf with it. If it was something out of your hands you'd have to call down a maintenance crew. overall a decent workplace environment. Machinery"
good,I can only speak for the Brigham City location and it was a great job with an acceptable wage but nothing competitive.. but the Mgmt was not always the friendliest nor were they supportive of their teams.

good,"Good Working Environment. "
good,"Autoliv é uma empresa nova que está no Brasil há 15 anos, precisa se estruturar um pouco mais, se organizar  e será uma grande empresa. No dia a dia na minha área é extremamente estressante pois trabalhamos com muito risco devido a varias áreas que interferem em nosso trabalho, um exemplo foi a greve do porto no ano de 2013, outro exemplo é: deferimento de licenças de importação e  lidar com constantes atrasos de fornecedores. Minha gerencia é extremamente profissional e trata o funcionário com muita educação, nós subordinados conversamos e tratamos de assuntos profissionais de igual para igual. Hoje depois de 14 anos na Autoliv do Brasil acredito que me transformei eu uma profissional preparada para o que eu faço. (Planejar e Coordenar materiais). A parte mais difícil do meu trabalho é realmente lidar com o stress do dia a dia com risco eminente de ruptura por influencia externas, e chegar a afetar o cliente (coisa que nunca me aconteceu). Meu relacionamento com meus colegas de trabalho é muito profissional e amigável nunca tivemos problemas de relacionamento. A parte agradável que acredito ser de todas as áreas é ir embora com a sensação de ter feito um bom trabalho.  Hoje procuro uma nova colocação no mercado para renovar meus conhecimento e também aumentar minha renda."
good,"Management was not good to work with. They refused to do anything about the work life balance. They work you 12 days in a row and then you get 2 days off and then back to the 12 days schedule. The only ones that would only have to work 5 days in a row were the office stall and engineering techs, friends of the management."

good,I stayed there for 3 years.
good,"Daily work starts with a team meeting. "
good,"Its a well paying job...if you can schedule it. I worked swing shift, 2 to 10, and the only reason I left was I was starting college. Its VERY monotonous, a few different actions repeated over and over for 8 hours. If you can handle that, then it's worth the pay."
good,L’entreprise bien une bon travail d’équipe et une bonne formation par les chefs
good,"The best part of the job was the people, I enjoyed working with them. I enjoyed my job in maintenance and found my job challenging and always with something new to learn."
good,"It was a challenging job for me, it is because the compensation from the company was not enough. Although the management was great but the kind of work i had there is quite difficult because of the lack of orders from our client from that time."
good,"Autoliv was fast pace air bag manufacturing plant"
good,This is a good place to work if your are looking to make it a career and move up in the company. They pay for school and promote from within. As long as you intend to get off the ground level on the production floor. You will do well here. However there are people there who where promoted to a trainer or AMT (shift lead) simply because there was no better option. Although there is plenty opportunities to move up and make a great living with this company. There are also many who have never moved up or tried to better their career. Many of these workers are under the opinion that they don't need to do the job as well as they should or as well as the rest of their co-workers. Simply because they have been there for several years. There are also some who do as little as possible to try and ensure they fall behind in their shift demand (parts they are expected to build each shift). So that they will work overtime on the weekends. Being that it is an assembly line job. Dropping parts or failing to meet shift demand causes many people on multiple shifts to come in on their days off. Nothing is ever done to prevent this.
good,Good place to learn and nice colleagues to work with. Good HR Practices and very strong HR Team. Working on cutting edge technologies and one of the Tier 1 suppliers.
good,very repetitive management was lacking did not care about their employees.  not to much advancement.  safety was not number one numbers were. I come to find out it was all about how cheap they could make an airbag. they sent some of the work to mexico for cheap labor
good,Es un buen empleo con buenas prestaciones solo el ambiente laboral no es muy bueno
good,"I loved that job, I honestly didn't get why people said it was hard or to fast, it was simple but it had its days where it did run fast, But I worked there long enough to know where the material went so it wasn't to bad."
good,"Autoliv is a good place to start out as an engineer or technician. they are willing to accept newer Graduates of degrees and certificates so you can get a job fresh out of school. The pay however may be a little lower for someone without experience. the environment and benefits are good, and they will pay for 100 percent of school if its a degree that benefits the company."
good,"Posibilități de carieră , cantină subvenționată 50% , cabinet medical în firmă , condiții de muncă bune , curățenie ."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of manual labor, lifting materials up to 50 lbs and moving them from one spot to another and repetitive motion. I learned how to work as a team with the people in my area and on other shifts, how to train new associates, talk to and with customers and to communicate about any and all production activities that were done, such as: number of parts produced in the shift, and machine problems that had occurred and if there were any quality concerns. Management was generally easy to get ahold of, but couldn't always resolve things due to their busy schedules.The culture was constant changing, the idea of the culture is to continuously improve everything we did. The most difficult part of the job was training new associates to the standards and processes so they could be independent in their work if/when necessary.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new ways to help show people our processes and meet new people everyday."
good,"Normal working day is 7.5 hours. Two 10 mins breaks and a 30 mins lunch. "
good,It was a good job. Couldn't move up in the company without being a suck up. Topped out within 3 years of being there. Make their employers work hard for bad pay.

good,"Working at Autoliv (as an engineer), I had the freedom to design how I want. As a result I was able to learn a lot of information very quickly. Management there was very helpful in giving me resources that would help me improve. I felt that the workplace environment was very comfortable. What I enjoyed most, as mentioned before, was that I had the freedom to design how I want. This makes your day a lot more pleasant, because the work you perform in way becomes a part of you."
good,"Autoliv provided many advancement opportunities, pays for school, and has an amazing benefits package. The culture is very much stereotypical ""Utah"", you will definitely hear about the boy scouts, church, church callings, and testimonies bared on a daily basis. I was able to look past this and these were some of the greatest guys I have ever worked with."
good,"Meetings with customers about specific changes or testing with in their in-house application. I also spent a lot of time testing the new or modified application with the programmer. I enjoyed working with the customer. The workplace culture was very team oriented. The hardest part of my job was  trying to analyze the cost of an application for continued IT support, How much support would they need vs. putting a price tag on it vs. changes they would make on the fly."
good,"Uma fábrica multinacional que está crescendo muito porém esquece do principal, os operadores. Sem planos reais de carreira e oportunidades a partir de um processo seletivo real.

good,"company is extremely diverse. Able to interact with numerous of people on a daily basis. Does not over work you, management understand the intensity of the position."
good,Everyday is a challenge in a manufacturing environment with always never ending improvements to do. Since the company is also into multi tasking of roles thus you have to excel in both expectations which is not an easy task to do both.

Once that was complete you would go to your station and make sure you had all of your tools needed for the day. Then you would grab the parts and inspect, overall it was good work. Then after the shift was over if you were finished with your parts the supervisor would ask to help sweep the floors and help others finish so the other shift would have a easy start up for their day."

Several times we would take a field trip to another Autoliv location and learn about the product they were producing. I learned the extreme importance of wearing a seat belt along with having an airbag, and how they work together. The importance of making the product right the first time and how to avoid any injury. The management were always eager to show their appreciation to the production associates through incentives, time served awards to serving a Thanksgiving dinner. The hardest part of the job would have to be helping out in another area and getting up to speed with the team. Working for autoliv, I had a sense of stability, perfect hours while raising my daughter and knowing how to make a quality, life saving device. Autoliv was or is an awesome company."
