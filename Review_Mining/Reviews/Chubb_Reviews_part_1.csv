rating,review
bad,"Awful management. Terrible management, horrible management, no structure, no one really knows what’s going on. Did I mention terrible leadership  after the merge company went down hill employees paid poorly."
bad,"los empleados externos no son valorados solo son un número más y un robot que hay que exprimir para sacar toda la ventaja posible, hacen promesas falsas con tal de retener al empleado... no importa que éstos son personas humanas y tienen vida afuera,  los jefes son prepotentes y ponen encima los intereses (no saben decir NO)  Y aun en temas que están fuera de un alcance del área sacrificando los tiempos ya programados y las tareas asignadas,  y muchas veces sacrifican los tiempos del empleado, ocasionando que este trabaje fuera de horario y gratis...  Los lideres en el área de IT Soporte de Aplicaciones Mexico / LATAM   no son los adecuados, hasta que cambien de mentalidad, seguirán teniendo una elevada rotación de empleados externos, como hasta hoy..."
bad,"Chubb was bought out a few years ago from  ACE insurance, since then the company went down.  It became a stressful environment and high turnover rate."
bad,"terrible place now.  "
bad,"unsozialer und ungerechtfertigter Druck gegenüber Mitarbeitern, Inkompetenz der Führungskräfte teilweise"
bad,Joining the company on the first day was a sad moment as i was left out to do things independently and without any guides or help from fellow peers or management. We were only told to do and we must do it no matter what situation we are facing even if safety is compromise.
bad,"I took voluntary redundancy as I was desperate to leave after nearly 10 years of working there. "
bad,"Prior to the M&A by Ace, Chubb was a great place to work.  It wasn't perfect but people had an opportunity to grow and thrive.  The toughest part of joining Chubb was getting into the culture and becoming part of the family.  There was a family, outsiders just needed to grow into it.   "
bad,Awful place to work as a developer after the merger with Ace Insurance.   They replaced too many experienced staff with temp consultants so all the subject matter expertise is missing creating a huge roadblock to getting anything done.
bad,This company no longer exists. It was purchased by another insurance company.  The culture changed the last few years of my employment at Chubb and it just didn't have the quality workmanship for which it was known.
bad,"I worked for Chubb Agribusiness and I have to say it was the worst experience I have ever had. I was the first associate they hired through a company wide program and boy they were unprepared. There was no instruction given at all and most of my days were filled reading books instead of on the job learning. There were some days I had no instruction despite asking multiple times."
bad,Unorthodox.  Innapropriate.  Mismanaged.  Just an all around horrible place to work.  The worst job (Underwriting Associate) I have ever had in my life.
bad,"Very low. "
bad,"If you are not blond and white, please do not expect to get anything out of this company.."
bad,PRS (personal risk services) has terrible management. They will work you until you have nothing else. They don't appreciate their employees and there is no opportunity for growth or to move to another department.
bad,Management was controlling and abusive and lacked any compassion and empathy.  Widespread culture of oppression to minimize the possibility of bonuses.
bad,"Not even sure where to begin:"
bad,"High turn over and disorganized local manager.  Overall the computer system was good and always evolving."
bad,This company management is not dynamic. They have some employees that are willing to go the mile but no compensated. Management is partial to their friends.
bad,"It is hard to find technically competent claims management at ACE at this stage of the company's history. Sr. Management is much more concerned with solidifying power and protecting their political status within the organization then effectively adapting to challenges in industry. The ACE claims department has gone from an industry leader to chaos in a short time frame. Multiple redundant reports are still completed by front line claims staff due as much to incompetence as well as the need of members of the management team to carve out their own political sphere of influence. Vendors and business partners are measured not by their effectiveness but their willingness to appease management and their personal relationships with members of the management team."
bad,"No advancement, company doesn't support employees, pay is way below average.  The micro managing makes it a place that really has a depressing environment.  Some managers try to make it bearable"
bad,"No work/life balance.  Worked to death. “Old boys club” atmosphere... you’re either included or your not.  If your not included, miserable place to work"
bad,"I worked at this company for almost 2 years.  I came in with experience in the Workers compensation industry, so I was very familiar with jurisdictional and typical claims practices. I was hired to cover NC, VA and SC. Once I got there, I was given a totally different jurisdiction. This is not an issue, as I am up for learning new states, but I was given takeover claims from another TPA in the amount of 200 files! With no formal training of the systems and with no time to get familiar with the new jurisdiction!  It all went downhill from there. Management is very unprofessional. You have to be in the 'cool kid's' circle to get anywhere. I ultimately was given option to leave with severance and I took it.  This the most unprofessional place (and ethically questionable) I have ever encountered. Stay away if you value your career in WC."
bad,"This is more for the office in Simsbury, CT. The workload is extremely large, even for new hires. The management is not effective or helpful. You can easily work 12 hour days 7 days a week and still feel like you are not in a good place."
bad,"Favoritism is very rampant. The management has no ideal how to perform. They pick and choose their favorites. If you want a real job with grown ups, don't choose Chubb."
bad,"Management is not helpful"
bad,"My training was three day and there should have been more.The work load and things that are given to you with no training was not fair.Now you have to fine someone that does not mine to help you.There should be training on everything that you will be doing as you do you work flo,"
bad,"ACE Group was the most unprofessional place I have ever worked in my life. I am glad to have left. Stay away from ARCM in Wilmington terrible culture constant turnover and totally unprofessional management. Management is very hot and cold depending on how their day is going they may be nice or they may be just down right mean, this was how the whole department was from Managers and up not just mine. Stay away from this company."
bad,"Very unwelcoming environment. The office is very quiet and unsociable, the training is nearly non-existent and what little there is, it is outdated and does nothing to teach you the actual role. The environment is cold and unfriendly."
bad,Too much politics.  People have been around for 30+ years and do not show any professional etiquette for each other especially consultants.  STAY AWAY
bad,I would steer clear from joining this company at all costs.  The management does not care if you have obligations outside of work.  You are expected to drop everything and remain at work for as long as they feel it is necessary.
bad,"The training does not prepare you for the real job. The workload is huge. To keep up, you have to easily work 9/10 hour days."
bad,"The company was bought out and the culture has changed drastically. The company used to care about its employees but now with the new company they don’t, so I would not recommend working for them unless you want stress in your life."
bad,"como toda externo  solo buscan beneficiarse del recurso y exprimirlo al.maximo en IT,  no les importa el empleado ni su vida afuera de la empresa despues de su jornada, incluso exigiendo que te quedes mas de tu tiempo, "
bad,"Not that great, 50 better places to work. while dealing with horrible colleagues with an air of self entitlement. Dealing with management who didn't care about there staff, let alone complete there job. They constantly pulled a George Costanza, (pretended to be angry to look busy)"
bad,In the interview process I was advised that it would be only 4-5 claims per day and eventually bodily injury claims would be assigned later down the road with appropriate training. I had two informal weeks of training and was thrown out on the floor. One week after being assigned claims I was given bodily injury and premise claims with NO TRAINING AT ALL! About three weeks in we began to get 7-10 claims a day!! We were basically sold something in the interview to get us in the door and now we're stuck until we find something else.
bad,"It was a good working environment. It is a busy place, lots of things to do. I communicated a lot on the phone, email and via fax."
bad,"some are awesome, and some are a**Holes. they only care about deadlines and nothing else.  they want you to learn something new, you have no choice even you don't understand it."
bad,"The amount of work was ok. The a few of the adjusters i assisted were petty and impatient. Most time the assistants were given to many adjusters to keep up. And we mentioned this to the so called manager he did nothing about it. i ended up being laid off because of one person that wanted to complain about every little thing. I had a total of 10 adjusters and i was able to stay caught up. The main issue i had is the people that send you stuff you are not supposed to do and when you refuse the manager comes at you and will fire you. Also i was never given a company handbook stating the type of task i can and cannot complete. The list of tasks changed based on the complaints of the adjusters. The complaints of the assistants, were almost always ignored"
bad,Since the merger with ACE Chubb has forgotten the people who made them a great place to work. Too many consultants. Too many restrictions. Not enough team work. The culture has become Cover Your Butt.
bad,"This was a stepping stone for me to help get me into the police. You are free to work your own shifts with not much management. "
bad,The company cares for the customers.The work environment is fast paced & can feel a bit overwhelming if you do not prioritize your work load properly.
bad,"Bad for older employees."
bad,"Not an enjoyable place to work.  Legal is treated as a ""box checker"" and opinions are not appreciated or utilized by business units.  Constantly reminded that legal is a ""cost center"" and business support is needed."
bad,"While I was there the position was compensated at a level well below the industry standard. For a Part 91 operation, it has had a historically consistent turnover rate. I felt management’s only interest was self preservation. As opposed to other companies I’ve worked for, management was nothing more than a messenger. Fine group of professionals for the most part, I sincerely wish conditions have improved, otherwise it will continue to be a department that will be used as a stepping stone for most."
bad,"Poor attitudes toward change, team members prefer to do enough to get by and avoid going above and beyond, rumor mill, high school like cliques, etc."
bad,"ACE is not a horrible company, but one particular department is which is Commercial Risk Services (CRS). Lots of nepotism, management is not knowledgeable and worst of all you are micro-managed."
bad,The work was interesting but there is no advancement unless you're in the boys club. Management listens but doesn't act on anything. Salary increases are low or not at all.
bad,"If you are looking for a place that is notoriously understaffed, has a high employee turn around, keeps adding additional, unnecessary tasks to your overflowing workload, and is increasingly micromanaged: definitely work here"
bad,High expectations and lack of resources. Asked to do overtime a lot instead of them just hiring another employee to even out the work load. Average management but everyone seemed over worked. Not much room to grow and there are a lot of people at the bottom who think they will move up. Only a 3% yearly raise. Only positives are it was a nice office in O'Fallon and we had a couple catered lunches. Office was always clean and comfortable.
bad,Low compensation as compared to competitors in the industry. They work you too much. Too many meetings. They need to hire more people given the workload.
bad,"Overall, Chubb is a good place to work. It's a solid company that is embracing technology. For those that want to/like to work crazy hours, it's for you. However, the leadership takes positional authority very seriously and creates a culture in which employees work hard out of fear of the wrath of the leaders."
bad,"Good place to work as this was my first job once I graduated college.  It was an aggressive environment that did not promote temporary employees to seek for permanent employment within the company."
bad,"Claims is reporting, reporting, reporting. Results is reporting."
bad,ACE could be so much more; a true corporate leader. They have great products but they settle for so much less. Be careful of the highly nepotism based culture when it comes to more senior positions.
bad,"The company is very poorly managed in terms of work flow, its ridiculous. Work loads for examiners are impossible to keep up with unless you're working 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Management is a joke. Best Practices is their religion but they dont see the forest for the trees in terms of how debilitating and hand cuffing their Best Practices are. Supervisors tend to micro manage in order to cover their own behinds. When you get swamped and cant keep up they fire you. Vacations...HA ! You'll never recover from the massive workload that builds up in a few days. Unless you're a masochist, RUN from this company !"
bad,"I can't speak for any other office of the company but Whitehouse Station proved to be one of the worst job places in regards to nepotism and lack of real management. Having been there for 3 years and watched new, less experiences employees rise above my entry level position into titles I was prepared for, more knowledgeable in, and more researched for."
bad,Chubb was a great place to work prior to the ACE purchase.  There is no longer authority in the field.  Most of the legacy Chubb leadership has either left or retired.
bad,"New management in the Chesapeake Auto department sucks. No more flexibility. You are salary and expected to stay late until job is done, but they come down on you when you come in late or take a longer lunch. They are turning this into a call center and we are NOT call center agents. We are licensed, salaried claims professionals."
bad,"Very poor upper management and structure that only gets worse as it trickles down to the men on the ground. Good luck getting paid on time or even remotely close to due date if you are a contractor. Never in my life had such an issue being paid. Jobs can stretch out for months, expenses total up into thousands and no pay until end client signs off on job completed and even then you can wait for months to be paid. ( I' talking easily you could be waiting for $10, $20 even $25K for months. And even then you need to be  forensically inclined to track the paper / email trails. Without exception, every single job was a mess. Poorly or not organized at all. Wrong materials ordered to site. Jobs not coordinated with GC's and / or the customer. All in all a nightmare."
bad,As per annual employee survey all employees feel that management lacks direction and proper training is not provided on the job. The company need to hire people from good business schools or people who have good business judgement instead of technical people in business roles.
bad,I enjoyed this company quite a bit.  I returned using a temp agency after staying home with my children and was pleased to see many of the same faces.
bad,Great company structure ... will always be successful. Lead executives are a good ol boy network. One lies the others will agree to keep their own protected. Extreme nepotism from the highest levels. Little integrity.
bad,"Small Team environment - not allot of room to take PTO days. Favorites / teacher's Pet - does not take collaborative advise. Not true claims management according to SAM<, SSDI or case by case medical info - not allot of freedom to adjudicate claims based on employees situation who is out on leave. Sales Force Calim Vantage system not user friendly - high call volume - no training on new clients"
bad,Merger with ACE Ltd. has a change of atmosphere. Relocation mandatory. OK to work for. Salary low. Life/work balance good.
bad,"There are a lot of management issues ever since merging years ago. The structure is nonsensical and managers play favorites. If you’re not a “yes man”, you’re considered a problem and retaliated against. Ideas that conflict with management are not just rejected outright but punished. You’re simply a number and told you’re lucky to have the privilege to be there. If you’re looking for a collaborative, supportive environment, this isn’t it"
bad,"The work is steady but the communication is lacking with management. "
bad,"Since the takeover 2 years ago the moral is bad and not getting better. After the first round of layoffs, (expected some) it became all about the money/saving. The layoffs continue as the Legacy ACE model is to outsource most IT so the Chubb employees are going, by choice and as part of RIFs."
bad,The old regime was good.  Opportunities were there for the taking.  The talent and expertise is gone now.  Talent all moved on.
bad,"After the merger between ACE and Chubb, there are no longer opportunities for advancement in the company. The work environment is no longer conducive to efficiently working and moving forward with my career."
bad,A family oriented company. Coworkers are eager to assist and train.
good,"There is no work/life balance.  You are expected to do more work for the same pay. The management team micromanages everything you do. There are favorites and they hire outside of the company, and dont give current employees an opportunity to move up or to a new department"
good,"Think things through as far as staffing, procedures, and systems)They staff as if the technology worked. They do not care about the employee well-being, extremely high turnover."
good,"Poor Work/Life Balance, Micromanagement, treated like a school leaver and not like an experienced consultant used to managing their own time. Not recommended..."
good,"I always worked 12 hr shifts at night. In the early days no breaks were given at all. We had to sit at attention at all times. We were not allowed to read even when the patients we were specialling were sleeping.Senior management were always in the security office ogling nurses on their cameras, drinking coffees reading, or watching tv.It was definitely an old boy network."
good,"Chubb used to be a Great place to work, due to great people. All the employee were well respected and family life balance was encouraged. There were so many fun events organized by cultural committee, and diversity was always encouraged. we celebrated St Patrick's day, Diwali, Chinese New Year, Black History Month etc. I will really cherish my time in Chubb, we are like one big family. It was a place of passionate , respectful people."
good,No overtime but expected to work long hours year round. Finance department is overworked with no overtime pay or bonuses. good benefits based on what you select.
good,Empresa demasiado preocupada com números e pouco com a qualidade e dedicação das pessoas
good,I migrated to Chubb when Ace/Esis Proclaim merged with the company. My review is based on the one year and the prior two that I was with ESIS Proclaim.
good,Intially liked the culture and the process. Slowly lost intrest in job as there is no work collabration towards innovations or upgrades. Everything is done in secreat with a specific team .
good,Nothing is the same. The entire environment has changed and employees thought it was bad before.  Not a great place to work but thankful for the time I had previous to the acquisition.
good,"Great job except that I came in during a restructuring.  My role was changed with no training.  This was one of my most favorite roles because I got to visit clients, prospects and then underwrite very unusual risks such as 18 leased firetrucks in Iraq.  I was able to put together a CE class for agents.  I was never bored."
good,"It is a place with no manuals, no formal procedures and a backlog of work."
good,"Like being in school again. Management lab professional. Delusional environment not comfortable for people. Forced to compete, training and complete. Thrown into water with no paddle."
good,"Chubb is a very old line company that has been around forever and it shows.  The employees and even some in leadership there are openly hostile to contractors as if the contractors are going to take their jobs away which isn't surprising considering the fact that the contractors do 90% of the work while the employees and leadership sit around taking extended breaks and talking about sports, the weekend, dating, and anything else to get out of actually working.  For me my time at Chubb was an excellent opportunity to get exposure to skills that I needed to take me to the next level.  Chubb is good but others are better."
good,You are always being tested and reviewed according to how you manage your desk.  It is never relaxing.  Hardest part of the job is completing a Risk Report that I think should be done by the underwriter since they know about the risk more than a UA does.
good,A very sound company that offers superior service to it's insureds. There is a high amount of turn over in the auto department.
good,"If you are looking for a company that you can’t write any business, doesn't trust it's employees to make decisions and will not invest money into technology this is the right place. You will have multiple bosses that tell you how you are doing everything wrong and more meetings then some more meetings… No work life balance. Mgt attitude is that you drop everything to accommodate the company."
good,"Chubb was a good employer but better for permanent associates. As a temporary employee you were unable to take advantage of the benfits package, Paid time off, holiday and overtime pay, and the hourly pay was less than permanent employees."
good,"I get a call from my Supervisor advising where i will be placed for a shift usually 8 hrs sometimes 12 hrs ."
good,The acquisition by ACE happened two months after my joining Chubb.  There is understandably a lot of things up in the air at this moment.
good,"I believe Chubb overall to be a good company, with very good benefits. My personal negative experience had to do with individual conflict with one particular department VP/manager.  His management skills were none existent making for a poorly run department.  He did not properly vet the people he hired creating all kinds if of problems with his team.  I worked for Westchester prior to this individual coming on board and it was a fantastic experience and a delightful company to work for.  Put the right leadership in place and it has the potential to be one of the best."
good,"A great company to learn insurance. The work life balance is not great. This is due to unrealistic goals, which you have to work after hours at home if you hope to possible achieve them. Favoritism is shown by all levels of management. The systems are slow to the point that they hinder productivity. There is a lot of redundancy in reporting and documentation."
good,"Promised full time contract after 3 months, worked a full year and never got offered a contract once, even when I enquired there was always excuses. TL was great but upper management was awful"
good,"Working with a book of business, I learned quite a bit; however, management was not, totally, competent. The most enjoyable part was in helping others"
good,"Very focused on Metric and if you do not reach the desired goals you are left go.  Also, the management has their favorite and metrics seem to be a skewed."
good,Chubb is changing due to the recent merger with ACE. They can benefit by adding a training department which promotes consistency across all areas throughout the company.
good,"Great company to work for.  I was hired 6 months after the acquisition and it was finalized in 1st qtr 2017.  I knew going in that once the new management was established it could come down to last in could possible be first out.  However, I'm very thankful for the opportunity."
good,"Perhaps the largest and most sophisticated global insurance carrier.  Which means that you can learn a lot about the insurance industry and really expand your career in the insurance industry."
good,"Day would start @06h00 and finish about 20h00, but also learnt new products,made friends with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was getting the installations done on time as the Company used outside contractors who wre not reliable.Enjoyed the inter-action with the public."
good,Every work must produce results. Some time you will get benefit and mostly others will be benefitted. I learned to work with lots of corporates and understand their issues. I have given solutions for various situations and managed important aspects of indirect taxes
good,Management wasn't very supportive of newer employees. Older employees who had been working at Chubb for many years were respected and valued.  Newer employees were left without any support from Management.
good,"This was a family owned business, worked with 3 family members and 2 others employess. It was a good place to work untill the business closed."
good,"Chubb is a member of the South African Intruder Detection Systems Association.  Chubb South Africa offers a total security solution for domestic and commercial security requirements, provides an armed response service and is also responsible for installing, maintaining and monitoring electronic intruder alarms and surveillance systems)"
good,Busy and engaging.  Chubb is a long standing Insurance Company that provides a broad range of products to its clients.  The company continues to grow in the future by adapting to the market place.
good,"Excellent work/life balance, very flexable and great benefits.  The pay is well below average, they do not hire in a timely manner which leaves employees doing 2 somethings 3 jobs at once with no extra pay."
good,"The managment needs training.  The interpersonal skills, leadership and technical know-how are very low.  Most managers could not answer any questions about work that was performed in their department."
good,"My day would start with a call to dispatch to obtain my schedule for the day. Basically for the remainder of the day, I would go to each site and assess their needs and conduct the appropriate task to correct any issues they had encountered."
good,I worked independently from the main offiice which gives mediocre support. Local office in Independence MO is lackluster in their agent advancement programs. If you want to succeed in this industry you must be a motivated self starter that has a passion for learning outside of the office.
good,"The culture is in a state of flux post-merger. In IT especially, it is becoming especially difficult to maintain work-life balance. "
good,The care for the customer and quality of work is no longer in place at Chubb.   Over the past several years the quality of work from outsourced companies has declined.
good,"Streamline interview process, I had a phone screen followed by an in-person interview with the hiring manager and a VP covering my experience. Last interview was a phone call with the teams SVP; his energetic and laid back style focused on opportunities to use my skills and expertise to add value to the team. Ultimately to ensure fit, I could have asked more questions on company culture and work life balance."
good,"Good office work experience, however little advance in job opportunities. Difficult to move from a contracting position to a full time employee. Lack of training to new hires"
good,"Performance expectations often outweighs individual ability, and caseload rarely reflected in pay."
good,"Company offers a stable job with a reasonable work load. The management is not likely to help you succeed as most are only looking out for themselves. They typically use the employees good deeds to make themselves look good. The pay is less than industry and the benefits continue to be less and less, and post merger are the worst I've seen. While I enjoyed the job I did, they will dangle carrots and never follow through. Expect to come in do your job and leave."
good,Working at CHUBB was interesting but short.  It was just a 2 month project.  I would like to have stayed after the end of the project.  I was glad that it was a global company but it was not open to long term employment at the time I was there.
good,"This could be a great place to work, however there is no formal training in place, and you are set up to fail.  The first two years I was there you work 50-80 hours a week with no appreciation, management only cares about numbers, and not the people."
good,Coworkers are friendly and so is most of management. Good mix of  people. Work life balance is not that great. Work load can get overwhelming as people are fired or leave and are not replaced.
good,Most positions are Salary.  Be prepared to work more than 50 or 60 hours a week and only get paid for 40.  Earned time off (vacation) is always denied and they just pay you out for it.  No work / life balance.  Overwhelming work loads.
good,Overall I think Chubb is a great company. Some members of management not so much. But the company has great benefits and some great co-workers. But do not make friends.
good,"As a result of the merger of two companies, the decision was made to eliminate approximately 80 positions which unfortunately happens. However, disingenuous corporate communication led senior experienced, capable rank and file employees to believe the merger was a positive experience but in reality, it was a way to reduce expenses and payrolls. Sadly enough, the most knowledgeable and proficient employees were let go."
good,Chubb is now owned by Ace. Most Chubb employees are leaving or have been let go. Future is very uncertain as is normal in an acquisition.
good,"Its an initial step of my practical carear.It is very friendly place but if i get new opportunity then i wll grab that.This company take the project now a day this company grab ""saaf pani Project""."
good,"Upper management is widely disconnected from their bottom line. Which can be expected however it's hypocritical when they continuously preach that everyone is important but proves time and time again that they truly aren't. Constant favoritism is displayed in various departments and lack of respect is silently encouraged. Compensation has room for great improvement however upper management would rather have a high turn over rate than pay their Underwriting teams adequately. "
good,"A typical day would include Customer Service on  the phones all day along with collecting the premium from insured, agents and sometimes the underwriters would get this information to me."
good,I have worked there over a decade and just recently needed to seek other employment due to my current position being eliminated.
good,"Job is very demanding but the salary is on the very low end, compared to what the work requires management have there favorites and it is hard to become one of the ""cool kids"""
good,"Overall, Chubb Insurance is a pleasant place to work and there are opportunities for advancement."
good,Overall unhappy with managements lack of engagement in development of strong performance and lack of leadership within the organization there is a high demand on performance but limited guidance
good,"Not much to add. Many people were laid off."
good,"The work load to person ratio is completely unmanageable.  They would say well have a day dealing solely with disputes but you have in excess if 80 emails and very urgent stuff coming in,  it was chaotic and the amount of staff off with stress related illness was excessive but there was not.much support its is a kind if do what you can mentality"
good,"Great work experience, great work culture, mediocre management."
good,"The people are on the whole nice. The work environment is very slow, and the technologies they use are considered ancient in the technology world. I wouldn't choose to work there if I could find work that would motivate to be there in the morning."
good,"As with any workplace it comes down to the people and a few or couple of ""Bad Apples"" can  make the environment unpleasant. In addition to individuals who feel the need to coerce others to be part of their group."
good,"Work life balance is good depending on which group you work in. Most older employees are lifers but for younger employees there are much turnovers.  For the most part, all the supervisors seem to be nice."
good,"Chubb was a company that had long term employees who did a good job and were happy. The company was purchased by a larger insurance company and all this changed. "
good,Big company to work for only thing is you will be under paid. No debate. People you train will come in making more than you and you have to train them.
good,"I worked as a claims adjuster at Chubb Insurance for 4 months.  I was hired while it was still ACE, and started working during the merger.  I dealt with GL and auto claims, on the phone and computer all day.  Managers were good guys, but screw sitting in a chair 8-10 hours a day with a headset.."
good,ACE is a strong P & C company and its a fast pace environment with great employees in the Philadelphia PA location and globally.
good,The Chubb Group of Insurance is a great company to work for concerning benefits and retirement plans. The environment at the Insurance Company I found to be very interesting.
good,"Working environment was good, it was a friendly working culture, it was fun working as a team in site activities. General Manager was actively involving in every activities and was supportive."
good,Great place to start your career with extensive internship programs for recent college graduates. IT consistently on restructure need a new vision.
good,"I worked well with my co workers, Was in the insurance field for some time but always learned something new at one."
good,"Very long hours, time management required. Not all people easy to deal with"
good,"Generally, a day consists of 12 hours of either patrolling or working on a VCP checkpoint. It is in some ways quite similar to and relevant to Operational sentry duties and Guard Duties whilst serving in the FYR Bosnia and Northern Ireland."
good,"The company is providing good exposure to young grads giving them a first hand exposure to manage their lives on first hand,"
good,Good workmenship.i enjoyed my work.the only problem is the company is undergoing problems financially as it is cutting management posts hencce most emloyees leaving
good,My experience may differ from others but it is hard not to feel like a cog in the machine. Some people are friendly but other staff members are strict and unaccommodating when flexibility is needed.
good,"Benefits and member cost associated are great. "
good,Chubb Professional Associate training program assisted with 18-24 month training period o obtain the fundamentals of underwriting and obtaining licensing.
good,"Typical office work,  can be stressful and overwhelming at times but overall was very very laid back. "
good,This is a good place to work. Really good teams if you get in with the right leadership. Groups need to be flexible in location because most of the culture is to work remote.
good,"At first, Chubb was a very good company to work for. They were very fair and always helped their employees move up into a higher position if asked. In the end of my career at Chubb, they had a hiring ""block"" in any area that I could've interviewed out into. In my opinion that is not a good nor fair business practice. Even considering my previous statements, I would work for them again if a position became available with my qualifications, in a different department, because they offer so many benefits and special programs to be involved in.  There was always something to do and I enjoyed the variety. It was very busy and fast paced. It took someone who works very well under pressure and I feel that I excel in that area. That is also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,Chubb is a very nice and stable company to work for and i have been part of the furniture there. It is just unfortunate that i have to relocate due to personal reasons that Chubb wiil not be able to assist me with
good,It's more work then it's time and a lot of people were layed off because of the merger...which have a lot of workers feeling who is next. I think the sense of not knowing if you truly have job security effects the employees.
good,Challenging work environment and face paced. The company is structured lean and requires self starters and looks to keep streamlined to compete.  This requires a dedicated person.
good,"It's a good company with the typical workplace issues.  Advancement is contingent upon who you know and if they like you, at least from what I've seen."
good,This is a job for an individual who enjoys working and learning about insurance. Very Fast paced job; cut-throat; Overall relaxed culture; Somewhat flexible with hours.
good,"Handle worker compensation lost time make 3 point contacts. Set the appropriate reserves.  Management ok, busy work place."
good,Muy buena escuela porque te toca aprender de todo por la cantidad de trabajo.
good,"As an independent sales person, you have to be self-motivated to do this job.  In addition, use your time wisely and map out routes.  Was provided names and addresses for potential and existing customers. Lots of cold calling.  Chubb trained their people to have a positive mental attitude.  Must develop client base to be successful.  Most customers (or potential customers) are not aware that you will be visiting them."
good,I loved working at Chubb. My only reason for leaving was my current manager seemed to have a personal issue with me. Benefits are fair and compensation is good. Bonuses and raises are done fairly as well. Post merger Chubb seems to be a bit more rigid and that may be a bit of an issued.
good,"I worked for ACE which was a P&C carrier that purchased Chubb two years ago and took the Chubb name. The merger of the two companies created learning opportunities in terms of coverage lines as Chubb handled more personal lines and Middle Market business where as ACE focused more on large Deductible, Fortune 500 and 1000 Companies as customers. Due to the size of the new company, there are many job opportunities. They have a program for recent college grads which provides an excellent opportunity for growth in the industry. For those people that have been in the business for 20 years or more, the growth opportunity is less since there are fewer positions higher up the ladder."
good,A typical day at Chubb was stressful and very fast paced. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. What I learned the most is to be patient and empathic towards people.
good,"Chubb was acquired by ACE American Insurance in January, 2016. Gradually, what had been a nurturing, challenging environment with excellent benefits and a strong-work life balance changed into a much more top-heavy organization."
good,"I get that many people find Chubb very frustrating, but although the management is annoying and a bit heavy handed, there is a good camaraderie among people. The company as a whole is pretty stable, so it's a safe job I believe. However, the organisation is hopeless, with outdated complex systems, old fashioned practices and frustrating processes. However, and this is the kicker, you can turn this to your advantage as the lack of any proper organisation or direction means key projects and team roles are generally up for grabs for those who want it. Don't expect massive rewards though."
good,Depending on the department that you work in the hours could be extensive.  I worked in an area with substantial overtime especially during year-end.  I had lots of great experiences and learned alot and was able to add to my resume with the new knowledge that I gained.
good,"I was a temporary employee right out of college when I worked at Chubb."
good,"No major issues for temp contractors."
good,Culture is cut throat and all about keeping expenses low but on the other hand tons of room to move around. Typical of a large competitive company. Benefits are ok.
good,"The digital world promises consumers a better, more connected life, and we’re the ones delivering it. We make it possible for people to stay in touch and businesses to connect with their customers. We’re also bringing technology and hands-on learning opportunities directly to kids who need it most. Our goal is to inspire tomorrow’s creators to use technology to build brighter futures for themselves, their families and the world."
good,"Good atmosphere, nice staff. As Chubb & Ace merged, some differences in working hours etc. Recently introduced bonus scheme which is good and decent benefits available."
good,I feel accomplished by rating worksheets and binding coverage for the brokers.  Making sure they received their documents or endorsements for their accounts.
good,"Company culture-"
good,"Worked as a consultant in this company and it is the worst company I ever worked till now."
good,When ACE merged with Chubb it created an environment that has been unstable and unpredictable.  Management is disorganized and does not care about their employees or their morale.
good,Good place to work with people who know what they are doing.  Laid back environment.  Collegiate.  I liked that there was a lunch room with cheap prices.
good,"Not sure yet where they will land, so it's hard to give a long-term rating.  Hoping they land in a good spot, but not willing to bet the ranch on that outcome yet."
good,"It's a shame really - there were a lot of talented people who really knew their stuff.  With the Ace takeover, it's has been a slice and dice of people being let go as their systems are ""integrated""."
good,Solid Company where there is room to grow.  Seems to underpay it regards to other insurance companies.  Learned a lot about insurance here.
good,The first years working here was combination of working with great people but difficult getting work done with outdated computer systems and insufficient technology support. The company was acquired by another insurance firm which has changed things dramatically for many who had lifelong careers here.  The atmosphere now seems colder and many employees are having to look for new jobs. The former Chubb often hosted networking events for employees which fostered a better work environment.  The changes don't seem to be making things better for all employees and its probably too soon to tell how customers will react.
good,Very negative environment. no room for advancement with very poor management.
good,"Hard working role as a OSD claims Technicain."
good,Friendly and helpful associates. Pleasant and stable place to work.
good,good company to work for. excellent customer service.  takes care of their insureds.
good,"•	Processed auto, property, and GL claims. Medical billing injury claims."
good,Since it was my first job I had a good opportunity to learn. I used to enjoy the month pressure.
good,"Chubb overall was a great place to intern.  I learned a tremendous amount there an I am grateful for the opportunity.  I really wish I could say the same prospecting for a permanent position.  I'm grateful for what I've contributed but the one thing I learned about interning there is they forget about you in a heartbeat.  I didn't expect a free pass when I prospected there but I had a proven track record that I could get the job done as an intern.  Unfortunately as far as their values of embracing diversity from a different background, I don't feel they live up to that.  I've accepted the fact I wasn't meant to be a part of that company for the rest of my life.  It's their loss not mine."
good,"Since this was my first job, I learned a lot here. The process was complex and this was an opportunity for me to learn. I also got the opportunity to interact with multi-nationals. "
good,"Good place to work. Busy day, time goes fast. Great co-workers. Management ok."
good,I had been working at Chubb for nineteen years. However in 2011 my job was relocated to Kansas City. I opted not to move as my family is here in California.
good,i love to cath shoplifters
good,"Stressful. "
good,Chubb started out great but once it was bought out by ACE it turned into an entirely different culture.  What once was a place you could stay and want to retire was no more.
good,There is room for advancement if you are connected with the right individuals. Work environment is diversified. Not a lot of morale or team building. It's definitely about who you know!
good,"Prior to merger, face paced and steady flow of interesting work.  After merger - system work purely maintenance. Design and Development assignments less organized."
good,"Varied workload"
good,Processing a claims. I have learned to be more patient in this field as well as a strong teamwork. The management quite okay. The workplace culture are fun.
good,Everything has changed since the merger.  Many talented individuals have been let go to meet the bottom line.  The culture has changed and there is less value placed on the individual.
good,"The typical day is spent on the computer, emailing customers or running various reports and corresponding with others. I learned how to cooperate in an office environment. It is quite a relaxed environment but the managers expect work to be completed well and on schedule."
good,"Before Merger.... Productive, Fun, lots of advancement, team oriented, fast pace, so much Team Support and interactive between branches, etc. Social times to joke and laugh with co-workers for a spell.  People started out of High School and stayed. Great benefits, really was a great company to start and retire from with a lot of respect of employees and positive attitudes etc."
good,"While this was a great company when I started 14 years ago (one of the top 100 companies to work for), and still has many benefits, it is no longer a good fit for me. My job was essentially ""re-imagined"" into something completely different than what I have skills, training, or desire to do. It has made it impossible for me to work as an instructional designer/elearning developer, which is where my passion lies."
good,The concept of systems integration and centralized systems is non-existent...Ace is worlds behind a place like AIG who implemented SAP within the past few years. The company does well in their industry but in time the CEO's unwillingness to bring the company's technology to the 21st century will bring things crashing down. There is also no commitment by the company to have a reasonable flexibility culture.
good,"The company is in the middle of a major over hall with changes, They hire over 1000 sales people a year only to have over 90% leave after less then 3 months."
good,"Good benefits and friendly associates ,  workloads can be challenging and very high paced  based on the demands and expected timelines................"
good,"Great opportunities to change within departments however some managers need a lot of training handling a team otherwise company's benefits are great  "
good,"pre planning the month ahead, telesales , gaining commitment from the customer for time to present chubb products, ongoing fire training great work culture selling full range of chubb products."
good,"Chubb was a company that focused greatly on investing in its people. This included investing in training and developing talent, rather than hiring talent."
good,"Impressive claims handling for all insured VIP's.   One of a kind policies for higher end type homes, yachts and personal memorabilia and/or artifacts."
good,The working atmosphere is fun and mostly youthful.  The office is about what you would expect from an insurance carrier albeit a bit dated but that depends on which office you chose to work in.  Ace culture after the acquisition did not match well with former Chubb employees.
good,"Chubb was a great company to work for for the first few years. After we were bought by ACE, they have imposed a lot of needless additional work (like several required letters that are not automated and have to be drafted by hand) that has destroyed morale and diminished our ability to service our customers timely.   At the same time, they have tightened up our time requirements, which makes it more difficult to meet goal.  They are also downsizing our operations department, meaning we will be doing more of the work we were previously getting assistance with. They made our health insurance more expensive and ended our pension plan.  They decreased the amount that they contribute to 401(k)… It’s still 4% though, I think. They also have made mandatory changes to our schedule, like a requirement to be on call 24 hours a day for several weeks a year, without consulting us."
good,"Working within in the property claim department, you are never guaranteed a typical day. It is either feast or famine. You can be buried in work one day, and begging teammates for work the next. Management does their best to accommodate those with additional responsibilities, to ensure our internal and external customers are being serviced. Having mother nature be the controlling factor in your life proves most difficult, as there is no way to control when, where or how severe her next strike will be. I love the team environment, and everyone pulling together to help each other out."
good,The culture changed and employees are now numbers and not family.   The work was easy not demanding or stressful.  But the repetition can get to be a bit boring.  There was no room to grow and advance without having an inside person to direct you to the right people.  Sometimes people were not very friendly in other departments.
good,"Chubb is a great office with fabulous people to work with. I just happened to get the short end of the stick. I am expected to do quite a bit more than the other contracted employees. I even deleagte and mange work to team members under me. Yet it has been a year with no sign of when they may bring me on full time. They cannot afford to lose me from my position but do not want to compensate me as promised for the work I do. Again, this has not been the experience of most people who work there, Bosses are fabulous, employees are treated well and it is a laid back environment. If you are hired as a temp, expect to wait about a year to move to full time."
good,"I work with a great group of people.  We are always doing fun things at work and outside of work.  I have been with the company for over 34 years, and I do like my job and especially the people I work with, but unfortunately there is no room for advancement in my department."
good,"This company promotes from within, which provides for growth opportunities.  The current integration culture can be unnecessarily stressful and challenging."
good,"When your adjusting a claim related to the A&H policies, most of them are related to sickness, health and death. Sometimes you have to deny form many reasons but when you make a payment to those who need it in the most painful and critical time of their life, it feels great. It makes me feel that I am working or making something that can help them to ease that situation that they are going trough."
good,"Chubb provided a great wage while my position was available. However, after the operations closed, my contract ended. Prior experience in working throughout a closing period provided a necessary familiarity. The closing of their operations in Salem VA had nothing to do with my skills or abilities."
good,Strong leadership and staff will make the new Chubb a formidable competitor.  Lots of change and integration ahead for the next several years.
good,"Unfortunately the management in my particular department was sorely lacking.  The attrition seemed high and it was no surprise when people would be dissatisfied or leave the company.  Despite the issue with my department, the company as a whole was great and I enjoyed many of my coworkers."
good,Am computer literacy and i have diploma in logistics and supply chain management.i have also warehouse experience and selling skill and communications skills
good,"Service various equipment Service, Repair, and Maintain, Automated teller machines"
good,"Se aprende mucho."
good,Chubb had inconsistent management.  Employees often worked for different managers.  This resulted in conflicting deadlines.  Managers were of inconsistent quality resulting in inconsistent output.
good,"fast-paced, results driven, diverse cultures promoting, international position possibilities, stressful, lots of layer of managers, work/life balance has gotten better but still not great."
good,"Started out as a great company with great benefits that eroded each year.  As benefits and pay scale eroded, top talent left and was replaced with sub-par managers.  Many talented people left rather than deal with the changes."
good,I enjoyed working as part of a great team.  Team members helped each other out and collaborated on solutions for each project.  It was a pleasure being part of such a close knit team.
good,"Consistently busy under a demanding, stressful environment. Very little supervision required for position, but when it was needed, unable to obtain. Learned job responsibilities on my own initiative, yet enjoy what I do and the overall work environment."
good,Company medicare people stay to themselves for most part company doesn't offer and glitz and glamour come to work and produce they don't care about anything else. Managers aren't really friendly which makes the employee standoff is . Keep track of your work and attendance will fire you with no notice or warning
good,"Working at Chubb was a good experience. On a typical day, I would go from workstation to workstation and perform various I.T. maintenance tasks, answer phone calls related to computer system issues, and create technical help documents for employees."
good,Overall Chubb was a great place to work until it was bought over by ACE and then the workplace culture changed from mixed ages and nationalities to younger and European work force.
good,"Working for Chubb was very, very good up until 2016 when we merged with another company.  Many of their managers were kept and many of the managers that made Chubb and its employees so great were not able to stay.  The culture now is largely one based on if you were from one company or the other.  There is an increase in micro-managing that is not productive, all while asking numerous new things during a short period of time.  The services we could count on seem to be starting to erode."
good,"Organising daily workload."
good,"You will learn about insurance. You will not be paid at market levels for similar positions. Though, it's 40 hrs a week and no weekends. Not bad nor good."
good,"If I was still employed with Chubb, I'd hope that the new merger would take on the Chubb culture, and coverage for their products.  They truly were looking out for the high net worth insured."
good,"Tell us about:"
good,Excellent claims handling and superior customer service.  Very knowledgeable and tenured employees.
good,"Fast paced company that focuses on a niche market, the higher end specialty insurance market.  Focus on service and claims payments.  It has been a while since I have worked there, so not sure how much has changed. ."
good,"great company to work for, only wished it wasnt a temp job and was hired out right. Would love to work there permanently, relaxed environment, manager friendly and easy to talk to"
good,"Managed emails and clients accounts of all sizes, Made recommendations based on assessing client's needs. Most enjoyable part was exceeding goals and helping the team as a whole."
good,I enjoyed working for Chubb for 19 years. I learned a lot from all of my co workers and felt like a big family.  The environment was                        quick paced and productive.  The benefits package and paid time off was generous which allows a great work/life balance.
good,"I enjoyed working with the different executives at Ace Group. During my time there I was asked to do research for upcoming meetings, and I appreciated the opportunity to put my other talents on display."
good,The pay for this company is not very good.  After doing some research I came to find that Chubb is one of the lowest paying insurance companies.  That is really my only complaint about this company.
good,"I worked as a Package Underwriter at Chubb which involved me handling all lines of business including Property, General Liability, Worker's Compensation and Automobile. This was a goof learning experience for me as I was able to work on larger more dynamic accounts for the first time and was also able to participate in Engineering visits."
good,"i got an opportunity to work in Insurance domain. Good work culture, and processes were actually followed in this account."
good,Good company for a career minded person. The people are great and  benefits are good. Full service cafeteria serves breakfast and lunch. Free coffee as well
good,Very sociable workplace. great work/life balance. very slight window of advancement after company was purchased. learned about state regulations regarding account upkeep.
good,"Work Life balance has improved since chubb acquisition, however the amount of the work is increasing with very little increase in staff."
good,"Great place to work, efficient managers, cool co workers, and decent pay. best part would be the free parking everyday."
good,"1.	 Maintaining books of creditors and debtors & stock.Maintaining journal, bank, and cash vouchers & proper book keeping as per auditing norms"
good,Flexible fun workplace. Great management and great company for those who wish to grow in insurance industry. Great opportunities to grow and the focus is not on numbers and production.
good,"Good"
good,Most of the employees are very nice and helpful. Company just got bought out by ACE so things may change. Opportunity for advancement and to work in different departments.
good,"It's not how hard you work, it's what you get done."
good,A typical day consisted of meetings and a lot of work in groups or teams.
good,Good place to work and learn. Good people to work with. Rewards its employees
good,Was a great company to work for with good people until management decided to outsource all IT positions.
good,Typical day at work at Chubb can be very demanding. It is fast paste and the typical adjuster will be anywhere from 5-10 claims a day. Employees tend to fall behind with their diaries.
good,The work environment is productive and filled with highly- professional and acknowlegable team members. It is a pleasure to work with staff that has a history with organization that goes as far as 40 years.
good,"After merger, company culture and environment has been changed.   There are still every good folks working there, however the environment is definitely changed and pressure from top to down is seen at all levels."
good,The most enjoyable part is working with co-workers and get the job done on time.  Chub has a great culture.Staff members must be convinced of the benefits that continuous learning can bring both to the team and to the company’s goals as a whole.
good,it is a good company to work for - require dedication and commitment - but pay accordingly.  I was happy with my time there and felt compensated appropriately .  Being part of a down-sizing is never fun or easy but hold no ill will towards the company - an interesting place to work
good,"I really would have liked to stay at this company was there for a year when my dad had a heart attack. That was the only down fall with the company I put my all into my work and the entire year I was there I had 0 data entry mistakes. And they did not seem to care that I had to take time off for family, they do not offer days off with out pay. In order to take time off you have to use your PTO. Which meant I had to use all mine to take care of my dad."
good,"Over my years at Chubb, I have witnessed both good and bad work environments. For the claims department, I feel there can be no sense of accomplishment due to the culture. No one ever applauds someone for doing something right, only when they do something wrong."
good,"Due to the merge of Chubb and Ace, it is essentially a new company. The pre-merger Chubb wasd backwards in terms of technology and did not reinvest in technology and replacing aging systems. The post-merger entity is prrobably different."
good,Job was downsized.  Good Company to work for.  Worked with and for great people internally and externally.  We worked as a team and were cross trained in several units which allowed the workload to be manged well.
good,The best part when I earned my commission. ..the hardest part when I cant get any sale on that day...team leader very supportive and friendly . flexible  hour.
good,"The company is great to work for, unfortunately they are relocating NYC workers comp department to Basking Ridge, Manager's Changed. Professional Environment & Great place to be at"
good,"hubb was my first experience in The Insurance IT industry , I started there right out of college and was young , I learned many things about Commercial Insurance, Workers Comp, General Liability, Property and Automobile Insurance and all the different coverages and discounts available, and how the premiums are generated and the different components , formulas used to rate the different insurance lines. The hardest part of the job was making sure your projects were completed on time , the most enjoyable part was the extra curricular activities Chubb did for its employees, The Picnic, Christmas Party, Halloween party"
good,I am a HR Administrative Assistant for 2 SVP's and love the work I do. Everyday is different and everyone is HR is like family. Chubb overall is a great company to work for they are flexible and take care of their employees.
good,Co workers were great. Management was fair. Learned how to use LDRPS.  Overall it was a great place to work.
good,i learned to handle difficult situations while working and  my co-workers were supporting me in my workplace
good,productive and fun work place. Not to much over time. Mostly 8 hours of work.Very friendly co-workers.
good,Great products and very high caliber agency plant. Market focus is narrowly defined to garner profitability. Management was generally quite good though not always receptive to experience or learnings from outside its own culture.
good,"Got to know a lot of great fellow employees and management. Great benefits, hard work and a lot of it. I left co. for a better financially situated opportunity. In the long run, it did not work out for my benefit."
good,"I am thankful to start my career at a company like Chubb. They have given me the tools and attention necessary to succeed at my current job. The best part of my job is the people I work with everyday, they make the headaches of the insurance industry worthwhile. With this being said, I am searching for a more progressive, fast-paced industry."
good,"The try hard to maintain their company mission of good quality service to their insureds. They expect high productivity, but maintain a culture of understanding towards their employees."
good,good job just not the right time in my life but a decent place to gain experience and to start working towards a potentially great career. Would recommend to anyone looking into insurance field.
good,Chubb has its pro and cons like any company but overall it was a good place to work.  Salaries and low for industry but depending on who you work for the bonuses can make up for it.
good,"Worked on 2 different systems, ran various reports, produced letters, assisted adjusters and whatever else needs to be completed.  Repetitive work, easy to learn however not challenging."
good,"En ACE se trabaja en un buen clima laboral, donde se privilegia la vida personal. Los horarios de trabajo permiten el desarrollo de actividades personales."
good,"Checking mailboxes for new complaints, adding these complaints and allocating these to the relevant case handler, request files with regards to complaints involving the Financial Ombudsman. Adding this information to Spreadsheet for the case handlers to make them aware of cases assigned to them. Logging the complaints on to the complaints system. Once checking that these are eligible. Maintain the GDPR process throughout workflow. Retrieving any policies and documents requested by the case handlers. Communicating with other resources to ensure have all relevant information to process complaints within the designated timeframe."
good,"I worked there many years ago and at that time there was a lot of transition within the loss control department. I had three managers, one of whom died. The culture within the loss control department was collaborative however the company's culture overall was not very inclusive towards minorities. Chubb is well known and trains employees very well. The company offers many benefits."
good,Very underpaying job for the amount of work that is required. The pay relative to Chubb's competitors pale in comparison. With recent merger of Ace and Chubb perhaps that will change going forward.
good,"Usually started at 5-530am and ended around 6pm  Mon-Friday "
good,Working there gave me many opportunities to do interesting and diverse projects.  It was a lovely work environment with many young and intelligent people.
good,"Typical day at work was hectic to say the least. The hardest part about the job was not being familiar with the line of business; but I was lucky to work with a great team that helped me learn the ropes very quickly.  Thanks to such group of professionals, I'm a better version of me today!"
good,"Chubb is one of the largest insurers in the United States. Chubb offers commercial, specialty and personal insurance services."
good,"Great benefits, very diverse culture. Co-workers were great to work with. Gained a lot of knowledge and experience in the insurance industry.  Department was flexible with work/life balance."
good,"This company is a great company to work for. However,...room for growth is highly manager dependent and there tends to be ""pigeon-holing"" if your manager does not desire you to move on in the company. Moreover, one is not allowed to seek an internal position without informing his/her manager first. Essentially, an employee is then stuck working for the same individual in the same department. Work/life balance is better than at most companies but I rated it mediocre as it could be better. For example, given the type of work that I do does not involve much human interaction (almost none), there is very little reason why I have to beg to work remotely when one of my kids gets sick or I have commuting/logistical issues (like the cable guy coming to fix something or a doctor appointment near where I live which would cause me to have to leave earlier from the office than I would have to if I worked from home) or that if I leave the office at 4 45 instead of 5 00 PM (most days I am at the office until 6 00 PM or beyond), I am bound to have a voice mail from my boss with a shock that I am not in the office. The projects are fascinating. I am never bored. For the amount of work that I do relative to some of my peers in financial engineering, the compensation is excellent."
good,Typical day consisted of the everyday finance and accounting duties. All the coworkers are extremely nice and very enjoyable to be around.
good,"I loved the niche I worked in and got a lot of support from that team all the way up to home office. However, working with local management was a struggle and there were times I felt treated unfairly as a woman. Previous bosses were females and extremely supportive, but my last boss was a male and acted unprofessionally at times."
good,"I only had an internship experience, I liked the insurance industry also the culture of the company I think the compensation they offered was not high enough to make me to stay with them."
good,"As an account service manager there are more pros than cons. Very Flexible workplace, great staff, and fun outings."
good,"Good Management"
good,Very knowledgeable people in a fast but relaxed environment.  Opportunity to learn more.  Comlplex data but crucial for accuracy. Supervisor(s) always there to guide and train you.  Business moved business to Pennsylvania and overseas.
good,The environment at Chubb is relaxed.  You will learn a lot.  There is a work/life balance.  The pay is on par with the market for insurance claims salaries.
good,"As the largest property and casualty insurer in the world Chubb's growth over the past few years has been unprecedented. Overall, Chubb is an excellent place to work, with an attractive compensation and benefits package. They value their employees, foster an environment of inclusiveness and encourage development."
good,Most of my career in the insurance industry was with Chubb. Unfortunately I was part of the downsizing when purchased by Ace Group. I would have loved to retire from this company.
good,Start work at 8:30. Receive work plan and start prioritizing my day according to that. Learn new things everyday. Given training. Workplace culture is good. Get paid overtime.
good,"I was the international liaison between USA underwriters and our foreign offices when a customer needed an insurance policy anywhere outside of the USA.  I negotiated with our foreign offices for the customer, from start to finish, when the policy was issued. I was very self-sufficient, a great problem solver and had an excellent rapport with my superiors.  I worked with awesome colleagues around the world.  I was entrusted to work from home the last several years of my employment, and, my productivity was even greater, not having the interruptions and noise of the office.  I won awards for ""Best Service in the World"" twice after I began working from home.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my colleagues and customers."
good,"Working very happy with my colleague, we will talk about what we did and what are we doing today make a plan and do the best job."
good,Chubb was a good experience. The team I worked with was open and hard working. The hardest part of the job was not taking it home with me daily. The most enjoyable oddly enough was I wanted to take it home.I learned to assist others and complete individual work.
good,"After putting in a 10 hour day, my manager suggested that I take the time to pull out my laptop and do additional work wile watching TV at home. Everything was rush, rush, rush with no time to develop any professional relationships with other groups and team members."
good,I managed complex Performance and Payment Bond claim files.  I learned to work in a large corporate environment that included many layers of corporate management for reporting purposes.  My colleagues provided a great work atmosphere which made it enjoyable to work there.  The was not any part of the job I was able to perform and I looked forward to the challenge.  My colleagues were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Productive high volume and high pace environment.  Ever changing laws, rules and regulations and workflows. Must be proficient in several skill areas. Keeping up with trends."
good,Responsible for getting policies issued overseas. Responsible for $12 mil book of business.  Very high stress

Then Ace bought out Chubb Insurance in 2016.

good,"Scheduling meeting (US & International)  for SVPs of Global IT"
good,"Chubb was bought by ACE Insurance in late 2016. As a long time contractor I new the old Chubb culture very well and knew nothing about ACE. What I've learned is, they are a fast moving company. They take new ideas and try them immediately without a lot of planning or discovery and process detail. On one hand this keeps them current on industry trends. On the other hand, it's chaotic and leaves a lot of people frustrated because they aren't given clear outlines for their job, and processes are made up on-the-fly. Sometimes that leads to confusion and frustration, other times it helps get things done because there's not a lot of ""red tape"". Chubb is really ""ACE in Chubb clothing"" at this point, even though a lot of legacy systems and people are still being used. But that's changing as I speak. The purging of mostly legacy Chubb people began back in December of 2016 and is now going strong. ACE is basically taking the opportunity of the purchase of Chubb as a time to give expensive employees the boot and replace them with younger, cheaper versions. Though there are some older ACE workers who will be keeping their jobs, some are being cut. Most hard hit are the old Chubb employees with many years in the company and are at the top of their pay scale."

good,"Het inplannen van afspraken en bijhouden van de agenda's van 9 ingenieurs in het binnen en buitenland was de belangrijkste taak van al mijn werkzaamheden, dat nam het meest van mijn tijd en aandacht in beslag. In deze functie heb ik dan ook geleerd om meer los te laten, daarmee bedoel ik dat ik heb moeten leren meer geduld op te brengen. Een afspraak maken in deze functie was niet zomaar gebeurd, ik had met diverse partijen te maken, de ingenieur, de klant, de tussenpersoon en mijn collega's in het buitenland, waaronder Duitsland, Denemarken, the US, GB, Schotland,Ierland, Australie en Frankrijk. Want voor 1 afspraak kon ik de ingenieurs niet naar het buitenland sturen, dat moesten er op zijn minst twee tot drie zijn. Het gebeurde dan ook regelmatig dat de planning overhoop geschopt werd, vaker dan me lief was en dan kon je weer overnieuw beginnen. Maar dat maakte de functie ook erg uitdagend en interessant. Daarnaast kreeg ik veel hulp van mijn collega's in Nederland, ik kon altijd bij ze aankloppen en ze hielpen me zo snel mogelijk, dat was heel prettig. Bij mijn collega's in Duitsland waar ik veel me te maken had, lag dat wel eens anders omdat hun prioriteiten anders lagen en dat maakte het wel eens moeilijk voor mij om mijn taak goed uit te voeren. Maar ik zorgde dan wel voor andere manieren om de problemen op te lossen. Ik ga net zo lang door tot ik de juiste persoon heb gevonden om mij verder te helpen. Het leukste van mijn baan was dat het een internationale organisatie was, ik had contacten over de hele wereld en ik moest ook wel eens naar het buitenland voor trainingen"

good,10 years plus working for ACE Group. Supporting the underwriting department. Adapting to a younger culture. Good company.

Good benefits compensation isn't stellar, but they try to maintain profitability so there's job security and the tradeoff is that it's a very respectable and ethical company with a long history.  Could do a lot worse than working for Chubb, that's for sure. Probably the nicest offices in the business on the company side.

Although sometimes that means they throw their weight around to get something that they want done, so there is that type of pressure.  "
