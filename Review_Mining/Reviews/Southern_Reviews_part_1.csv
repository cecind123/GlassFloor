bad,"My position is file clerk and I work part time 20 hours per week.  I have learned how to file documents for the WIC warehouse in a orderly and timely basis.  Management is the very best.  Treats everyone fairly.

good,I was a Southern Belle for Southern Proper. I was the Appalachian State rep and was incharge of marketing Southern Proper's products. I really enjoyed this internship
good,"My experience started out being very fun and easy going.  I was learning a lot (and I still am) but new management stepped in and they took the fun right out of it.  People are always in fear of what the boss will do next.  I have been given a lot of responsiblity which I appreciate, but often times  I get over loaded.  All in all, it has been stable, but I do not see any advancement in my future and I do not trust the management at all."

good,"Overall SBAI is a good place to work.  The company is small which fosters a “Family” environment.    While this setting can be advantageous, it also comes with assuming responsibilities which take away from applying quality technical solutions.  My background is primarily with Mainframe systems, however I have been able to apply my general knowledge go coding and now a highly competent PLB programmer.    I have a very positive relationship with my management and given that I am the sole developer supporting the Pension/Retirement/Annuity development and maintenance I have gained their confidence to meet their business needs.   While being the sole developer of an area comes with pride and ownership, on the flip side this position requires that I provide solutions that solve the immediate problem rather than develop a repeatable process that would allow for more efficient and cost effective future modifications for the company.  This concept conflicts with my development standards to deliver high quality reusable code."
