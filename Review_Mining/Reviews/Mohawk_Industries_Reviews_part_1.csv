bad,I learned how to use ups/ fed-ex systems worked at a fast pace.however it was very little team work and effect. Every person was pretty much on there own within two days Fortunately I was able to learn at a fast pace however there was some that didn’t
bad,"Management is HORRIBLE!!!, & the pay is a joke. Mohawk does not care about the employees. If you are not in the clique, you will get cheated over & over. Forget about going to management about any concerns; they will tell you where the door is. I would not recommend Mohawk to ANYONE...not even my worst enemy."
bad,This place was nothing more than a garbage heap that doesnt know how to treat their employees i takes an act of congress to get any time to take a leak in the john.
bad,Place sucks will have you work 16 plus hours a day 7 days a week and is over run with it’s who you know not what you know mentality and Constance OSHA violations
bad,"Management is in full blown violation of FMCSA on so many levels. They have you get up durring your sleeper berth time to do a backhaul and if you complain they starve you. Supervisor has no clue of and D.O.T. or FMCSA rules and regilations, heck he can barley speak english.. overall direct manager is not an honest broker.  "
bad,"Working for Mohawk was alright. The pay could have been better, but it wasn't terrible. We were often short handed. Would work alot of hours during the busy season and then fall off during the slow season."
bad,"The amount of stress that comes this this job is pathetic. It gets BEYOND hot in the summer, you don’t get decent breaks, you don’t get sick days & I could go on and on. DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
bad,"The best thing Mohawk has going for it is their talent, but the company takes advantage of their top performers by expecting them to work overtime, canceling vacations, requiring you work on vacation, terrible health benefits, no career advancement unless it's politically opportunistic for executive leadership, lack of diversity. Executives get their bonuses by cutting staff and slashing merit increases."
bad,Mohawk is a company that is as selfish as it gets - with cliques and boosting friends to higher roles rather than the employees that have worked hard and deserve them. I would NEVER recommend working for this company.
bad,"Job posting is misleading, what they offer is not what you get. They pay you by the piece count also by the mile and for each stop. So when your stops are 20 to 30 miles apart it makes for a long day and never mind if the customer refuses the order you lose.  The route person can make or break you so do some brown nosing. But don’t take my word try it out and you will see."
bad,"Americans."
bad,No respect management will talk to you like you’re nothing at all. Then it’s no climate control so that’s a bother. This job used to be good but with my four years there it went downhill fast. Too many shutdowns forcing you to use vacation hours.
bad,Mohawk made some very bad business decisions and as a result at age 61 after 18 years of dedicated work for the company I was released due to no failure on my part preforming my required job duties along with 40 other individuals.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to no,one ..especially if you dont like split shifts..and just wanna get your day over with this is not the job for you...u go in from 10:30 -2 & 5:30 till 9...but Friday & Saturday  10 :30 - 2:00 & 5 -10 they ask you to do to much work for that lil pay..if someone call in they expect you to do they job n yours tooo..Wasnt satisfied at all!! U off on Sunday & mondays"
bad,"This company in no way offers a healthy work/life balance. You will be devoting 70% of your waking free time to work; getting ready, commuting, working a 12 hour shift with a 30 min lunch and 10 min breaks (if you're lucky) 5-6 days/week. In my opinion this is asking too much and the reason why Americans feel overworked. The number one mission statement at this company that governs the other mission statements is ""to create value for the shareholders""; in other words, keep the shareholders rich. By overworking their employees they are fostering an environment to keep everyone exhausted, uninformed, unhealthy, and unhappy."
bad,Not the best job for the family tend to be working all the time even if listed as part-time your still working 6 days because they want your weekends.
bad,I enjoyed my job and when someone was out on a machine that had an order on it that had to be out by certain time frame. they would put me on that machine to finish the order  ran more beams than anyone on all three shifts
bad,"This position was horrible, stank, no managerial over site, no assistance, obvious bias in hiring and promotion. The main manager will fire you and tell everyone you quit."
bad,"Mohawk industries is an awful place to work. The management is unorganized as well as the supervisors and team leads. None of the employees care about the quality of the product being made. Most employees at Mohawk take it as a joke. Even if you stick to yourself in that work environment your almost always involved in some type of drama everytime. This job is stressful and takes most of your energy, felt more like a preschool rather than a factory. I would not recommemed this place of employment to anyone."
bad,"Horrible managment team at Hillsville, Virginia plant. Human resources will not help employees. If you're not friends with management or kin to them good luck."
bad,If management was better it would be an amazing job. But until they fix that this job will not be a good work place. U can't pick just anybody to run ur plant.
bad,The working environment was unsatisfactory on so many levels from safety to production and other varies inconveniences that cause the company to not do so well and lay off several coworkers and friends.
bad,This place will hire Hispanic people but if your white or black don't expect to be here longer than 90 days. Last time I worked here I had to go through a staffing agency that paid $8.00 an hour and I had to go 30 miles to the next county to get a job that was 5 miles from my house. Mohawk does not care about the community they are in and they do not care about the people in the community. Mohawk cares about bringing Hispanic people in from the next county over.
bad,"supervisors use foul language, disrespect workers, are unprofessional. turn a blind eye to serious issues. do everything they can to cover their behinds, but have no real geniune concern for workers."
bad,Very oraganized great  company to work for. The production was very high very demanding and we met our requirements each time.  I loved the breaks and I loved the management.
bad,This job was a lot of work for one person. They do not have a training system intact. You are just thrown on the job and no one bothers to tell the how to do it. They except way too much from one person while others walk around and do nothing.
bad,"Good place to work.Competitive wages,fast paced productive environment.a,learn something new everyday kind of place to work."
bad,"they tell you they hire within, but when applying for a job you have qualifications for, they hire outside the company. they cannot keep help, always under-staffed. No overtime allowed. Micro managed, upper management always complaining. typical day answering over 100 phone calls a day. customers want to know about their orders we are advised to give them scripted answers even though we know what is going on (delivery info, production, etc). company doesn't care about you or their customers only how many orders you can take & how much money they make."
bad,"I was not a fan of the way this company did business. I did however enjoy the pay, at the time it was the most I'd ever made."
bad,Busy with mostly friendly people. We made dye and assured it was the proper color for printing.
bad,"Highly stressful supervisors are very demanding of production. This company is not family oriented not allowing you weekends off. Basic health, vision and dental with high deductible."
bad,"Roanoke Al "
bad,"Good pay and benefits. However, if you are not related to or are buddies with the management, you will not advance. No matter how hard you work or how good your attendance, you will be no more than a number in this company."
bad,"Poorly managed plant. Supervisors and Leads have severe lack of experience in their positions. Never know what hours your working from day to day. Schedule changes last 10 mins of each shift from day to day. The safety program is a double edge knife, lots of injuries but it's always the employees fault! Most senior person there has 3 years. EXTREMELY High turnaround"
bad,Absolutely horrible place to work.  I worked there for 5 years and had multiple jobs there and each was as worse as the last. You are not appreciated at all and if you were a hard worker you were walked all over as the lazy non reliable workers were overlooked. Management is horrible. No one knows what is going on. You always had eyes on you as if you were doing something wrong.
bad,"The reason I do not recommend it is because this place had the opportunity to be a strong employer in this community with a severe lack of jobs and they let us all down ,they could have been more fair to the people"
bad,Terrible management.  No respect for employees.  They talk safety first but do not practice it.  Management makes you dread going to work everyday.  Not an enjoyable place to work at all
bad,It's very hot no fans around and some fans don't work and you got to hurry up and to go to other Machines and if you are not fast to creel the Supervisor will tell you that you been here for awhile and looks mad and the splicers are not good.
bad,"Typical day for night loaders consists of showing up on time and then cleaning or sitting around for an hour and half until the team supervising you finally gets the order lists. Once you have orders time flies a little faster, then for whatever reason, the supervising team slows everything down and doesn't delegate as many orders so they can pull some overtime."
bad,worrked  odd  hrs    management  was  never  happy  with  any  thing  u  do set  imposible goal    and  aways  short  handed    and  they  still  expect  u  to  keep  up  prduction
bad,company is very selfish. only think about themselves. they dont crae if you hurt yourself or not. they only care about production. management is very very poor. they wont get you the help you need. all machine operators just stand around and watch the lines. they dont help at all
bad,Some of the People there are rude and hateful. Pay was ok. Most of the time we worked the machines were broke down and they made up sweep and there was nothing to do and nothing to sweep. It was a very boring job. They also dont train people very well they just throw you on a job and expect you to know how to do it..I would not want to work here again.  O and you only get one 20 minute break and one 30 minute break for lunch on an 8 hr shift and if you work 10 hr shift they only give u two 10 minute break and one 30 minute break for lunch which I didnt like. Most places at least give you two or three 15 minute breaks.
bad,"Half of the jobs could and SHOULD be automated..."
bad,This place sucks favoritism is terrible.   Managers lie to you're face and behind your back and cant go to hr about nothing cause she makes you feel like you cant talk to her and that your beneath her unless you're. one of her buddies.  Just an overall dump to work at and the worst communication ever.
bad,"Management doesn’t care about you. You’re just replaceable. No chance to move up in the company unless you’re close to management. Rude, and not willing to work with you according to your own life."
bad,They hire anyone and most hires are out of prison and they have that prison mentality. No communication at all with this company. No supervision what so ever on floor. The supervisor or lead men have no training in this position at all. Don’t even see how they are still in business.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work until around 6 years ago, then the company mission became all about the stock market price instead of customer satisfaction. Upper management manages through fear. Long-term employees are cast away like disposable diapers. Management in North Georgia act like they care about the people, but it’s only a dog and pony show! Benefits and pay are sub-par. Regional and local warehouse managers work long hours cleaning up mill operation mix ups, messes, and issues. Mill management can’t manage their operations, so local delivery warehouses have to clean up after them. Customer product is often damaged when transferred to final mile delivery location. Back orders and production delays are a major issue. Right now, I wouldn’t recommend anyone for a job at Mohawk."
bad,"Very poor management, no training at all, just was expected to do a job with no training. I do not recommend this place of employment at all. Very miserable place to be, favortism is a huge problem."
bad,Terrible place to work.  We r just a number. They don’t care about their employees.  Just how much money we can make them.  At least in the tufting department.  Make u run 2 machines with no extra pay.
bad,You don’t know from day to day if you have a job or how many hours you’re working. It’s super stressful and you don’t get paid enough for the work you do.
bad,"Management is absolutely awful.  From the leads to the boss.  This is a company that wants to have you in a choke hold with either absences or write ups.   This company added extra days to my absences to fire me right before Christmas time when business got slow.  I have seen this company send spilt pallets to customers with the leads knowing about it.  Management had us breaking stacking height rules that were clearly labeled on the pallets then blamed us when things started to fall.  Then threatened to write us up.  I could go on and on but basically..."
bad,"This company has the worst poor management ever. I worked in alot of warehouses with over 10 years of experience and this Mohawk warehouse in Fontana is the WORST company I ever worked in. I left my job of one year to come work for Mohawk because of the $2/hr more but I was let go in less than two months. The night shift is a nightmare to be in! Management there  is horrible and irrelevant. They want you to learn 10 years of experience in 1 month. The veteran employees there are two face liars, backstabbing and will rat on you on everything you do. Management will treat you horrible and is always on their side. After they fired me management even lied to EDD by saying I quit the company so I wouldn't receive my unemployment. The pay is not worth it for the work and the ugly drama you will experience."
bad,18 new employees were hired with me at the same time. After 60 days ONLY 16/18 were still employed at Mohawk. Everyone of them were fired!!!! Person in which I will not mention told us when we first came in on this shift that if ANY of us were still there after 90 days it would be a miracle!!!!! HE WAS RIGHT!!! DO NOT WORK FOR MOHAWK INDUSTRIAL PARK LOCATION!!!!!!!
bad,I had a hardworking staff that gave 100% everyday. Their only concern was having to work with faulty equipment. The request to repair lifts were slow in coming or sometime completly ignored. Lets just say upper managment have alot to be desired when it comes to their managment skills.
bad,"I do not know how this company runs from a manufacturing point of view but from a sales and marketing perspective particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, there are no values and almost zero customer loyalty. MOHAWK will sell their product to anyone that has a bank account and a check book. All the products cross over into other lines. Even the higher end products (Karastan, Wunda Weve, Custome Weave) that they try to tell retailers are top quality and top of the line, crossover into some BS Home Depot product with a different name at a much lower price. Then they tell you to go out and lie to you customers and tell them that it is a different product. If you are a person that has a soul and simply cannot sell you soul to THE COMPANY for a pay-check, this is NOT the company for you. Beware!!! From a sales and marketing perspective, this Company is nothing but lies lies lies."
bad,"This company does pay my bills so I can give it to them for that. Upper management is a joke..from department head to plant manager. They say they believe in safety but they assign us an unachievable workload. They make decisions about employees doing their job that they think is best...it's easy to tell someone to do something when you're not having to do it yourself. Roanoke mills is the worst place to work for, management wise, that I've come across. They need to better their people skills and common sense."
bad,"I enjoyed the early years with the company. It was fast paced, we worked hard and grew the business. My position was eliminated, because of economic's.I hope the company and people do well as alot of good people put blood, sweat, and tears into the business. I learned a lifetime of knowledge about all aspects of warehousing,transportation and distribution."
bad,They will fire you for anything. They dont have people to train you for the job they put you on. It's not a secure job. The hours are crazy one minute your working 12 to 15 hour days then a week later you are getting laid off
bad,"Harrassed and bullied for 3 years. Set up to fail. Told to xo things then get wrote up for it. Told plamt manager of problems with harrassment and he just igmored them. Also, i supposedly bypassed a safety switch but everything is so jumpered out, i truly cannot say it worked in the first place."
bad,"I drove a squeez hyster fork , sample department, warehouse, loaded and unloaded trucks, worked 11 to 12 hours a day. Sometimes invatory on Saturday! I started painting again, and left with a notice"
bad,"The department i was apart of was very unprofessional. The department was small. The manager was very childish, and would insult employees. (Claimed she was joking) My co-workers were great."
bad,they have a healthy life center that you can go to instead of going to a doctor.
bad,"The work environment was not good but everyone can have a different experience."
bad,"Management treated us like garbage, points were abused, and holiday pay was used without our agreement. Mohawk paid great money but it was the worst job I've ever walked into .. and when I walked away, I left with depression, anxiety, anger issues and trauma. My supervisor wouldn't allow us to have breaks, use the restroom or let us use vacation time unless it was in a timely manner for him."
bad,"It was ok to start with...long hours, hot a lot of days, was a good place to work for a long time ago. Management changed and the job got stressful. Lazy workers."
bad,The company is political and hard to create a network because the culture is non cohesive and untrusting. Communication is very fragmented and the culture is very unprofessional.
bad,"I wouldn't work there again. Didn't like my boss. He tried framing me on the other shift work and I stopped him in his tracks. Tried to write me up over standing my ground,. Their training sucks. When you are not billignal and they say figure out yourself and you have never done the job before. Well that explains it all"
bad,It is ok to work at if you don't mind spending more time there than doing anything else.the people are good that you work with and the work itself is easy
bad,"Manager has bad morals, he plays by "" its my way or your the enemy"" Co-workers are good. You cannot have an outside life working hours are ridiculous."
bad,Overall Mohawk was a good employer. It was a nightmare to deal with management and supervisors. One of the jobs I had was tufting utility. Now they recycle everything. If one the creels tossed there yarn scrap in the trash management would get on to me. And would not hear other wise.
bad,I was able to have a flexible schedule upon starting at Mohawk Industries. I was able to work remotely and conduct meetings outside of the office. I would have liked more autonomy to make my own decisions and grow as a professional.
bad,"Make your overtime in the beginning if the year. November and december no more than 40 hours a week. Good ol boy system, all they care about is budget and keeping the upper management wealthy and keeping the blue collar class check to check. Would rather dig ditches than work for this company again. Pooroverawork cultire"
bad,Horrible place to work I would never recommend anybody to go therePoor management all the way around the board warehouse drivers logistics very unsafe place to work with that being said I think OSHA needs to come out to Sunnyvale Texas Marazzi tile  dispatch is horrible out of six dispatch employees only one does a great job won’t say her name  you can quickly be pulled in by the money but it’s so not worth it  they definitely will not own up to anything that they do wrong you will take the fall by yourself .
bad,"4pm -2nd shift starts the day' pre trip routine with a slip seating tractor ,continually trying to get repairs made to equipment before shop closes at 5pm ,  dealing with management / dispatch  pushing for quick response on the first load even before repairs are completed . - constantly dealing with poor work ethics.  pickup /del to local warehouses.                                                                                 The best part of the day-going home..."
bad,Mohawk does not care about employees.  Mohawk only cares about money. They like to kick you when your down. Mohawk is a racist company . Specile treatment of your not white
bad,"Worked for this employer 14 years, Was permanently laid off in June."
bad,There is no overtime opportunity what so ever and 1 week of time off for the first 3 years and the cost of living raises are a joke no opportunity to make any kind of extra pay
bad,Worked there for almost 3 years they care nothing about u u r a number to them and that is all over worked pay is great if u want to sell ur soul for a check
bad,"Wish that I could say Mohawk was a good place to work but it is not. The plant in Glasgow, VA has no authority back in the part were I work. Working atmosphere is negative and the lady operators have too much on them for the $12.48 an hour we make. We are doing 3 peoples job. I consider myself a good worker but others do not care just there to make paycheck."
bad,I was laid off for lack of work. They could have prepared the employees ahead of time fort he change and the did not. It was not a good transition. Many people were forced into retirement.
bad,"I worked at Mohawk for many years, I am unsure of telling a friend or anyone else to apply to this company because of the stress."
bad,"You could take a job here if you really, want and they hire you on to there team, you probably are better off elsewhere ,hopefully they will treat a family man better than a single one trying to make a life for himself !"
bad,"Upon applying to this company I was very excited. I even mentioned it to some local graduates. When I called to follow up, I was severely mistreated by the person who answered the phone (this was at 6:27p.m.), who was unaware that I had graduates being taught Life Experiences in the workforce. I have bragged about this company and then was mortified by the lack of common respect and communication afforded to me and the other young adults who listened to this ""professional"" speak so disrespectfully. I will not put them before the class again. What an absolute disappointment. When asked regarding anything, the short curt response was constantly a ""No."" When asked if I could leave a voicemail, it was a short ""No."" Without any reason whatsoever. This company has lost my support for the foreseeable future."
bad,"It is a ok place to work ,it pays bills that's about it ,w lot of bs come with it and made up rules ,no respect for the employees are appreciation an so"
bad,"Number of things including no safety. No moving up to higher positions. Handling a job task way above pay grade. "
bad,I was employed for Mohawk for 17 years the pay was and mostly  fair for all .do not get a injury or you no longer have a job trust me I got injured had a surgery on my back I didn't file workers comp claim because of discouragement from management and hr my wife and son work there as well after surgery I return to work im fired for something that every one does even management then my wife of 23 years divorces  me and marries a coworker at Mohawk a few months later she gets a 4 dollor an hour raise which is unheard of at Mohawk working for this company coast me my health my home my family  my life all I had worked for is gone i have no job no family no money and a broke back all because of there greed work there if you want but you mean nothing to them I thought I did after that long of a time but once injured all they care about is this that you say I didn't get hurt here  I ve applied for disability and have been denied twice im appalling the decision good luck to my ex her new man and Mohawk keep your funds if it means that much to you the lord will make away   this that I speak to all is absolutely  the truth ps if indeed removes this they care not foe you either that's indeed for letting me post   regards in need of attorney
bad,"Management in the call center is comprised of non college graduates. They have worked their way up from mill jobs and are not equipped to manage groups. They lack the expertise of vision and ability to put together cohesive policy and promote individual growth."
bad,"mandatory overtime even on holidays, heat with no a/c, cold weather with no heat"
bad,Keep the machines running so I want create a whole of waste. How to troubleshoot each position so it wouldn't create waste. We got a long very well. We got a long some days was better than others. Keeping the positions running for twelve hours. Helping other associates keep there position running while my line was still running and seeing which shift can run the lease waste.
bad,"At Mohawk, a person is just a cog in a machine. You can and will be easily replaced. Be that you resigned, were terminated or died on the job- rest assured that there is a replacement for you already on the pipeline. Extremely limited chance of advancement."
bad,everyone is expendabel. not good management. long hours. no good pay. the upper does not care for the lower. points for everything including dr with a note.
bad,"Worked there  for over a decade  till management finally harassed me to quit. Was a good employee, great attendance and work well above average production. Never even had a write-up.  It’s a job to pay bills but it’s dead end with no advancement and if you have problems with management or anyone really don’t count on it getting resolved because they are all buddy buddy. Their idea of saving money is to cut out lower paid employees and double the work load on rest but yet have many management personal standing around doing nothing but socializing all day. And yet we get  bullied  and harassed if jobs are not done. Also they create jobs out of thin air (yet they trying to save money) for their buddies. So Just watch your back if you go to work there and keep a back plan."
bad,"I have a great group of friends, that will help you out when"
bad,"there was to much favortism, i enjoyed working for this company all he years i was there"
bad,"Advancement is week at mohawk, but the company provided insurance, paid vactions, 401k, dental, and more. The lay-off I recieved is not fair because the company`s department head promised to re-call me after 6mo. The recall never happened after 17 years of labor. I honestly wouldn`t recommend starting a family with mohawk ind."
bad,"I was hired for one position, and after being hired and quiting my other job they told me that they had in house filled the position I was hired for and offered me a lower paying position which I had to take as I'd already gave notice to my other employer"
bad,It's a good place to work but I would not goo back because the preach safety but when it comes down to running they don't care if the machine is about to fall apart they will not let you shut it down and fix it and if it does go down they want you to fix if the fastest wash possible they don't care if Its fixed right or not as long as its running that's all they care about.
bad,"I find it hard to write negative reviews, so I'll focus on the positives:  It's nearly impossible to get fired.  Several people within my team have not been seen since I've been hired, the CIO included.  Though it's mandatory that all employees work at the closest office, I find that is only enforced for a handful of people.  It;s also nearly impossible to get training or tuition reimbursement, as this comes out of department budget.  When the budget gets decreased year after year and headcount plummets, things get a bit difficult to get approved.  I've been waiting several years for a bootcamp or online training, and I had to pay for it myself.  No reimbursement plan, no talk of advancement."
bad,"I have worked for Mohawk for well over 10 years.  At one time it was a great company however in the last few years management has made extremely poor decisions which have created a very poor and unpleasant work environment.  Employees are no longer valued but a number.  Promotions are only given to those ""in the right circle"" regardless of years service or qualification.   Some have special privileges such as late arrivals, long lunches and leaving early if they come to the office at all while other are not allowed.  Don't expect honesty as 99% of management are experts of deception.  "
bad,this job does not let you take breaks working over 12hrs a day poor training benefits could have been better.The  building I worked had no A/C or heat
bad,a typical day at work is stagnant and required to stay in one place to work all night. I've learned a lot about manufacturing and management operations. The work place culture in not equally balanced.  The hardest part of the job is being promised a job in another department making more money and the management in that department decided to place another employee in that job at the last minute and told me that after I was offered the job I now did not have the higher paying job anymore.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of my shift.
bad,"Mohawk drives self-motivation and asks for cost-savings ideas, while deriving continuous improvement projects on quality and claims reduction.  All department managers are willing to help in new ideas and streamlining processes for the better of the company."
bad,"The work place is not dynamic but rather chaotic. The facility that I work in cannot keep a production schedule for stable for two days. "
bad,Worked for Mohawk a few years was a good paying job but not worth the bs. The owner son came in never worked in a mill and almost caused everyone they're job. Lack of hours no way to move up unless you do dirty politics. Constantly changing and waning more and more with no increase In pay.
bad,Good ol’ boy mentality. If you’re not related or a constant suck up forget about advancement. Females in leadership positions don’t stand a chance because they’re afraid of retaliation if they are smarter than their bosses. There are very few true leaders in the organization so everyone and everything is managed.
bad,They just don't have it together. The past four years they have eliminated the jobs of the most useful people in management. Lots of tricks and deception from management the past four years. Safety is a joke! They put it all on the safety manager and he is 70 years old. Between talent lost and eliminated the place is a shell and the biggest joke!
bad,"Management issues, buddy buddy system strongly applied. If you don’t know the right people you’ll never get anywhere. The human resources department is a joke."
bad,the Danville plant is a high stress plant. there is not enough people to perform the work and they are always looking for way to take more out of the production areas. managers have no ownership of the out comes in the areas they are over. when performing any task be prepared to receive negative feed back only.  all mechanical issues are employees fault even when PM schedules are not followed.
bad,Company only cares about the numbers.  People is not something they focus on.  Management does not typically interact with their team to help develop them in to the employees they desire.  Management doesn't care about the opinions of others.
bad,This is a good first company to work for after college. I would not recommend working for this company if you have work experience as it is difficult to thrive within this culture.
bad,"The Lead is a young minded person who lashes out and talks down to her employees when a machine breaks down or production isn't running as smoothly as expected. I watched her call people names and push workers to the brink of heat exhaustion. The hours were great, the coworkers were great, but the lead was not professional at all."
bad,They put way too much on their current employees and make them work 10 hours a day 7 days a week and not really any time off. That is hard to do especially with small children. I am in constant fear of losing my job if I have to leave early or take a Saturday or Sunday off. I've been there for a year and a girl who has barely been there 90 days got an advancement because her family is in upper management.
bad,poor work place n management 12 hour weekends no overtime difficult to move up chain or transfer dept. management favortses over people
bad,"very low standards from management, its not the best place to work benefits are not that great your just a number and not a human"
bad,Stay to yourself. Make sure production is met. You might see your supervisor twice a day. Hardest part of the job is when the product you are looking for is placed on the lost list and you can't find your supervisor to ask where the list is located. The enjoyable part would be all the overtime u can handle.
bad,"This company only cares about numbers. If you get any type of injury whether serious or not during your 90 days you will be terminated. I was hurt by getting my finger caught in a spindle. I stayed at work, and finished my shift, even worked the next shift just to be let go for getting hurt."
bad,I really needed employment at the time and really had no other option. I would not recommend this job to someone else.The environment wasn't too safe.
bad,"If you aren't part of the click, you won't last long. Discrimination is common, but not acknowledged publicly. "
bad,the company is currently down sizing an the future does not seem sure at this point.  expectations are unrealistic and the work culture is depressing at this point.
bad,"Fast-paced no problem but for 11.5 hours straight very tough and hard to keep employees. Last I heard turnover ratio was a whooping 44%. Try to adopt better incentives for people like instead of work a full year before receiving 40 hours vacation, maybe give 20 hours on 6 month anniversary. Most of the 44% are quitting before 1 year."
bad,"Quality was always 2nd or less you had two fight to get a good product Plant  manager push quanity over quality"
bad,"No opportunities for promotion here, my immediate supervisors were good but upper management in manufacturing is very narrow minded."
bad,"The Logistics department at Mohawk is unorganized and has no structure. Members of Sr. Management and above have no appreciation of it's employees. The turnover rate in the last 2 years has been astounding. Employee ideas are disregarded with no attempt. So many people have been ""let go"" and their job duties have been assigned to remaining employees with no direction or compensation. An employee can do numerous things right or correct in a day, but one thing not done or a mistake being made, they are basically exploited for it amonst other employees and told they are not right for the job and told their opportunity for advancement is nonexistant. Human Resources is sneaky and can not be trusted when an employee goes to them in confidence when resolution is wanted. Sr. Management and above asks it's employees to do things that are known to be wrong to the employee but they do it anyway, and when the issue is brought to the employees manager, the manager doesn't side with the employee or back his/her decision and disciplines the employee for doing what they were told to do. Ethical and moral values is not something that is practiced at Mohawk. Employees there are not treated fairly and not appreciated for what they do.Mohawk is a far cry from what it once was, it is really a shame and it is sad that a person can't ask the ones that have been there for a long period of time, because those types of ""dedicated"" employees have been ""let go"" and told that ""this isn't for you"" or ""time has outgrown you"". Loyalty no longer is employed at Mohawk"
bad,"Too many supervisors trying to run the department"
bad,Mohawk was just a temp job didn't really pay much I run the sample line I also drive hyster when they need it me to I work with good people but they wasn't hireling people full time
bad,"Day shift was lead poorly. The young female lead was overbearing, rude, and did not do her job on her own, if at all. Night shift was lead by a single supervisor, good man, hard worker, but had too much work shoved on him. Co-workers were consistently good people and I even made long lasting friends. There is absolutely NO advancement if you arent a favourite or do too good at one particular job. You never know if youre working 4 hours or 16 because of how the workload is shifted. If you work on night shift, good luck."
bad,"Doesn't care about you, only wants you as an employee.  Been there 35 years and am being let go due to them shutting plant down.  No effort to relocate us to another facility, and those who have gotten ""offers"" from other plants have been offered jobs at an extremely cut rate per hour.  I was offered something almost $7 less an hour than I make now, and ITS STILL WITH MOHAWK."
bad,A typical day as a Territory consisted of appointments with your customer base and growing the territory by either cold calling or selling more to existing customers Pricing correctly in the market and product pull through were of key importance for distributor customers.
bad,"Working at Mohawk is very stressful. You work more than 40 hours a day without good pay. You have to work at a very fast pace, and they only gave you 30 min lunches which was very bad."
bad,"Long hours with hardly any breaks, very hot in summer months. Fast paced and demanding. Very high turnover rate and low employee morale. Upper management does not allow enough time to train new hires adequately which results in poor performance."
bad,"12-hours is a long time to be on your feet. The work is very hard and requires a lot of pulling, bending, and reaching. It's also very hot and uncomfortable to work as well."
bad,"I was able to pay my bills and eat. Other than that, I would not work here again. Anyone who decides to work here, I would suggest not divulging any personal information to anyone. Everyone complains daily."
bad,Concerned  with direction of company and how employees are being treated by senior management.???????????????????????????????????????????
bad,"I was a supervisor there for several months. I would not get clear directions on what was expected, one manager would want me as a hands on supervisor the other manager would want me as a supervisor leading the team letting them do the work. They are trying to improve by bringing in a people to train supervisors and management how to talk to people but a lot of backstabbers and people who really are there for a paycheck along with poor moral really makes it hard to make a difference. I left the first chance I got."
bad,It was very unmanaged. They did not have steady work or hours. And the management was a joke they had no discipline or any consequences. I would not suggest anyone work there
bad,"Sadly, after many years of working here, the logistics department continues to falter. Continued management changes and the perceived lack of understanding of what the drivers must deal with on a daily basis have made this company a nightmare to work for. There is little to no communication between management and the workers at all levels. The benefits are slowly going by the wayside as well."
bad,"Mohawk is a great place to work,its just that is to hot and in the summer you really have to stay hydrated and you could change your level of work many jobs more money"
bad,Company is kind of up and down as far as culture and pay.  Benefits are fairly good but management is a huge concern. Logistics are not a good operation making it very challenging to take direction.
bad,"My experience was decent, the upper management was very one sided and did not listen to the concerns of their employees. There were a few in the management team that saw the need for change, but didn't know how to implement it. The environment was friendly overall, but they lacked any advancement unless you wanted to go into sales."
bad,"All you have to do is look around or go to"
bad,Would go back if they only go to 8 hours. The management isn't always on same track. Supervision and department manager are not always on the same page. If something happens you are always wrong and not the managers. But even with that being said I think I would have stayed if we can do 8 hours.
bad,"The pay at Mohawk was good, but it’s so hot & not much room for advancement depending on which plant you work in. Management was a joke, problems went unsolved, again all depends on which plant you go to. Money is worth it though."
bad,The company is located in a growing town with great people.  They have a lot to offer someone with the desire to grow.  Many of the processes and procedures there are followed and known by all employees.
bad,"Mohawk is paying good, some workers are friendly, very poor managment. It's not all about mohawk.Mohawk is a good company  It's  about people who are in the position abusing their power and position. It's not about what u  know, its whom u know. A lot of people  was being hired and promoted but not much knowledgeable on the job. It is because  a buddy system. If you do something  right against the majority you will be laid off or fired. You need to  go with the flow so you can  keep your job. They don't care about worker, I is all about production. You  have no right to  defend your right or you will lose your job."
bad,"No real path for advancement. Associate program very unorganized. Upper management is shifted around continuously, and the main focus and direction changes daily. Large reduction in work force yearly with no placement within the company."
bad,"Mohawk has changed a lot over the years. Today it is a no-nonsense place where you work very hard for almost no recognition. It is good that you stay very busy so the time flies, but there is no social aspect to the work environment. It is all work, and then some more work. It's not fun anymore."
bad,Very stressful feel as your being watched and some one looking over your shoulder at all times.  Dedication and years mean nothing to this company.  Always let older people go.
bad,Very stressful with a lack of acknowledgment from management about the jobs that we're performed and achieved. Lots of unsafe acts that are overlooked from forklift drivers. Unlikeable point system.
bad,"Mohawk was an ok place to work if you felt like working your tail off for little pay and no further job advancement, they tell you that your pay checks are not based off of production, but with the machines always going down or having to get needles replaced, it's hard to want to stay at a place where you hardly get paid for what you worked"
bad,"Only worked at Mohawk for 6 months before a plant wide shift restructure put me on a lay off. Luckily I found another job before they actually laid me off.The way the place is managed I am amazed they can produce anything at all and if not for some of the production staff they probably wouldn't, Absoultly no direction or structure at all."
bad,"Very fast pace job."
bad,Very unsafe seen many people hurt and then seen one accident attempt to be covered up but that didn't work out for  them they have tried to make it safer since Mohawk has bought the place.
bad,"On a typical work day everyday is the same. I have to stand up for 12 hours straight. I get 4 short breaks per night. I'm constantly working u can't go outside to get any fresh air. I think the management need to do a better job in letting the employees to do overtime because times are hard. I don't really say anything to anybody else because I don't want to cause any problems with any of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is standing up for 12 hours without sitting down except for breaks but somehow I manage to do it, The most thing I enjoy about my job is being off every other weekend."
bad,"The people that I worked with were good people to work with.  However, I didn't care for the micro management,  I have been in the customer service field for the past 20 yrs.  I enjoy working with the public, and handling their issues and concerns"
bad,"This company is alright to work for besides the pay rates for the job you are doing and the 60+hours a week in over 100 degree non-circulated areas, when you have families, then being laid off the next week. Work was not steady, and benefits weren't that well in comparison to other companies I have worked for."
bad,"Everyone has favs. If you was in with the boss and needed help on your job there would usually be no problem getting that help. If no one liked you, then you were really on your own. Workplace would have been better if everyone helped each other out."
bad,"Regardless of your position, you must watch your back at all times.  Job security is based on who you know and telling management what they want to hear, whether right or wrong.  If you ask questions, beware."
bad,"Fast pace."
bad,"Rise fast or be the next one out the door.  The place is savage.  Management does everything in their power to make every job harder than it needs to be.  They will cite, 'safety', but really they do it just to make people quit.  There must be some financial gain for mohawk in making working conditions so harsh that people quit, but that's out of my knowledge area."
bad,"Worked Graveyard shift, The people where great.I have heard the change the worst parts of the job. Can't say what it like now.Have not been therefor a few years."
bad,"Mohawk is a great company from the outside looking in. Wages are  good.  Growth is primarily through acquisitions.  "
bad,I feel as though Mohawk did a very poor job with my hiring process. They did not speak to me about benefits at all. I feel like I didn't have enough training before they began holding me strictly accountable for mistakes that are naturally going to happen.
bad,"Hourly pay is decent for the market I was in. "
bad,"The work was fine. The benefits kept decreasing. The management was changing and hard to work with at points. The constant changing of corporate safety was a nightmare, always a new person, and everything had to be filed a different way, A total waste of resources. I had many employees and some were great and others came and went, but we enjoyed the challenge. The underhandedness of mid management was very hard to deal with. There was NO trust in their dealings with managers."
bad,"Always cutting jobs and asking for more production. When failing to meet production goals, shuts down department and lays everyone off with no real effort to place anyone."
bad,I think the place needs More leadership because the thing I saw was that the leadership there didn't care about the area this pant is in. Some of the tech. they had there will never be a good one.
bad,"There are a lot of knowledgeable, loyal, and hard working employees that are good people in the lower ranks of management (Coworkers).  Areas for improvement would be in upper management and HR functions.  The hardest part of the job was seeing the culture of morals and values in a certain area of the company eroding to a culture of deceit, dishonesty and lies.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the first 11 years,  the last 2 years was a much different story."
bad,"I have not worked for this company since 2010, but in the 12 years that I did work there I built very strong relations to co-workers and management.  A tyical day at work was very fast paced and required absolute accuracy. "
bad,Too much going on at once. I don't see how it's not a safety issue. Not balanced like it use to be. I use to be okay working out there till they started to want to compete with China.
bad,It’s great if you want a LOT of overtime (7 days a week for months in a row) not so good if you don’t . Management has favorites. Do not work in tufting dept. if you don’t want to work 7 days a week
bad,"It was ok just fast Pace work, I stayed on my feet for most of the time , production base so the line was moving quick unless when we switch styles or the machine goes down other than that it’s ok to work"
bad,A typical workplace in the company.  Some days ok and some not.  I understand Mohawk but the upper management is not that great.  Have a great day.  Thank you
bad,"Everyone wants to be your supervisor, and it seems as if everyone is. The company has no real structure when it comes to leadership. They really don't know how to utilize their team members effectively."
bad,As a utility you’re at the bottom of the ladder and the manager only looks out for herself. I got looked over several times for promotions for people who had been there less time with less experience. She plays favorites and never goes through with any promises she makes. She won’t let you advance.
bad,"Management was very poor, communication was horrible. Overtime was not allowed, and if you had any hours over 35 or 40, you were made to cut hours until overtime was eliminated."
bad,"Heat transfer operator is the job Im paid to do. My supervisor has me train the new folks that walks thru the door.  Its hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The typical day is do you meeting to find out what machine your gonna run. Then your expected to get anywhere from 800 to 1000 mats printed a day. The flock is itchy and is horrible to work around. Its slippery and if your not careful you can fall. Our safety is a joke. For example our safety guy stand in the walk way and you have to put yourself in danger because hes busy on his phone or talking to other people. Or my personal favorite is another supervisor will walk by the dock doors and be on his phone not paying attention to the hysters zooming by him. "
bad,"Great pay, not such a great work atmosphere. Too much pressure from supervisors yet you're given little to work with. It's a contradiction all in itself"
bad,"start at 6 am every morning, 2 breaks a day, had to bust tail all day, was not really aloud to take a bath room/water break, a 10 min break was only 5 mins and lunch break was 25 mins and had to clock out."
bad,"Job work/ Life balance was okay. Overall I had to work swing shift and a lot of over time. I spent more time at work then off. Compensation/Benefits with Cigna was not good, but the benefits was good especially short time long time ."
bad,I worked there almost 25 years it a ok place to work i enjoyed working there the pay is good  the people on the floor are good to work with
bad,"I learned working most of all of the equipment, I enjoyed my co-workers and supervisors, the hardest part of the job was the bad material that caused the machines to clog up which would slow down production."
bad,"Hard to move up in the company. Everyone makes the same wage within departments...raises are not given based on performance. Plant manager does well with employees relations. Heavy work loads, inconsistent work hours from week to week."
bad,I would go in to work every day around 6am and would not leave until 9pm. I spent the entire day in meetings trying to resolve problems that needed my presence to resolve. Management doesn't care about their employees and sees everyone as replaceable. Co-workers were wonderful but all of them overworked and underpaid. The job cost me family time and was not worth it. It caused me undue stress and was forced to go on antidepressants.
bad,I enjoyed working there. Management didn't tell you the truth about what's going on at the plant. I learned a lot from my supervisor in quality.   I learned a lot on how to do charts and graphs.
bad,"I was working as part of the new IT PMO.  The major problem was lack of understanding of the PMO mission outside of the IT department."
bad,Most enjoyable part of the job was operating the forklift and the learning experience of moving and locating material through out the warehouse.  The  hardest part of the job is dealing with the racist environment.
bad,"I like my job but I felt like they looked for something to get onto you abt very stressful. You was always looking over your shoulder . I love helping customer ,placing orders and talking with all the different people and personalities."
bad,"A typical day at Mohawk is filled with bad language and insults about people of color."
bad,Certain departments are real good to work for and some are shameful to work for  . Plant management are clueless to how thangs really work
bad,"The employees could get flooring at discounted prices. The flooring is of good quality and they have a variety to choose from, and you can pick it up within days of ordering."
bad,I have never seen so many VPs in one office.  It is easy to get caught up in a power struggle.  The culture is very much built around fear.  Getting chewed out is common place.  And the HR department does not help the employees.
bad,"very cotporate driven. was a 60 hour work mweek. vacations frowned upon. Mohawk has little formal training, and works from a position of fear. You never really know when the ""next"" restructure is coming"
bad,Alright place to work..  The pay was great just bad hour. But overall I would refer Mohawk to a friend.. I just needed more flexible hours.. I’d rate a 5
bad,A typical day at mohawk was a hard long 12 hours. I did learn how to operate the machine. The hardest part of the job was when every machine you run has a break out and yarn blowing out the wall.
bad,"It was an okay place to work. Not much to do as an intern. Learning new things did not happen much, but i did learn some things there. A typical day at work was following around electricians."
bad,"Making sure the carpet was straight was the hardest part of my job. Everyone works hard and gets the job done in time at Mohawk. My most enjoyable part of this job was knowing my machine was running good. Management is strict, but you need that in every workplace."
bad,Stressful job machine run good for a couple hours than all hell break lose
bad,I would not reccommend thus place of employment to anyone who does not like to be disrespected giving demands instead of asking n a proper way schedule changing from one day to the next not set schedule etc....
bad,"A great starter company, and a great place to learn if you are able to teach yourself. This company appreciates hard work but sometimes expectations exceed reality."
bad,Its hot in there. i learned how to run a machine. the management was cool at times. the co workers would help you. the hardest part about my job was running 3 machines at 1 time.the fun part was the days off.
bad,"It is a good place to work, but just ask/forced to work too many hours. I have learned from there, to always pay attention on the job. An accident could happen any time."
good,"this workplace was fun, hours got cut and i got laid off.  good place to work if your very outgoing."
good,"Treat you like a slave, only care about production, not scared to tell you that overtime is mandatory at the last minute or a penalty to your attendance"
good,"Micro managed manager"
good,"Its a job, with ok pay but they overwork you for the money many times doing the job of 3 to 4 people people because the keep laying off people and making other employees stretch themselves even thinner.  This causes a drop in quality, which they fire the overworked employee for."
good,"I work 12 hr shifts, 2 days on 2 days off and every other weekend. I run a machine that makes carpet and in a day I work on this machine, mend the carpet and dolph it in the floor. I really enjoy a lot of my co-workers and some of my supervisors but over all the management is not very good. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the machine running while working on it. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with."
good,It's all about the above average pay until you realize the money is just misdirection while they steal your life away. Apart from the money the best it gets is having a social life outside of home. Mohawk fails in every other regard.
good,the supervisor in my department is very pushy and they expect you to do the jobs of 2-3 people on a daily basis! The department i work in had 3 shifts last year and cut back to one shift this year and they think you should be able to produce the same amount of product only working one shift. It was a pretty good place to work when i started in 2009 but things have went down hill and in the fall and winter business slows down and you will not get 40 hours a week.
good,Trainers walk around like they own the place and plant mgr has no personality and micromanages. Thats why they have so many open positions. There is discrimination at the plant and they enforce safety issues on some and not on others.
good,a very unorganized company loaded with favortism and double standards you really earn your money they promote the wrong people its not senority or experiance
good,little time for advancement.  Pay is not equally dispersed through employees.
good,it was great place to work but I was going no we’re at the company needed  I worked for 7 years  night shift needed to change to day shift for a better health and a better environment
good,"This place need a new management view on how the employee see management, they can fired you, by your skin color and never even move up to other position, most the folks are white management, no a single black person running the show, there's seem to be a correlation. where the superintendent only chose to hire if they the same color, if you skin color is black you will rush on anything, if you are white, you treating like kings, give job advancement with no experience, they fire a lead tech two weeks ago, who was there more 10 years, they gave the job to a new hire (white) with only 4 months, it just seem unfair but no one say anything because they can fired you like that,"
good,"Flooring company's are rated to have under average pay, and I found that to be true!  They also work you very hard for that paycheck, so you not be bored.  Conversely, they expect you to have higher than normal output and are frequently cracking the whip.  I was not in with management and so my upward mobility stopped even though I was working smart and hard.  I had to leave to get higher pay and more responsibility.   I learned a LOT here however.  Great for newer techs."
good,"Mohawk is a good start out company to build your resume with, it's good for learning new skills, but keep in mind, it's all about who you know, not what you know. So many of us get skipped over for job advancements due to the good ol' ""Buddy System"". Also if a job is listed on the work boards, it's been said from management level employees that they've already got their intended hire for the position picked out, which is already unfair to all the rest who show interest."
good,"Not much to say, not much to get excited about.  Management didn't talk to employees or listen to them either. Other areas might be better but this was my experience."
good,It was an ok place to work at. They just don't train you properly and safely on the shift i was on. The creeler lead supervisor treatment towards people is rude and ugly if you are not one of the people that kisses up to him
good,"Nice company, but too many related and unsupervised hires.  Company is corrupt at the Bennettsville plant in many peoples eyes."
good,The benefits  and pay scale  is lacking  for people  hoping to advance. I couldn't recommend  this company  to anyone unless they were desperate  for a job.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work - I was salaried and tried to follow the policies as written in the manuals and handbooks.  However, Corporate management would not follow the rules or bend the rules to far.  I made decisions based on facts and policies and when employees started to complain no one would back you up."
good,Very successful company but job security is not the best.  Benefits and pay are good.  Enjoyed my work and enjoyed the people I worked with.  There is good opportunity for those who are willing to make the sacrifices to stand out.
good,"Everyone was made to do more with less. At first some of these positions needed four or five people, they will cut it down to one without any"
good,"Good place to work, just overworked sometimes. Some management personnel really do not care about situations. Most of the supervisors are very approachable and receptive of your input, but management is not the same."
good,"Typical Day - working shoulder to should with field personnel to achieve target KPIs"
good,It's a ok place to work. The 12 hours seem long but I got use to them. The only thing is we can't go outside but some times u need that fresh air to wake up. I think they should have a smoking area for people that smoke. The breaks could be a lil longer. If they can they should try better was to keep the place a little cooler cause it does get very hot. I feel like they should also raise the pay a little cause it's a lot of work for the money they pay u.
good,I should have never taken this job. I was let go from Shaw and needed a job. I have never been treated so unfair by management in my whole career. I was held at a different standard than everyone else from day one. I did enjoy working with the employees.
good,"Worked as a Production Manager for 5 years manufacturing reconstituted rubber tires into Environmentally friendly Designer Door Mats for numerous customers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowes, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, etc. Faced with an 85% turnover rate, 30% failing rate in deliveries,  and a 75% Off-Quality margin initially, the state of the manufacturing environment was very unstable, unreliable, and unsafe."
good,-A typical day at work consists of hard labor
good,"Pay and benefits are great compared to other opportunities in this area, but morale, job security, and management are not. They show no genuine concern or appreciation for their employees on a day to day basis. There is extreme inconsistancy in the execution and enforcement of policies and procedures."
good,Fast Pace environment with constant changes. Schedule changes frequently based on the workflow. Management thrives on micromanaging all leadership roles.
good,Like high school with dangerous stone. Manager cheats on his wife barely shows and ignored drug use. numerous dangerous situations.Be safe Be careful.
good,"The working conditions were very good for a 300,00 sq ft warehouse. All the equipment was keeped up to date and maintained. From forklifts to computers."
good,"Good pay, good benefits, good co workers but very bad mamagment. Will litterally get rid of anyone for anything and are constantly looking for a reason to fire people."
good,THere is no room for advancement at Mohawk Industries.  They will literally fire you and hire you back so that you lose all your vaction time and senority
good,slavery got to be a yes man and feel like you can't do no better. threaten about your job everyday. supervisor lie on employees if they don't like the
good,"Management lacks the ability to communication expectations, changes in procedure. Management shows favoritism blatantly. Consistent policy implementation and accountability is inconsistent."
good,Come in at 6 in the morning. Begin rolling carpet of all sizes. Most people did not really talk. Culture of kind of negative and depressing. The hardest part of the job would be when you got the big carpets and once it was rolled you would have to single handedly pick it up and get a bag around it.
good,"Management and HR did not communicate properly with the employees. When I was personally injured on the job, I was told by my manager to continue working in order to get the product out the door because there were ""only two pallets left"". So "
good,"Pay cuts putting you into jobs you didn't bid on, removal of bonus system from hourly staff to give salary staff raise. Since the new plant manager to over the entire plant moral has gone down. All policies have changed removal of sick days you get an occurrence i you get sick"
good,I was an employee for 20 years. Current management on every level has no respect or consideration for experienced employees.
good,Once your on nights there is no way to get off and on day shiftsame thing day in and day out if you like rouintine this is the place to work
good,"Promotions only given to select few.  High salaries, no bonuses."
good,The direct supervisors were great guys. As far as learning something new daily wasn't an option. Overall management was a poor excuse for management.
good,I enjoyed working there. Quality of work was good. Great place to advance your career.
good,"It's a descent place to work,the plant is in a bad part of town. Equipment is really old and alot of it needs to be replaced or upgraded. Safety is pretty good."
good,I was a job but not a Great one. I didn’t have room for advancement and I didn’t get an opportunity to get overtime it was extremely Frowned Upon. But it was no touch freight which I liked and I learned alot
good,Flooring company that pays good for the area. Environment hot in the summer and the hours long. Not bad if you get to stay in position hired for often get moved around
good,"I was fired when I was forced to defend myself from a former violent employee that had already slapped and beat up a homosexual employee for making a statement that had nothing to do with him. They rehired him and never gave him extra training to deal with his problems with other ppl not like him, why Mohawk rehired him is beyond me."
good,"A lot of favoritism among employees."
good,Moahawk is an alright work place but it is not somewhere I wanna be for the rest of my life. My dad has been in public safety for 20 years now and I think I would love doing that.
good,"The day went by fast because there was never any ""down-time"" until break. I pulled rolls of carpet from the warehouse for the diehouse so it was great training for my forklift operations."
good,"will be a great place to work once reorganized "
good,"Male dominated Management with very good old time network in place.  Health benefits are minimum Obama care at a high premium. $600 plus for family with $6000 plus deductible and $13,0000 plus out of pocket maximum for family plan."
good,There are a lot of options within the company just depends which path you want to go. I have had some good times and bad times here. Has options to help you grow
good,"Stress levels in this job are extreme. You are micromanaged and expected to consistently operate the machine with minimum waste. Operators should expect to lift over 12,000 lbs a work day, so the job is most physically intense in all of carpet manufacturing. "
good,Long hrs family life hard to balance did not compensate like I had planned it would with 3 on 2 off 4 on 3 off some times not even 40 hrs per week pay period
good,Mohawk has turned into a awful place to work the management is really bad people are so rude and disrespectful nothing is appreciated working for them anymore over the past 6 months it has been the worse company to work for
good,"Loved the coworkers but management was rough, very biased and nitpicking. Once they decide they dont like you, you are out and no matter what you do you cannot be redeemed.  Again alot has probably changed,, hopefully, as i worked there 6 years ago."
good,"Decent place to work.  Lacks strong management team. But, manufacture a decent product.  Quality suffers.  EH&S is a issue.  Constant accidents and recordables."
good,I hated it.  Just not my cup of tea listening to people yell and scream and curse at me.  Didn't like not being able to move around and being confined to a chair and phone 8 hrs a day.
good,People are numbers and pawns in a rat race to make the most possible money that can be made with the least resources and people to do the jobs. You can be a hero today and a nobody the next.
good,"Spend 15 years there. A typical work day is spending all day on your feet. Very dirty job. If you have no personal life then this may be a job for you.  Management is terrible, somedays you didn't  know who the boss was.  Supervisor spent most of their day talking or on the internet, and didn't know what was going on, on production floor."
good,You never know if your going to have to work until the last minute. Supervisors take advantage of power and nothing is really done to solve problems. Its completely hectic...but decent weekly pay.
good,"It's all about who you know and not what you know at this plant which is not always a good  thing when depend solely on production.  There is no sense of leadership, communication, or respect here either."
good,Supervisor and management was not seen very much on the production floor. 
good,"Checking emails, helping sales reps get product assigned to orders, facilitate meetings for safety and company training, work inventory reports, performance metrics."
good,They don't communicate or do the job full. Leave the job any kind of way for the next shift. Management does nothing about it. The pay isn't enough for what we are doin
good,Good pay unorganized management mandatory 7 days a week very strict policy let people influence the management good benefits Human resource management is good and listens
good,"No help from boss in Flower Mound. Oversee two shifts; day shift and midnight shift which was difficult to keep people on. Hey Coloradoans, you  can't smoke weed and get or keep a job."
good,Worked here 2 years if you get the right job its great if not its far too demanding and you work far too many hours sometimes 7 days a week for months at a time
good,"hardest part about the job was coming after a lazy worker.the best part was the company really cared about safety,about your well being and they also would reward you for your good work"
good,"When you come in to work each day, you never know what you might encounter. There were no preventative maintenance done on machines. Jobs were undermanned at times."
good,"Nice overall people to work with get alone with each other more like a family oriented type group,sharing, caring,help each other out on their job when needed"
good,"They already know how many rolls they need shipped, wrapped and re-rolled before your shift starts. They'll tell you no over time before your shift starts. And at the end they'll ask you stay over. They'll also tell you after your shift on Friday or before that you're staying over Saturday. And come Monday the cycle starts again. No one wins, except Mohawk."
good,Overall good company to work for. a lot of changing procedures and bending of policies. Confusing directives with absolute abandonment of responsibility of decisions made.
good,"Need more progressive thinkers that can move them passed their limited vision. In addition, the company is held back from moving forward by the overwhelming amount of corporate politics."
good,Great innovation and design.  Exceptional products but poor culture and business plan changes daily.  Management constantly changing with each change  having new direction.  Upper management makes promises that are not being kept.
good,"This job is not for everyone,if you like long hours and below average salary pay then this job is for you.It really wasnt bad except for the upper management catering too some older supervisors"
good,Not much sales support. Will not hire more inside sales positions. Doing more with less culture. Need to invest in the sales force unfortunately not willing to do so. Not willing to change with the times. Competition is beating us up.
good,I was within my 90 days and i had missed 2 days because i had court when i first started an that wasnt sopossed to be held against me but it was and i missed 1 day because my car messed up. An the 3 time time i went 2 the hospital because i got sick and i had a doctors note an they still fired me which wasnt right i was a great worker for them but mohawk dosnt care your just another number to them
good,I hated this job they didn't care if you was contagious with a very bad virus they wanted you at work no matter what. They slaved you hard for such little money.
good,I don't have any thing bad to say about this company would I work there again yes.They let you work all the over time you want.Most of the people were friendly and nice to work with
good,Being a  weaver I was wore out whole 8 hours because you're constantly running and your are on production I lost a great amount of weight without even trying some and we don't have a breakout person so when you are going to break your machine is still running you come right back to where you left
good,For the area in which it is located Mohawk is most likely the best paying place to be employed. But as far as ability to balance a job and home life it has to be the worst place I've ever worked at. Also there is an unbelievable amount of favoritism present in the company.
good,I don't know if i have enough words to express how bad this company is to work for. Low pay and never knowing where they are headed as a company is all I can say.
good,"High stress, long hour work environment.  Good compensation at the manager and executive levels.  Becoming more political as the company increases in size and complexity.  Low value of work/life balance.  No consistent career growth and advancement strategy."
good,"It was more of a fun job that no one took serious, which was fun at times but i dont like being behind. I got to work on my own an thats when i do my best work."
good,Its a job that is very simple to learn and master. The management is not very good but it is a place that you can always get your 40 hours.
good,I don't know what to say about the company.   I have worked for the company for 3 years.  It's hard to get hired on with this company. The call center is a high stressed job.  If you can't deal with random personalities then its definitely not for you.  As long as you do your job you will be fine.
good,"This is a very large company. In this company we have a lot of different divisions trying to make very important decisions.  Unfortunately, that ends up hurting the common goal and sometimes the bottom line.  The hardest part of my job is trying to convince upper management that we are pursuing the wrong goals to accomplish tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers.  We continue to learn from each others experiences from out different work backgrounds."
good,"Alright place to work especially if you want to make some overtime. Management though played favorites and so you had no equal opportunities especially in a redneck good ol' boy small town. Besides that, I loved my job on the forklift."
good,"Good on the start up. Some key positions offer too much stress for the pay rate given.   Unfair management were I'm at, but I do know a lot of good people at Mohawk in management roles.  Mismanagement of budget & human resources at a certain place within this company. "
good,"It was a nice place to work,the mangers was easy to get alone with,they paid good money to workers and sent them to school"
good,Working with national account customers was always enjoyable with never a dull moment; lots of multi-tasking
good,"Great People to work with, awesome management!! Liked the job i was doing with the company. Office closed, jobs moved to GA."
good,"A day at work is very repetitive, come in.. take calls, go home. But the real pain is the support they give their employee's. They don't. The attendance policy is whack and most of their policies are gray. Management will do what they can to help you, but they are restricted by upper management a lot. Most of the co-workers are great, you create a little family with them. The hardest part of the job is adhering to your 15 minute breaks as they give them to you, when they give them to you.. not before or after. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with."
good,"The job itself is not hard by any means. As long as you are a focused worker who stays on task to aquire the production needs, you will have no problem keeping your position. Upper management tends to lean on favoritism. If you give any bad impression, it will not only stick with you, but it will hold you back from any advancement. People who give a good impression, regardless if they're capable of the job at hand, will advance. Out of the 2+ years I've worked here, I've seen it happen time after time."
good,Hired as temp through agency. Was placed on everything and anything they had. Not very organized at the time. Someone mislabeled a ton of flooring boxes and the temps got fired because the boss had to fix the problem. Not very good training.
good,"Never ending changes within the Mohawk corporation.  Employees come and go along with managers, etc.  Fast paced environment.  Must be someone that is able to keep up with demands of clients."
good,It wasnt that bad of a place to work. I truly think if they would have had different management it would not have shut down. And they switched schedules for 8 hrs and 12hrs to much.
good,The job is easy to learn. The management is horrible. You can do your job perfectly and still end up getting in trouble. The company is filled with drama.
good,"A good workday would be going to work and having all your material to run productively. Also, the machinery to be running good without constant breakdowns."
good,It's not the worst place I've worked and I'm sure other positions in different departments or locations could be better. My biggest problems were the long hours with only one 30min lunch standing on the same platform for over 11hrs a day
good,"Traveling to assigned accounts daily "
good,I was employed there many years. The job was really good however  the supervisor wasn’t fair and the managers lie and don’t defend the employees . I was led to believe I was being terminated but they put on my separation papers that I had quit
good,I learned how to work well with others. I also learned to communicate well with others. I enjoyed doing different jobs per day. The part of my job I did not like was having to stay on my co-workers to come back to their jobs on time. If they were late I would miss my break.
good,Mohawk is a manufacturing company.  It is shift work.  Other than that not a bad place to work for.  Steady employment.  Factory based job some excel and others do not.
good,I work at Mohawk and if you're not Spanish you get treated like a slave there's too much to do with one person that's the reason why we can't keep people.Im on my way out due to my hand i had surgery on and I been trying to transfer but they keep giving me the run around.
good,the worst part of working at Mohawk is the amount of customers that don't have proper equipment to unload your truck.a roll of say 15x30 carpet weighs a [pretty fair amount and you have to unload that by hand
good,"I learned of a lot of favoritism and lies with management at the time I was there,other co workers were great to work with,some not all, lot of turnover also, customers very demanding, very little patients with company, whichmade it hard for warehouse workers and truck drivers at that time"
good,"My job at Mohawk was very stressful, but very rewarding.  Very aggressive goals and deadlines daily.  Most everyone seemed to enjoy their job but there were several complaints about production standards and expectations.  Some of the expectations seemed out of reach for some employees but they still tried hard to get the expected numbers daily.  This in itself was stressful and trying to help everyone to achieve our goals.  The hardest part of my job was having to discipline someone for not meeting requirements when I knew they were actually trying.  I always felt like I was pushing them out the door.  On the other hand, watching someone start off knowing nothing and within a few short weeks being one of your top performers was very rewarding.  I worked with and coached many employees who in the beginning I thought possibly wouldn't make it long term, but they proved me wrong and I really enjoyed that part.  The main thing I learned as a manager is to not take anything for granted.  You should always check to be sure what you are thinking about a certain situation is actually the case and not think someone else will just take care of it.  Being organized and punctual is a very important item also."
good,"They will work salary exempt people to death. They're benefits for hourly employees are horrible but from I understnd, it is the standard for the industry in THAT area."
good,Mohawk is one of the safest possible places you could be employed. They are very cut throat when it comes to safety standards. Decent pay and good benefits
good,is an okay place to work to much turn over and upper management does not care about the people on the floor working to do the work. to much turn over with upper management move people around to much no job security.
good,"Mohawk is a good place to work at but communication between managers and employees need to be MUCH MUCH BETTER. If there is something good or bad, the employees need to know."
good,great people bad work life balance.  that is all i have to say about this and I'm only continuing to type because of the minimum requirement any other questions
good,"Very fast paced, and busy. I learned the system we used for processing orders. Management was difficult, the supervisor was great to deal with, but we never really had any ability to talk with other managers."
good,"I don't believe there is enough opportunity for advancement. The working environment is pleasant but there are some positions at this company, once you are in them there is little or no chance for promotion."
good,"Must use time efficiently , work safely,  work well with others, and move alot of carpet.  Lots of changes going on right now.  Headed in right direction to sustain a successful future."
good,I applied checks to invoices and worked on internet payments. I worked on month end reports and with a team. I did monthly sales and balancing as well.
good,My boss at Mohawk Industries advised me I had to earn respect. Mohawk bought out IVC in Dalton GA and I do not recommend going to work there.  There was a lot of rude people there and the bosses let people fuss at one another in the office and in front of customers on the phone.
good,"A typical day is constant calls back to back for 8 hrs.  Customer Services related issues."
good,I went in and checked all the machines to make sure everything was running. I worked on my P.M. machines and anything that went down throughout the night. I helped give breaks to help production stayed running.
good,Not a bad place to work.but took job because I needed something asap while looking for a more suitable job.I work 3rd shift Monday night thru Saturday morning
good,The job is ok.its just the ppl.And I'm wanting to learn different things I like the 12 hours and I love my job but there r changing every thing
good,"It was a very nice place to work, upper management was always ready to listen to any concerns or problems..  Employees were like family."
good,"It does not matter if you work hard or not, nothing gets noticed. You can work 2 times harder than one person and nothing is said. The person working hard doesn't get complimented and the person working slow does not get asked to work harder."
good,It was something different. But at this time i was also working another job as well. I had to learn something new so that took a few minutes.
good,Good hours and nice pay. You could work overtime if you preferred
good,"Mohawk Ind is an exceptional place to work.  I have worked in the Reliability Department for almost two years without any problem.  The management of the department was always on cue about any discrepancies or tools that we may have needed in order to complete the job at hand.  I enjoyed the travel to and from the different plants that were based across the southeast region of the United States.  The technical part of the job included taking trending data on motors and gearboxes as well as some crucial bearings along the lines.  The challenging part was identifying which units were going to fail.  Most of the equipment in use at Mohawk already exceeded the vibration limitations that are standard today.  I was also trained in other areas of Reliability; Airborne Ultrasound, Rotary Air Compressor Training, and Infrared Thermography.        "
good,"Long stressful, sweaty hours with very limited breaks. I learned how to be quick and be useful with my hands. My supervisor was temporary and a great supervisor in my opinion. Co-workers were okay, but I couldn't make many friends because they are mainly minorities that do not speak English. Hardest part of the job was that if you are not running or sweating then you're not doing something right. The best part of the job was that pay wasn't to bad."
good,I liked it and some of my managers and my coworkers were very helpful... However management lacked in the ability to manage...
good,sorting plactic bottles by color on an assembly line. running the pelletizer machine that melt plactic chips into pellets. driving hyster for all these jobs. all co-workers work as a team. the hardest part of the job is keepin up production an keeping waste down. the best part of the job is your job promotions are based on how hard you work not who you know.
good,I got to work anywhere from 15 to 30 mins prior to my shift so i could be briefed on anything i needed to know from the off coming shift we dealt with hundreds of visitors and truckers a day I loved my job i really enjoyed working there
good,"Layed off two times, still layed now. I have email HR. and all I was told is to look on the web to see what was out there."
good,"Well it's a good place to work in and they are really helpful with you they explain how things are done there they teach you every spot of the jobs that they have there ,and they have good trainers also."
good,My body is totally messed up after 20 years but I was able to provide for my family. The supervisors don't care about the employees and the owners definitely do not. I retired and they refused to let me work only 40 hours a week
good,Don't do it. Not a fun job. I hated every minute of it. The worst job experience I have ever had. They treat you terribly. Its not a good place to work.
good,Mohawk Industries was a company that primarily focused on safety of the work environment and of its employees. Benefits were a plus. The pay was decent with over-time available. A very informative company.
good,"In the beginning all was well and after about 3 months I began to notice some constant negative trends with equipment, management, and the routers.  Overall it began to bother me the way the company is operating.  The Phoenix branch is a small branch and it seems as though big Corporate in Atlanta does not put the necessary funds for equipment repairs and such."
good,"I don't have nothing to say about. On this company for my was,So So, buy I think was good, I was there and for me was good and I think this company is ok"
good,It a ok job but if the business starts getting slow of they start sending you home early or to other departments start looking for another job because they will tell you everything is good on Monday and lay you off on Wednesday without any notice
good,Just not where I want to be as a 19 year old. The pay is good but want to make something of myself and go to college. If you like working lomg day or nights and never have time say for yourself or family then this is the place for you.
good,It’s very hot and you have to be quick with your hand you may not get your break a lot and you get frustrated to easy  you work on you feet all night no sitting down they treat u well but they do a lot of lay off
good,"Not being counted as a person but as a number, difficult to feel part of a company that does not care about their employee just for production most of the time"
good,loved the job at the time then the mill I was working in was closing with jobs moving far away from where I lived.  Enjoyed my employment while I was there
good,"working at Mohawk has challenges, no one can decide who is going to give you direction,  No real job duties, always changing.  HR wanting all recognition, instead of allowing employees to get credit where it need to be."
good,Was the largest small company I have ever worked for. Politics were really bad between the technical teams located in different areas and different technical development areas.
good,Very fast pace hot temperature certain areas have be able to fix a mechine break down less than 10 mins must be able to stand for 12hrs or more must be able to work in got in cold temperatures
good,Paid very well but were to hard on their employees. Good benefits we had though and 401k loved that.and paid vacations . didnt get to move up in jobs much.
good,"Mohawk is a good place to work. sometimes a little harsh on employees. Mohawk is striving to turn world class 5 s. in preparation, Mohawk has started development plans."
good,Mohawk was a good place to work got kinda boring and also had to worry about the other people driving and operating their machines the correct way and keeping their equipment maintained.
good,It was a job with overtime at a moments notice. good people to work with in my department. dusty dirty atmosphere because of what is made there. No desire to return.
good,Same as I wrote for ricoh...Same people same job.I scanned documents and indexed them.Really enjoyed the people I worked with but will enjoy knowing new people
good,Mohawk was a decent place for me to start working after high school. It was local and the pay was fair for the time I worked there but not so much now
good,Mohawk could be a better place to work if management would show some appreciation to the employees for their hard work and dedication. Pay is slightly below average. the work is back breaking. I work at Mohawk Industries full-time (more than 11 years).
good,"If you want to live at  your job and feel like you are part of the machinery, then Durkan Commercial (Mohawk) is the place for you. Just go ahead and say goodbye to the family and move right in."
good,terrible management. unsafe working conditions and no care for quality of life. would not recommend to an enemy or friend. would be a good place to put a carpet mill.
good,I think that the upper management team should vote to put 2 people in packing/Warehouse again. I also think that other areas need more employees. They also need to take corrective action against employees who actually need it
good,"i had to check the cemicles for the boilers and air washers . "
good,Depending on what department you worked in the hours would be different. When I worked in shipping during the summer we worked 12hrs a day 7 days a week while other department would work 8 hrs a day 5-6 days a week
good,I would come into work that morning to operate the over-head monorail for the installation of warps in looms. I had PPE that must be worn for the operations of monorail.
good,Good job nice place to work at alright hours fast paced job half of the year it’s busy than the other half it’s very slow  it’s a 12 hour job it’s open 24 hours a day
good,"As I began to work for Mohawk it seemed great I moved up fast and started making decent money with benefits. But, the way the company ran was very stressful to say the least we had a line catch on fire and it threw production behind causing Mohawk to lose our biggest customers. So they had a big lay off and they gave me an * dollar an hour pay cut and then I was Laid off."
good,Mohawk is a ok company if you like working with out no health insurance or no pay vacation or pay holiday looking forward to get hired on with a really good company that's is long term career stable job with health insurance benefits .
good,Worked there when it was Burlington. Over the years when Mohawk took it over all the little perks like employees being able to purchase defective or off quality carpet went to the wayside now they sell all that to the highest outside bidder. Also lots of people that have worked there for years get overlooked or turned down for management positions. Instead they would rather put the worst people they can find in the building in these positions. Some who don't have children are have an ability to show empathy for thier employees. I wasn't the youngest one in my department as far as seniority was concerned but they let management get around the seniority bit and lay some of us off that the new department management had no use for.
good,A good place to work for. The place was upbeat and busy. Always going running lines nonstop. Really like the work and the people where good people tonqork with. But they closed the doors.
good,"The management changes often, and they tend to bring in talent from other organizations then build from within. Much more likely to leave and come back to advance."
good,You start of with stretches for as a daily safety requirement. Then you load the truck until the work load is complete. I learned product quality is important. The management was decent.
good,Nice place to work as long as you stay to your self and are comming there to work. there is a problem with getting the product you need in the department to compleat the task set before you. good pay and lots of over time.
good,It was ok they always wanted you to hurry up .I was in maintenance for a couple years always working on something they didn't let us weld much .and it was hard trying to get your vacation days they always wanted you there.
good,since ive been gone I heard they have new managers and they are constantly having shut downs and issues with osha if you need a job with benefits it fits the purpose
good,"Worked there for a year, was a nice place to work. Was a production job and was constantly moving. Needed to be alert and able to multitask at this job."
good,"Management changes not compatible with employees.  The new system involved rating jobs and making recommendations to increase job performance.  But these changes resulted in reduced maintenance per shift and increased duties which were impossible to achieve without help from non-qualified line workers. There was a constant change in management, therefore new rules.  I think they lost track of company objectives to achieve a greater ISO status."
good,Great pay and very understanding in the human resource office but the job will not advance you unless you know someone in a higher position that is not acceptable
good,a typical day at mohawak industries consist of loading unloading trailers using fork lift. mohawk is a fun place to work at because time goes by quick. very friendly environment.
good,"A typical day at work is and can be at least 50% physical but mostly mental I deal with at least 10 to 20 order tickets a day, deliveries all through the day, several phone calls dealing with customer service questions, tracking shipments, scheduling deliveries and many miscellaneous calls."
good,Worked 12hrs shift from 8pm-8am. I loved my job and the people are really friendly. They always give us things on holidays and always feed us every three months
good,"Good pay, but hard labor, not for everyone.  I learned a new appreciation for those of us who work in factories.  The environment is loud, and fast paced.  Management pushes production, and quality which sometimes does not happen to go hand in hand.  Hardest part of the job was working on weekends mandatory, and leaving my family."
good,"Harassment and favoritism happen on a regular basis! Good pay, but the union makes the work environment cliquey! Once you're out of your 90-days, it's hard to get fired! They use a bid-sheet way of promotion that can be unfair. You get promoted to higher-paying jobs  based on seniority rather than skill level, which really sucks if you're new there, because most people have been there 20+ years.  Overall, easy work for decent money, not always worth the high-school type atmosphere and ethical compromises..."
good,Need more leadership.  Needs more scheduling.  Needs better working conditions.  Overall they have treated me good but there are things that can be improved upon
good,I had an opportunity to work with different kinds of users and stakeholders and used many tools to collect the requirements.  There was lot to do about change management in requirements but had a good experience
good,a interactive work place with great co-workers typical day is peeling carpet logs I have learned at this job that constant work is best the hardest part is pushing thousand pound logs. the most enjoyable part is break time with co-works.
good,Mohawk is a good company to work for. They have good benefits for their employees. They have on-site clinics that employees can use if they are needed.
good,"I'm only filling out this part because it didn't give me any other options after hitting continue. I hate the feeling of no options. But now that I've reached the minimum, I'm out."
good,"I worked from 7p.m. to 7 a.m. The hours were long, but my co-workers and my manager were awesome and we all had fun together. They made working 12 hour shifts a whole lot more bearable."
good,unfair treatment of employees. very hot work place. no training for advancement. But I was at work everyday and did the best job I could do for them.
good,good for someone coming out of school learned how to run different machines  fast pace ok pay long hours ( 8 hours to 12 hours not including overtime )
good,my review on mohawk ind is they are big on safety which is a plus i enjoy working with mohawk ind started in 2006 alot of employees work together as a team.but i have noticed there is room for emprovement in the area of communcation.i feel each employee should be giving the fair chance as each other for what ever the case may be.
good,"Best name in the industry many customer will program their products especially in California."
good,Drives fork lift all day. Very little overtime. Pay is great and the supervisors are reasonable. Production standards are a little high
good,You was on your feet 12 hours at a time. Which was good for losing weight. But it was a very hard and physical job. You wasn't allowed to go outside at all to get fresh air. It's a job of labor.
good,Great Territory Managers to work with - hard working and dedicated to doing the best job possible - Mohawk has more tools to work with than any other soft surface manufacture
good,"Best part of job was how involving and detailed the position required me to be. Love being so challenged."
good,"Mohawk is good place to work if you don't mind hard labor. Shifts are 12 hours long you work swing shifts. "
good,"My day was always the same,lifting and loading heavy boxes on pallot jacks and stacking them on shelves."
good,"Production, quality "
good,This job is very physical but can be exhausting. Sometimes the job may not be in good shape when you come in but it's a good feeling working hard and making it look good before you leave. This job has taught me that regardless of how hard a job is that if you apply yourself it can still be rewarding.
good,The opportunities at the Torrington plant were plentiful which is what inspired me to accept the position. Developing a strong foundation was critical to developing the proper systems for the entire plant to achieve the goals.
good,"Threads and repairs breakouts to maintain machine efficiency and meet production standards Proactively identifies yarn quality during production runs Selects and stages tubes for winder operation Doffs off finished yarn packages as required Maintains daily production records (Ex. breakouts, roller lamps usage, tunnel stops)."
good,Day to day could vary based on projects that I may be going working on.
good,Mohawk was a great place to work in terms of the coworkers. Managers tended to have no appreciation for the skills and experiences of their team members however. People were promoted based on personal preference. Persons with invaluable experience and knowledge were often dismissed because they warranted a higher rate of pay; and then were replaced with some person with no skills or experience.
good,"Pay was good, employees were mostly enjoyable to work with. Upper management was difficult due to micromanagement. If that doesn't bother you then you should be fine."
good,"Pros:"
good,I'm very opening minded to learning more and to have growth with what ever company that I my have a chance working with I'm a team player also have training experience and also forklift ceterfied.the job environment is ok it's the work hours are not.
good,Had boxes and other materials are scattered throughout the warehouse. A lot of pointing fingers. Other than that management was perfect my supervisor treated all of us with respect.
good,"Pay is very good. Time off/ benefits not so great. Management is unorganized, things change minute to minute, day to day. Very slim advancement opportunity. Safety is only a priority if it doesn't interfere with getting the job done. Weekends off is a plus! Equipment is average. No sick days, or personal days at all!! Possibility of being laid off at any given moment is a reality."
good,"You do have benefits but the benefits but not great, insurance is not good and some departments have fiberglass particles floating through the air so they will be on you and you will breathe them also supervisors have very bad attitudes some will yell some will cuss at you"
good,Good company with many changes in management which caused working with new managers frequently and made an uncomfortable situation until people adjusted or left
good,"Mohawk is a great company to work at, but the state and location I work at we is poorly paid. The best thing about Mohawk is the insurance, Its very easy to move up."
good,"I Like the environment that I worked in. Break rooms were clean.I was a Machine Operator, so I made sure that every department had the correct equipment they needed"
good,We worked nearly 24/7 the pay was great but I never had a weekend off. With that said I am still flexible with time. They would not allow me to move on to full time and only kept me as a temp.
good,Benefits are great. Company is good. Not alot  of advancement. manager is good. There is no interaction. Not very appreciated. Pay is good. Understanding.
good,Many days I was unable to complete the quantity they were requiring me to complete on a daily basis. Did not seem to be able to remember all the different national company account and contract.
good,Could definitely improve in a lot of areas.  So i would rate it a 5 if I had to. A lot of favoritism is shown and the management is a little slack. The company would be better if they would let some of the employees that love their work place voice their opinions on how to make things run more smoothly.  Or what changes could be made to better the workplace.
good,Trabajar cuidadosament. Es 8n buen trabajo es una de las compañías más reconocidas a nivel estados unidos
good,"Great jobs, but management wanted you standing 11.5 hours out of 12. even though job did not require it. Would make employees drive to work to be sent back home instead of telling them before hand."
good,Depending on the department you will be working in basically. I started as an Extrusion Operator and was happy with my all around job envrionment but then transferred to go back to school and I felt like I began a new job wih a new company.
good,Good place to work  but needs improved upper management. Enjoy my co-workers. Enjoyed my job but need structure in the department.
good,It's a good place to work. The hardest part is having to be on your knees everyday.
good,The job isnt bad but organization is lacking as far as supply room. The best thing to do is mind your business and dont talk to anyone about anything personal or those backwoods folk will have it all over the plant.
good,Everyday is a new adventure at Mohawk. Mohawks provides plenty of opportunity for growth in various areas and departments.
good,Pay was excellent but felt more like a number than an employee.
good,Pay is good  howers long I world recommend you apply to mohawk  never know you might just love the place some others do it's a little  far for me to drive  but in time I'm sure  I can make a change  for my advantage
good,"I learned many skills like Weilding, electrical, and more. Pretty strick on safety. If you are in maintenance it tends to be either really slow or really busy depending on what breaks that day."
good,"It's an OK place to work if you don't mind hard work. Our plant is small only old junky twisters(I think our plant has the oldest of all the Mohawk plants) and heatset. Both of these jobs are hard work a lot of new hires don't make it because it's hard. If you make it through training and hang in there it's an OK place. Pay is good, 2nd and 3rd shift supervisors are OK to work for can't say the same about first shift as far as the supervisor goes."
good,normally a stressful day.learned how what hard work was working there on certain day's.management was great.the hardest part was we was trying to run 2 ply yarn.it made the machine extremely hard to run.
good,"Uncertain hours, sporadic weekly layoffs some weeks, then 7 days a week other weeks, uncertain of work schedule until Thursday of work week, disorganized middle management, no follow through on discipline. Very safety conscious, recycle program, okay benefits, shopping discounts, discounted product line"
good,"Long hrs,hard to balance family life.Very easy place to work and got along with other employees fine.Company has a lot of benefits to offer.Over time hours are always offered."
good,A great place to work if you're looking for advancement. The paid time off is great and teamwork exceptional. Rules change frequently so you always have to be on your toes.
good,Mohawk Industries is a great place to work.  The trouble was that there was a communication gap between most sites.  The hardest part of my job was staying challenged and learning at the same time.  The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable.
good,"I worked over 5 years with Mohawk industries and made over 45,000 year I worked around good people every day was a pleasant experience. The management area.liked alto to be desired for advancement was impossible"
good,This job was alright. There was a high turn over of personnel when I was there.  It was not the cleanest environment (though I know there are jobs that would be worse). It also did not fit in with my schooling I had finished. Did not feel it would be something for me to do the rest of my work days either.
good,Machines are too close together and job assignments are too much for the run ability of the yarn. Poorly set up and though out.  No time to even think about quality.
good,Enjoyed working with textile's. The company made me feel like part of the family. The management was good to work with. On hot weather days they provided cold water or Gatorade to all employees. They give hams and turkeys for holidays. Employees were given dinners for quarterly safety.
good,"Overall productive experience, expanded my experience and knowledge of various Customs programs, procedures, software packages.  Typical day included managing day to day import/export operations, updating management in changing regulations, manage workflow and personnel and anticipate any potential impact to supply change.  Workplace culture generally pleasant but days could also be quite stressful.  Hardest part was managing ever increasing workload while ensuring high level of customer service.  Most enjoyable part of work was interacting with various departments within organization."
good,Mohawk is a great place to work if you do not have children or a family. 12 hours day or night. Mandatory overtime and no schedule breaks of any kind.
good,was a fast paced job with large range of diversity. Management was a little bad due to turning the other way on a lot of things that were being done and had to take things to front office to get it resolved. hardest part of job was keeping machines going for a specific amount of time and keeping track of injuries through sections. not to mention finding replacements when people didnt show up. most enjoyed aspect was learning the human resource role and the management role as well.
good,I liked working at Mohawk it was a  pretty good job until we had to change shifts the pay was good and the management was good the hardest part about the job was hand bagging the rugs.
good,clock in and get busy so you can get done early is usually what i go for  especially since its 12 hrs then i go home sleep and by the time i wake up and do it again
good,Well run company.  Buy the stock.  But expect to work long hours. This is a place where people get there early and stay late.  Nice offices in Calhoun.  Huge array of products to sell - widest in the industry.
good,"i work full time for Mohawk, the pay is great the hours we get are great but sometimes i think we over work. the work is very durable and i like the company its just the drive i have to take is a hassle."
good,"High stress, fast-passed environment. Good pay compensates the work environment. Keep up with production highly here, but if you stay busy production is reasonable."
good,Not enough time spent with the company to offer a lot of value. The people I worked with were great managers. Productive learning environment.
good,"work is usually busy. the people here are very friendly and sweet."
good,"Days flew by felt great when I got home looked forward to going back to work the next day. It was a real busy place the boss was cool I don't think he is there anymore. I struggled in the beginning but once I got the hang of it through my training I became a pro,"
good,A typical day at work for me is trying to make sure that the best carpet goes out the door everyday. The management does not listen to reasoning when someone explains to them that the carpet is not good to get shipped but they let it go anyways. It's about production and not quality and I am about quality. My co-workers are hard to work with because they do not listen when I explain to them to throw out certain things and they get confused because they don't know how to pack the carpet correctly. The hardest part of my job is explaining what needs to be done to have great quality but it gets looked over because they care about production. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that once a month I get 5 days off. I have learned how to make sure that I do my job correctly even though no one else wants too.
good,"Job consisted entirely of making judgement calls on the quality of carpet tiles as they came off the line. I felt like it was kind of pointless alot of the time when orders that I held for quality reasons like defects were shipped anyway often solely based on urgency and size rather than giving the customer a quality product. The guidelines for what is acceptable constantly change and since I work an off shift (nights), I receive little to no instruction that a change has been made."
good,"It is a very pleasant place to work, work pressure is used but never toxic, I would love to continue working there but I have to move from place. It is a company that watches over the safety of its employees."
good,The thing with the they want u to run more then 1 machine for 12 hours and with the pay one week ugly worked 36 hours and another week u work 48 hours
good,"Loved my job and co-workers. Worked 7-3 five days a week."
good,I liked it but had to look for another job because I was working through a temp agency and never got hired. My coworkers and supervisors were really nice.
good,A product and fun work place.to work I really appreciated the time i was there and am trying to go back . I love to  retire from Mohawk and received the benefits from it .I enjoyed it and am ready to come back anytime I can also referr Mohawk to a friend or family member.
good,I work there for 6 years along with my dad and it was a good thing that i got work along side my dad and made me a hard worker and person to everybody
good,Recruiting for the local suuroundings is HORRIBLE. Shaw pays way more than Mohawk. After you get pass the recruiter..everything else seems to flow. The recruiters just don't communicate enought between one another. You get short breaks..supervisors are ok for now.
good,"There's not much room for advancement. "
good,Mohawk Sample department was a great place to work with excellent management!!
good,Overall good place to work lots of hours. the management is not the best and lots of accidents. Tired of working night shift. Lays off alot and the turn over rate is bad
good,"Job security is excellent. However it's a more of ""who you know"" in order to advance. Jobs are offered by seniority not by performance. Plus side is that it's only an 8 hour shift. Some overtime is required."
good,"has it ups and downs..most days, good.."
good,Mohawk was a great place to work but the people were often very gossipy and knew too much innappropriate information about their coworkers. The Mohawk facilities were also in the middle of nowhere but if you don't mind solitude then you will have no problem.
good,"Job is easy, I enjoyed working there, management was great, safe place to work, excellent pay and insurance, great holiday pay and most of all had weekends off."
good,The normal day here is going in for 12 hours while the supervisor is standing where you need to go or telling you to do one thing and then coming over and telling you not to do that but to do something else
good,"Management was fun and understanding.Downfall was I worked long hours with little compensation. Overall, this was a great first job out of college."
good,"Typical work day is 10+ hours 5 days a week and some Saturdays."
good,u go in were the tuffing machine has run for 16 hr and u have to catch the creel up by your self.the heat is very bad  leader person need to check creel which they dont
good,i creeled and maintanece i enjoy hard work and fullfilling my job
good,"Suitable for a person who can handle stress incoming emails of 80+ daily.  Needs have more structure. Pay is good, but not enough for the stress. Supervisor not very reliable needs to invest on training more."
good,Very demanding. Little to no training. Must definitely be self driven to succeed. Management can work on communication and support. Workload is stressful at times which causes overtime with weeks of 50+ hours (includes working from home)
good,I was discriminated on by co-workers daily. The whole company is not like this. My mother has worked there for many years and has had no problem. I guess it's the difference between office and warehouse.
good,Good money I worked 11-7 creeling (wears down your body and needs better AC) I was also a tufting machine operator good money but most managers were more worried about quantity not quality.
good,"Typical day would be getting to work around 5 to get a good parking spot, getting on the bus before 6 to get a seat, starting work around 7 depending on your foreman it goes as smooth as possible from there. wrap up around 435 wait for the bus to leave at 445 deal with traffic"
good,"Worked 8 hour shift for 10 years. Pay and benefits were good, but job closed."
good,Productive work place good lace to work freindly atmoshere
good,"Decent but a great place to work "
good,I really enjoyed my job the only thing is they let me go 1 week away from my 90 days being up even though i had a doctors note saying that i coudnt work.
good,"Experienced Warehouse Coordinator with demonstrated history of working in the textiles industry.Skilled in Manufacturing, Customer Service, Inventory Management, Team Building, and Forklift Operations.I am a very good team member willing to learn new things and help my co-workers."
good,"Mohawk is an incredible company with lots going on.  Normally an individual can move throughout the company to gain knowledge and experience.  Even with bad low level mgt opportunities can be obtained. Mohawk lays off twice a year.  These layoffs keep the workforce in constant rotation.  Lots of long term information lost.  Lots of departmental training year round due to layoffs and new associate training after the layoffs.  Constant rotation of personnel in the operations side of things. Many corporate positions leaving US.  Opportunities for training personnel in other countries now.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping other people get up to speed and helping other locations learn what the 'new' management has mandated.  In a 2 year period have had 7 managers.  Each management change has initiated all new procedures and job duties.  Many of the new management do not perform adequate due diligence to learn current processes or systems prior to making rash changes.  Impacts of ill-planned, rash management can mean months of systems clean up or even weeks of additional re-creation for data lost (or deleted) from the system.  A mentoring program for new management in high turnover areas would be an opportunity Mohawk could explore."
good,to many people who want to lead but dont know anything about the job we do. We need better leadership. People who are willing to learn the job befor they tell how to do your job
good,A 12 hours a day begin with 30 minute. After the meeting we get our job assignment. I begin my day with looking over my job making sure there no breakout in the yards.
good,"The layoff was devastating for so many.  "
good,"The BEST part of my position with Mohawk was before they bought another company with their established sales people and began territory realignments . AND went into a ""team selling"" approach . This was based on trust of each other & it became extremely ""cut throat"" to one another . The new leaders slowly began changing individual accounts to their stars & when my sales showed declines I was terminated . They began a systematical approach to rid themselves of prior established ""Mohawk"" sales reps including the top 3 regions (myself included) that annually produced over $11 million in sales ...just in one product line . It ended up with me competing against my own teammates which made no sense ."
good,OK place to work if the would care about there employes more management do not even know how to do the jobs there expecting everyone else to do
good,I really enjoyed my time and experience and learning something new it was a very important task to learn how to load and unload them trucks efficiently & safely.
good,The only problem I have with my curent job i's they are closing the mill.I need a full time job and they are going to close the doors where I am currently at.
good,"People were great to work with, spent many years improving efficiency and production. A typical day, was going out to find select machines that were lacking production."
good,"Mohawk gave me a great opportunity for advancement, travel and team building support. Encouraged and trained us to be good business partners with all business partners."
good,"Very hot in the summer, very cold in the winter.  Stresses SAFETY.  Enjoyed the first 3 yrs of my 4 yrs there.  No shift differential, No sick time, 12 hr and 15 min days..  48 hrs 1 week, 36 next.  Work every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday."
good,I started as part time working in the afternoons its not an easy balance when you have kids.I loved the Job its self but had to leave because the hours.
good,"Typical day was busy and I learned many things such as team work and patience. Management was okay, it was hard to approach them. The hardest part was the heat."
good,good pay but it is constant continuous work for 12 hrs a shift. decent benefits. its a fast pace environment.with minimum advancement. but overall an OK place to work
good,"Of course when I started working there was in the 90's & things have changed immensely but, all in all a great place to work , I worked at the Aladdin building & Eton Extrusion  both enjoyed everyone I worked w/ & the guidance & experience I received."
good,Its a good job but advancement is hard. The pay is good and management isn't unpleasant. The work atmosphere is hot and loud but most of the employees are easy going and good natured.
good,Assembly line production work with quotas that had to be maintained. The manufacturing of carpet from a single strand to a completed 12 foot roll was very arduous and fast paced
good,"Typical Carpet Mill environment"
good,"I need to be challenged. Day to day work is very repetitive. No new challenges or rewards. No place for growth. Management team works well with you however, they do not push you to grow and advance."
good,"Worked 12hr shifts, While keeping a winder running. I really liked 12hr shifts compared to 8hr shifts"
good,"Easy job, do the same thing over and over so its gets easy. Management isn't harsh on you. Good hours."
good,"Working at Mohawk I ndustries.I learned more about manufacturing how to twist yarns for carpet  ,how to inspect labels for correct identification..We were rewarded  for our safe acts in many different ways"
good,I enjoyed when I was there. Good pay. Hours were kinda long but got use to it. Fast pace you did have to be in shape a little bit. Just keep up and do your work and you'll be ok.
good,Mohawk was a decent place to work. For the job the pay was fair. They try to make it a good place to work for everyone. They also do activities throughout the year to get involved with safety.
good,Great people working this establishment- LEAN environment. Really enjoyed my roll and working for my manager before my department shut down years ago.
good,"There are quite a few really good people to work with.  However, upper management seems to be stuck in the 50's management style.  Rule with an iron fist.  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to work anymore."
good,"Mohawk is interested in results only, not the success of their people.  They did provide structured training events as well as excellent compensation for managnement"
good,"Pros -"
good,when i started at mohawk at 18 i really loved my job learned alot the work place was great the hardest part of my job at the time was 12 hours the most enjoyable was the people
good,This Company is large and offers many was to advance. If you have skills and or education they will put them to the test. Very challenging and rewarding.
good,Oversee functions of warehouse workers on an assigned shift to ensure accuracy and completeness of warehouse responsibilities and on-time shipping 
good,It's ok for someone that actually enjoys working inside. The job just wasn't for me. I felt like u was in a prison all the time because there were no windows. I like being outdoors.
good,Buenaa conductas buen ambiente buenas ideas seguridad al trabajador y sobre todo buen comportamiento entre jefes y trabajadores
good,"Worked alone, good pay, great shift, interesting on the job training and experience.   Worse part of job was overfilled silo but still enjoyed my job."
good,"very easy place to work and got along with other employees great. The life work balance was ok. I mean do you really want to work all the time. I was sent to college for Supervisory Development, however when completed I never got a job off the floor."
good,"Good place to work but hard to move up in company."
good,Foam rubber rolls made inside the plant to make carpet padding. The foam was threaded into a machine to make carpet padding to be loaded onto a truck. We loaded the semi-trailers by hand. Clamp trucks.
good,CTS Chennai : Worked for Mohawk Industries  : Nice Opportunity to Learn
good,Mohawk is a good company to work for but at this time there going through a transformation period and employment isn't very secured. There laying off employee thats worked for them over 35yrs. with the only options being is to take a lay-off or take another position with less pay.
good,"Good company but there is large disconnect between upper management and the people on the ground. Lot of cronyism, decent amount of independence but they like reports. Overall good company"
good,A great place to work.  Good customer service. The management is a understanding and willing to help. The food  was good. The service is friendly and willing to help the customer.
good,This place was the worst I have ever worked out. The place stayed very hot with no air conditioning.. 12 hours shifts are for nobody. The work was hard.
good,I honestly like this job. I wish I could have kept it but due to an unfortunate chain of events including family emergencies & my wife giving birth prematurely I was un able to.
good,Great work place and innovation. Multi facet company with many products to present. Flexible scheduling and great benefits.
good,Mohawk is a decent company to work for.  You learn a great deal as the enterprise is very large and support is needed for divisions of the company.
good,"Fast paced, challenging but rewarding. Continuously changing and challenging regulatory environment. Always on the leading edge of product development and industry changes."
good,The management for the most part is not good. They do not have a set time to go in or to leave. It's hard to plan things outside of work when you do not know when you are going to go in or get out.
good,"Traveled new york to sell carpet products and prmote any new products, sell advertsing and ads. "
good,I review workers compensation claims and get them determined to be compensable or not. If employee goings out of work due to injury I work to get them released and back to work. If a claim goes into litigation I then work closely with Defense Attorney to prepare for any upcoming hearing or Litigation issues
good,An excellent experience to grow my skills and develop new areas of expertise.  Worked in multiple roles within the company to develop a wide array of new skills.
good,"My day was spent in a cubicle. If you can handle that this job is for you. The hours where a little tough for me, because I have a small child and no daycare stays open till 9. The pay is great for sitting on your bum and taking phone calls all day. The customers , overall, are mostly friendly. You get a few complainers, but that is customer service for you. Mohawk is always changing. If you like change and can roll with the punches GOOD, but I do NOT recommend this job for someone who is stuck in their ways and does not like change. They change the rules daily. Definitely, too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Best advice, do your job, make your paycheck, take your weekends off , and be done with it."
good,The hardest part of the job is the drive to and from work. It takes me an hour or so to get to the plant that I cover. Then I drive again to my office in Dalton GA and once my work day is over I drive back to my home in TN which takes about 45 minutes. I am thankful that Mohawk does pay for mileage. Co-Workers are nice and great to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my co workers and my responsibilities. I was able to grow with the company, however, I was laid off."
good,"Worked in Photoshop daily, making custom roomscenes and custom carpet patterns.  Uploaded products to company website as well as dealing with customer service call with sales reps. and other designers."
good,"The job itself was wonderful, but upper management could not decide how to proceed. There was a lot of conflict in exactly what we were supposed to be doing. There were a couple of bad decisions made by higher ups and the whole company paid for it. But overall, I still enjoyed working there."
good,"A normal day at work may include startup machines, monitor operation and make adjustments as needed, perform safety inspections and re-work orders and processing charts. Also spinner and twister operator. I learned how to work safely, communicate with co-workers, and work as a team. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was load or unload material or workplace into machonery. The most enjoyable part of the job was friendly people, good benefits. Easy to talk to supervisors."
good,Worked for this company for almost 30 years. Had new boss come In and put up some new poles around In the plant. So I hit one of the poles twice.And they sent me home went back 3months later to a new job and was told to go home cause I couldn't do the Job. The Job was In the spinning department. They was suppose to give me 8 weeks In training but only got three weeks. So they told me to come back the next day and I went back to take a sweeping Job . This Job was going to be a three dollar an hour cut In pay .But I was going to take It anyway. Then they told me things had changed and they said to just let me go. Everyone one else that Is doing the Job now Is hitting the poles. One Lady hit It and a person but she Is still there?. I put In a lot of years at that plant and never stayed out worked every time was ask to do over time.
good,Great job/ Pay was ok and the company gave you a lot of tools to help the customer want to buy from you.
good,I enjoyed working there. The only reason why i left was to move closer to home.
good,Very quick paced production work. Can’t let your line get behind. The shift worked were where you got 5 days off every other week but you also had to work 12 hours a day.
good,Even though they pay the best I had bad luck with horrible management and to top it off HR knew about it and never did anything about stuff. This was virgil dr and tapistron
good,"Mohawk was an alright place to work. It was hot, but it's a flooring mill it's hot in there. The pay was great for cost of living. Benefits were good."
good,"Orders slowing down and coming in causing shifts to continuosly change causing layoffs and uncertainty about if we will get to keep our jobs or not. I love working for this company, I just dont know what the future holds."
good,"Good pay, benefits, but very stressful.  Healthy life center is great.  HR structure is not like I am used to.  A lot moving around  Understand that is typical."
good,"The hours are very very long, and your feet and back will hurt from standing for 10 hours, but its decent money. If you stick around, you'll get your benefits but it takes awhile. Its very safety oriented."
good,Mohawk is a productive place to work with a lot fun and celebration if we achieved our goals. The pay is not too shabby. The benefits are not bad. The right manager will allow flexible hours. I can recommend this company as a great place to work.
good,"Mohawk is a good place to work, but you work long hours.  It is a fast paced environment and every day is a new challenge.  I cover a lot of territories and like the people i interact with."
good,It was very competitive and very easy to get fired. they made it clear ANYONE is replaceable. The job paid well but you didn't have the extras such as sick days etc.
good,Not a bad place to work. Very competitive and cut throat at times. Great benefits and good people to work around. It's a up and down environment as far as work consistently
good,Mohawk Ind.  was an ok place to work for.  Ok benefits and vacation.  Other than cutbacks often it would be an ok work place.  Normal play for the area.
good,It was a great job just understaffed and the supervisors did not care about there employees. I enjoyed going to work everyday just wish I could've worked a different shift.
good,It was real work constantly for 12 hours where you had to have your mind set right to maintain your production which to me that's how you should approach every job
good,"even thorough I was not there very long I did learn a lot about the companies and employees inaction with each other. The company did not want to tell the employees that they were closing down their shop. The employees already known, but they never let it effect their quality of work."
good,"Typical work day: Intense."
good,results driven with bottom line focus.  High salaries are targeted for elimination.  Company lacks software tools commonly used in transportation industry making some jobs very challenging.
good,The employees don't get paid enough for what they do there. The job is very rewarding and I would still be there had the company paid us more for all we had to do.
good,"Ok place to work. Management is supportive most of the time. A big company which is still expanding, multi-billion dollar company. I never knew how much went in to make carpet until I worked here. Its just not the type of work I would like to continue doing."
good,"From the moment you join the Lincoln Financial team, you will feel a sense of optimism about what your team is going to achieve, and will be motivated to goto work every day. The employees are confident in their future — and share that confidence with our clients."
good,"During my time with Mohawk Industries, the business seemed to be in a constant state of growth. Several acquisitions along the way kept life very exciting and at times quite challenging. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"I worked with the Home Depot stores everyday on any problems they were having on backorder, pricing, claims or compensation.  I was their key contact person."
good,i liked to work there great team it was hard work but ok i didnt mind
good,"i have worked in shipping for over 30 years and my skills i had when i went to work for mohawk helped me get the shipping coordinator job i had there"
good,"I talk to many people every day.  You have to be a very good people "
good,"operate two machine spinning yarn on bobbins. I learned how to operate the machine better, so the yarn wouldn't lap up. Management was good. If you got a good partner that well you had a good team. When we had bad yarn, it would lab up bad on both machines. We walk all day, we got good exercise. "
good,Found out what I needed to do and then inspect the forklift and then got to work in a safe environment also had a lot of safety regulations that made work interesting
good,They have long work schedules 12 hours shifts Monday through Friday. Work environment have to be use to Work in any weather conditions. Have to be a team player. Supervisors are a little bossy and head strung.
good,Good place to work but you will hard hard for the money they pay you. No sitting down what so ever! Unless your on break. Just work and stay to yourself
good,I was out of memphis tn  where the racism is terrible. Job made easy people do work together.  Employes bashing of supervisor for things not in the persons control.
good,"Great company to work for, amazing team of co workers! Great pay with really good hours, laid back job with alot of perks , I would love to work for a company like mohawk any day"
good,They are good to work for. They treat their employees pretty well. They are very family oriented and understand that family has to come first. They benefits aren’t that great though.
good,"Enjoyed working at Mohawk, just be prepared for perfection with your job performance because they will expect it at all times! Pay is good and management is friendly"
good,"Its a company with a lot of opportunity, work , A variety  of diversity culture, people they are such nice, safety rules are important for this industries"
good,The work was very physical but not hard. As long as you stayed on top of your job your shifts went by pretty fast. The 12 hour shifts with 2 on 2 off every other weekend was nice. The only thing i can say bad is they should give back more to their team and take care of their people and they should balance their work load out to keep their people working all 52 weeks a year.
good,"Warehouse work is usually up and down depending on what season, company is supplier for Lowes,Home Depot, and every other building contractor with flooring needs."
good,Good pay and human Resources works with any issues that arrive.  They have programs that help those in need and does alot to save employees job. Hard work though.
good,"Not w bad place to work. It's just the people who bring their problems from home to work. Other than that, Mohawk industries division in Danville va is a great place to work"
good,"A decent company overall to work for. Good pay and benefits. Unfortunately, as with many companies, there's a lot of favoritism that goes on with management but that may have just been an issue at my particular location."
good,"It's a great creative place to learn how a massive company runs and keeps you on your feet. Departments are hardworking and the all around culture is relaxed."

good,"I worked for mohawk for several years and overall had a good experience. My plant was closed in May of 2017 and they were a class act during this difficult time. They provided costly health insurance but it was better than none(family deductible was over $3,000). They did provide a health savings account that the company somewhat contributed to."
good,Me personally did not like Mohawk that much because im used to being outside all the time and inside the factory I just didn't feel like myself. People link had me a utility which means I do whatever they tell me to not one steady job and that doesn't seem fair in my opinion.
good,Lots of overtime good people to work with good pay management is ok not much chance of advancement overall it pays the bills always short handed good place to work
good,"Room to advance in almost every starting position.  Corporate demands can be stressful at times and require extra hours including holidays, especially for salaried positions."
good,The people I worked with were good people! I like all of them. they worked hard!  I learned that being a supervisor at Mohawk was a hard job. mostly made hard by upper management! wanted me to run with less people and still get production! Not having the people I needed made it hard! The best thing about the job was the people! Real good hard working people!

good,Ok place to work health benefits are not so good but the pay is great. You really have to know the right people to move up in this company.
good,I love the job i do .It keeps me in shape.My co-workersare great and we work as a team.The management is alright.The hardest part of the job is getting started;the rest isa piece of cake!
good,This was a great job  but when they shut a shift down I took the lay off to continue my education
good,I provided 14 hours a day to accomplished job requirements and excellent accomplishment.
good,"Company encourages leading edge HR programs and provides various support functions for HR, Compensation and Benefits team."
good,"Very hard work"
good,mohawk is great place to work good pay good people to work for
good,"Management for the most part is ok to work for, the benefits are decent but pricey, the hours depending on the department are great during the summer but the winters are slow, and the pay is pretty good. The place is a drama mill of nothing but gossip"
good,To keep workers supplied with needed materials to complete production at all times.
good,"The company is organized and fair. My co-workers are team players. Hard part of the job is time management. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the end product,"
good,"Productive, learned to operate and fixed machines when they broke down. Co-workers were nice we helped each other out alot. "
good,Typical atmosphere of a Fortune 500 company. Natural growth procession that can be achieved. Excellent opportunities to further education and learn new skills.
good,"Training new hire employees for Customer Services in a 6 week training program with included: Learning the AS400 computer system, product knowledge of 7 different flooring products with accessories, and soft skill communication classes. Also updated material, as needed, to help support the Customer Service Team. Presented enhancement and refresher classes as needed for on-going training. Maintained a good relationship with the Customer Service Supervisors to help give one-on-one training as needed for the Customer Service agents. Keeping a postive, upbeat, and energetic attitude in an enviroment that is so stressful caused by management was very challenging. But by helping/coaching someone to overcome their issue or their challenge was very rewarding."
good,Over all Mohawk industres is a great place to work. If still in GA I would be working for Mohawk. Unfortunately the economy effect this company and they had to down size.
good,"Have to be able to stand on feet for long periods at a time, hands in job. I inspected all the carpets as it came off the rolling machine to see if there was any tips or tears in them and then if I saw some would have to fix them"
good,"Hours and pay are good"
good,"Management cares more about production than the fact that they are over working their employees"
good,"Good company to get experience with."

good,"Unfortunately due to organizational changes, roles in North Carolina have been shifted to Calhoun, GA.  Should a person seeking a job in that area I would suggest applying on the Mohawk website."
good,"Mohawk offers decent pay but upper management can be hard to work with at times. Enjoyed working for immediate boss and grew territory by a million dollars.I never got decent coverage when on vacation, so I always worked. Company is massive so there is always room to grow and move around different sectors."
good,"Delivered flooring supplies to businesses and customers. It was hard work, but it made the days go by fast. Lots of work until the housing crash and then it got real slow."
good,"This is specific to the print plant, which is actually one of Mohawk's smaller and lower paying plants, so it may not be fair to the company overall. But my pay was still decent because I was one of the highest paid operators in the building. The crew leader's are good, the management is fair-minded and pretty good. Even when work was busy we at least got holidays off, but they do need you to put in the overtime when they need you. They will use temp services for jobs that will go away and there is a good job security. Even starting as a temp service worker you can work your way into a full-time position, usually."
good,I didn't mind the nightshift. The only downfall was the room for advancement. And I was ever made an offer to be given a promotion. Salary wasn't the best.
good,"The job was great pay and benefits. Long hours, you'd work 12 hours and have enough time to go home, eat, sleep, and do it all over again. Some managers were good, but most were awful. Upper management cares absolutely nothing about their employees, you're just a body to them. No sick time and they work on a point system. They'd rather have you in there with the flu than at home actually getting better, even if the doctor says you should be out. A doctors note means nothing to them, no matter whether it's a cold or serious injury.  You can work your points down but it takes working an extra four 12 hour days to make up for the one day you were out and that's only if they can find extra work for you to do."
good,I was in charge of over 800 million in assets as the manager of Corporate Loss Prevention. My job including protecting the safety of the employee's as well as the assets of the company.
good,"Mohawk is a top rated company and deserve this rating.  Mohawk has an excellent team of sales staff and I have enjoyed working with my fellow co workers.  I would like to have transferred with Mohawk, however there were no openings in the Colorado Springs/Pueblo area"
good,Great place to learn and grow with a growing company. Good management team with much experience in the industry. Plenty of helpful tools for individual growth. Fast paced environment with safety as the main focus and discussed daily. Good atmosphere.
good,"Excellent company to work for in regard to pay, benefits and work environment.  I was given the tools I needed to do my job with regards to equipment, software, access, and freedom to make decisions. However, the training was haphazard and unorganized. Once I took over my position there were many responsibilities that had never been mentioned in training.  "
good,"People. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much money you make, your hours, etc. What matters is the people you have on your team or in your group, that make coming to work fun. Mohawk is just like that - a family type environment. "
good,The managers are a pleasure to work with and they stand behind their employees.  As a logistics analyst/customer service associate it is very enjoyable to know that I have a part in making sure that freight is shipped by assigning freight and placing it on a shipment for the warehouse to complete and forward to the customer in a timely and effective manner.
good,I worked a 12 hour shift. Working at Mohawk was challenging. Hard work from beginning to ending.The hardest part of the job was working behind someone who would make your job harder. Lack of team work. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a job and I did what was needed to keep that job.
good,"Good, steady work with profitable accounts.  Moved up from warehouse employee to warehouse manager and finally to terminal manager for the Orlando office.  Co-workers are now friends that have become like family.  Fast paced environment but also enjoyable."
good,the company treated me fair the entire time I was working there.
good,Solid Fortune 500 company.  Good benefits. Seeking a company with this size to dial in my B2B expertise.
good,"This job was a call center environment.  Naturally, your job consisted of the same thing every day.  If you can handle that, it is a great job.  The benefits from this company are wonderful and there are some wonderful managers locally.  "
good,"I cleaned and changed filters on chip blowing system, changed blades in bottle chippers, troubleshoot ,fix, service, and maintain plant machinery. Do up keep on building an facilities,make and print work orders, fill lp tanks, and clean grinder rooms. I learned that doing your job correctly is important even if others you work with dont. I enjoyed working with most of my fellow maintenance employees and i had a good supervisor that cared about his guys. The hardest part of my job was having to do my job and most of my lead mans because he didnt know what he was doing. The most enjoyable part was getting four days off one week and two the next."
good,Working on the coater was fun. I enjoyed the time spent there. I was able to work a lot of hours and on different shifts. Had plenty of opportunities to cross-train on different positions.
good,Great place to work ! Somewhat hectic but other than than .great pay for the area .expanding more and more everyday.thus creating more job openings .I would recommend this job

good,I like the company they have good benefits and on site clinics.  My coworkers are great they helped me when I started working for the company 2 years ago.
good,"Excellent place to work, the biggest problem with the place is the leads. Most of them get where they are due to seniority, even if they are terrible to people, or lazy, or just plain bad at being a leader. I've seen people there for 2 months do better work than someone that has been there 2 years and get picked based on seniority when the person with 2 months experience was clearly a better choice. I think rewards and advancement should go based on merit, not seniority. Every thing else they offer tho definitely makes up for the poor management. It's a great work atmosphere!"
good,"Dispatcher tells us where to go to pick up trailers.  "
good,"It was actually better than I had expected it to be, company advancement wasnt optional, due to it being a temporary employment. Although it was a warehouse, the people there really made it a more welcoming experience."
good,Mohawks is a great place to work at. You can move up quick but you have to be willing to put in the work. Hard work gets recognized. Training is available thru the employee central program.
good,"Mohawk Industries is an American flooring manufacturer based in Calhoun, Georgia, United States. Mohawk produces floor covering products for residential and commercial applications in North America and residential applications in Europe."
good,I liked working for mohawk  but was stressful running two machines. sometimes would have to run a machine two machines away from other machine I was running. Good pay   but  usually just 36 hrs a week. Moved to different job because can get all the overtime I want when I need to.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to build/enhance relationships as the means to obtain marketshare.  With the support of a national company providing state of the art products, there were many promising things to promote."
good,It was a good job. The Holden plant was closed in April of 2017. There were many challenges. Everyone worked together. We always had most week ends off.
good,"Company narrowed down going . But this company, had a family atmosphere. Great safety, everybody looked after each other. Was very hurt when let go. I felt like I Lopping my arm when I left.That business, the plant I worked at the plant in Eton, Georgia. Still miss it."

good,My typical day is normal.  I work eight hours shift. I learned to work in team and customer service. Safety is number one in my organization. Each employee must follow safety rules regardless of your area.
good,This company has been great to me over the years. The employees and management are respectable people at any plant i have worked for. The one thing that got to me was the mandatory overtime. It become 7 days 12 hour shifts for 6 monmonths at a time which affected my personal life . took on to many orders then what they could handle wich affected the employees
good,"Nice place to work , friendly coworkers but pay rate could be more. I would recommend the job for anyone seeking work . some of their rules are too stricted but not so much that you can't deal with ."

good,Mohawk Industries provides an exceptional training program for its new employees and continue it throughout employment.  The Supervisors promote a positive work environment even during difficult interactions with unhappy clients.
good,Mohawk Industries runs a tight ship but allows you the freedom to allow your personality to come through. I was trained initially and continued to receive training as processes changed or new items were added. I would certainly recommend working for Mohawk to anyone that asked me.

good,A typical day in Mohawk's Design department starts with an assessment of existing custom design jobs to determine the jobs priority that day.

good,Mohawk clearly defines your job and does a great job at assuring everyone works safely. There is opportunity for advancement if you are willing to earn it. The payrate is very flattering and their health insurance is fantastic.

good,"Mohawk Industries has been a very good experience for me so far. I have worked here for almost 10 months now. I currently work a 3am to 11am Monday thru Friday schedule. I have learned many new things and one of the biggest has been the introduction to AS400. Each work day is never the same. I start by checking emails and taking notes of anything specific a customer or my manager has sent me the day before. Next I begin unloading trailers from our mill in Georgia, along with two other warehouse employees I oversee. After unloading has finished, I am in charge of routing the product that has been received and loading it out along with my coworkers. This is when time management and delegating plays a big roll because we are on a time restraint for getting the loads completed. The route drivers can not afford to leave the facility late because customers are expecting their orders on time. After all the paperwork has been completed and load outs are done we continue our day doing a number of things. These responsibilities include but not limited to; cleaning the warehouse, inventory, helping will call customers and answering phone calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the reports and delaing with customers. I am constantly learning more and more with our computer system. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the physical portion of the job. Multiple times a week we have 300 rolls of pad on a trailer that is hand unloaded. I also love the lead aspect of the job. I have always had the urge to lead and help others, whether it was in sports or a simple group project"
good,"I worked in Design Studio with some incredible individuals. The atmosphere was one of creativity and encouragement. Our studio was managed by a enigmatic man who challenged us daily to expand our creative thoughts and encouraged us to seek help from one another. I truly enjoyed working with this team and the camaraderie we shared was a special experience. As far as what I found to be the most difficult, I would have to say, was in product development of new carpet collections. Launching new product always had a deadline and by the time it came to my part of this launching process, my time-frame was sometimes squeezed into a small window of time. but I always did what it took to get it done."
good,My job there was a special project job. And when the project ended so did my job. All in all the people and thr experience was amazing. I made a lot of great friends.
good,We stayed busy. But it made the time go by fast. The reason I left was because of the hours. I worked 11-8 and got offered a job that I could work 8-5. I couldn't turn that down. Mohawk had great benefits
good,"Working at Mohawk was hard work, but I was paid well for the work that I did and had health and life insurance. Mohawk Ind. was strict with safety and they taught us many things that kept me safe and out of harms way. I went through quiet a few supervisors but most were satisfied as long as I was doing my job correctly. The hardest part of the job was the heat which was uncomfortable but not unbearable. I enjoyed when the supervisor posted how well we ran. It felt somewhat like competition which made me want to work harder."
good,It was a positive workplace and the pay was very good. I think that they had the best benefits. Some friendly people and great work activities. But hard work.
good,Mohawk rewards their employees frequently. They have a fast paced business and expect you to be there and do your job. They have very strict expectations.
good,"I started out as a temp agency employee, as a pole lift driver. This is not a difficult job to learn and I honestly wouldn't mind doing it again. The pay is VERY competitive with other carpet companies. Within 2 years, I moved up to the position of Shipping Clerk and from there, to Load Expediter within 4 years, which is the 2nd highest paid hourly position. Back then, the position paid $11.98/hr but now, starting pay for a pole lift driver is over $16.00/hr."

good,My experience at Mohawk Industries was excellent. I learned different things about the machinery and new ideas to help produce quality work. The hardest part of the job was learning how to pace myself with the job I was trained to do and figure out how to do the job effectively. The management was good. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the co-workers teamed up to help others that may get behind on their work.

Then assist in using a stinger forklift to put heavy carpet rolls into warehouse, scanning barcodes with infra red scanners."

good,"Mohawk is a very professional yet fun atmosphere for growth and knowledge. Although being a very large corporation my experience has been that it is very family oriented or maybe thats the relationships I've built with colleagues.  I've progressed over the years from a desktop support technician to a systems analyst II...Management is very encouraging and for the roles they are in they are always striving for their team to do better, they encourage you to take training and will provide training...All the ones I have worked for or have been under have an open door policy, even the directors.  Co-workers/Colleagues are very open and always willing to help if they see you struggling with something or if you have questions, the only dumb question is the one you don't ask...I've always felt very comfortable here whether its talking about something serious or just joking around, everyone knows what's required of them so it makes it a fun environment that you can grow with knowledge and experience. As stated before, I don't think there is a hard part of the job because of the environment of course there are times when systems go down and you have to work a little extra but being in a team that works together and accomplishes one goal makes most jobs easier, and with any corporation you'll have ups and downs with systems.  I think everything I stated above describes how fun and enjoyable a job can be, but I also believe if you do not enjoy what you are doing how can you be happy?  I enjoy most the type of work I do, the people I work with and the management everyone is easy to get along"
