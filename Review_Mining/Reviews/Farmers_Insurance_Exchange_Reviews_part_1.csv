rating,review
bad,"Agents for this company are rude - they don't even understand or fully grasp the products they offer, and definitely do not perform their due diligence when selling products to their clients - commissions are more important to the Agents than helping the general public with Life Insurance and investment needs."
bad,"Lack of support, knowledge and compensation. Rates are through the roof I wouldn't reccomend Farmers Insurance to anyone especially family or friends. The independent agent I worked under was extremely unorganized, dishonest, and couldn't even complete the Acord forms correctly and often times ""bent the truth"" on applications for coverage. No training or ongoingsupport"
bad,"Unclear of goals, failure to lead, untrustworthy management, harassment environment, VERY greedy! Unfulfilled promises. "
bad,"terrible company do not care about its employees or agents, used to be family oriented getting rid of older agents without caring about their customers"
bad,Hated working here. Noone supported you and never got paid for what I sold. Business only lasted 8 months. Management was overpaid and loved to micro-manage employees. No help was ever given.
bad,"If you have a disability do not work here. They fire people that have disabilities. They will find reasons to fire you if you have a disability. Whether you have IBS, Cancer, ADHD, diabetes.... etc  They will manipulate their rating on you to fire you."
bad,"They expect you to kill yourself for 12/hour and there are absolutely ZERO perks to that job  the health insurance is great but super expensive.  You only get 30 minutes for lunch and they make you work mandatory overtime.  The typical hours are 12pm-8:30pm and with the mandatory overtime you must start your shift at 9:30am, so you aren’t able to do anything."
bad,no clear direction. no clear objectives. No clear standards. It was and is the worst job I have ever had. You will never know when you are in trouble and you will never know why.
bad,I would not work for Farmers ever again if given the chance. The corporation above the agents is very much like an organized crime syndicate.  I am glad to have met the agents I worked with but would have preferred to avoid Farmers.
bad,"Incredibly stressful, no benefits. I didn't gain any information. Manager was disrespectful and rude. Work atmosphere was stale and negative. The easiest part of the job was made difficult and confusing by the manager."
bad,"Even though it opened the door for me to get another trade/experience under my belt. I was in a toxic work environment & there was no consistency in the sales projections, bonus/compensation or overall agency policies and procedures."
bad,"District Managers will use false data to entice you into buying an agency with the knowledge they can commit fraud because they the backing of Farmers. "
bad,It's good for college students. The agent worked with my school schedule but there is little to no training for the actual job. Depends mainly on the agent you work for
bad,"I was so stressed out due to the amount of work piled up and no help from anybody. The agent was too busy to help, the office staff was the same as stressed out, so no help there, underwriters and service operation staff don't know what in the world is going on with the system so no help there, billing department keeps providing different solutions to a simple question, no help there either... In other words, Farmers isn't the type of company to work for the long term if you have a family to support.  None of the incentives I was offered when first hired on were met and after the year I was booted out right before I was getting ready to go on vacation. Gotta love Farmers Insurance. Don't waste your time applying unless you want to become one sick and stressed out person. Good luck!!!"
bad,"Culture constantly shifted.  Inconsistent management.  Poor communication, lack of trust, unrealistic expectations.  Your experience can drastically change depending on your supervisor.  Everyone in the department was frustrated and hated being there."
bad,Not a good place to work at. Very unpleasant place to work. Horrible customer service. Was not willing to worth with anything that needed to worked on
bad,All this job consisted of was cold calls.The manager then took the info and called them back to discuss switching insurance agency's If you didn't get enough they did not want you back. Worked there  3 days no pay.
bad,"Promises never kept, bonuses never paid. Most unethical company to be associated with. Training was horrible, they actually can't teach you anything at Farmers University because they are afraid to be sued."
bad,They cherrypicked people to be laid off. No severance package. No matter how well you do they consistently criticize your every move. Be smart & find something else!!!!
bad,"The Management had no real direction, the culture was constantly changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients. "
bad,"Farmers is a very disappointing and dishonest company/ who robbed me after 30 years of my life given to them, they are absolutely liars and played bait and switch games .... DO NOT EVER WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT EXPECTS YOU TO MEET SALES GOALS & AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWS AGENTS FROM FARMERS TO OPEN OFFICES LESS THAN A MILE AWAY FROM YOURS, NOT 1 OR 2 TIMES, 5 TIMES ....  very disloyal to agents with tenure!"
bad,"Work load will cause you to pull your hair out! Senior people that work there are rude and negative! Management has power trips and treat you less than you deserve by telling you your work is not good enough on a daily basis! Your constantly micro-managed and their training program sucksss!!!"
bad,"This was the most stressful job I've ever had and i was in the marine corps for 4 years and deployed to Afghanistan.  I had 4 managers during my year and a half here. They definitely don't care about people of color. If someone gets a claim in a bad area, they will.more than likely re assign it to the black person because other people are scared to go out there. They won't hesitate to send us to the remote country areas with Confederate flags everywhere though.  Stayal away if you want peace."
bad,Expectd to get 10 quotes a day and sell a multi lines policy every day. If you don't meet the sales goal you get verbally abused by manager and fired.
bad,"Minimum Wage, No Benefits, Underwriting & Claims are a Joke,  They pay for big commercials instead of paying for Insureds Claims. Rates keep going up. District office always hiring  agents w/ no experience and feeding them full of lies. Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,Poor management and a lot of favoritism from the so call leadership team. If you are not in the favor list of the leadership team you are not going to make it there. Worse company I had work for and they call it a 500 fortune company. I had way better experience with a non-standard insurance company.
bad,"Quoting/Selling Insurance to a wide variety of client's. Working with client's to get them the best Insurance coverage possible that best fit their needs. You build a relationship and help with issues or change's that may come up. "
bad,This particular insurance agent promised me a full-time position then he switched it to part-time to accommodate another young woman whom he hired only for her to quick within two weeks. This agent does not know how to run a business.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Customers always blaming you for their insurance going up. District managers are horrible. Farmers is out for themselves. They take a,lot of money out of the agents folio's. It a a very stressful job. Work elsewhere."
bad,"I learned alot about auto and home insurance. And a typical day at work would be accepting payments, answering emails and phone calls. The management was good."
bad,They do not take care of the customers.  They send customers who have paid up their bill to the collection agency.  Also they are terrible at keeping their promises to their employee.  They do not give additional commissions for additional work as promised.  DO NOT WORK HERE
bad,"-Be careful signing any agreements"
bad,"he took his family to Disneyland for 10 days and did not bother to pay us, he was never there, and we had way to many meetings, he expected a lot from us and gave us nothing, not even good pay, he lied to us a lot. he would not give us raises because he needed to keep up a goof lifestyle."
bad,Was sexually harassed by my boss several times. My boss had a drug issue. I wasn't properly trained on how to do my job but was expected to perform duties I didn't know how to do.
bad,"If you are going to be a csr make sure that you love sells and that you are willing to sell overpriced insurance for ""customer service experience"" whatever that means."
bad,"Wrong position and company for me.  No support.  Too high expectations.  No training.  And when I failed to have high enough sales, they sued me!  Never work there again."
bad,"It needs better management, they lack leadership skills, they play favoritism and are not will to hear you when you have a concern. It was rewarding to help the people that called."
bad,"This is not a general summary for all of the Farmer's Insurance Groups or Agencies across the country. "
bad,Very high work load for very low compensation in the claims area.  Very little training and resources and very high demands. High demands with very little support from mangers.
bad,High volume of work with no proper training pay was poor for amount of work required ... quick turn around with employees. Stressful environment and hostile
bad,"Company was very slow, boring nothing to do. Owner of the company was not willing to train, learn things the hard way. Owner has poor communication skill, no time to touch base."
bad,Farmers is a horrible place to work. It’s full of people in management that are corrupt. HR doesn’t care. The lack of professionalism runs rampant. There is no advancement.
bad,They don't care about the people. Shift bids every year and sometimes in less than a year. They say tenure is used as a tie breaker but somehow the longer tenure employees get pushed to later shifts. They reward brown nosing over actual production. They hold the advocates to high standards but not their agents. They not upfront either. They don't want you telling agents your reviewing things with your supervisor. Then when they get a supervisor request don't back their employee. They are pushing people out the door.
bad,I hated working for Farmers. Keep in mind that I worked for an agency and that doesn't necessarily reflect on the company itself but the agent I worked for was terrible. Very rude. Micro-managed.
bad,My agent was not someone good to work with. It is not a job for everyone and can be challenging when the agent a good one. I would not work for farmers again.
bad,"Farmers is in the middle of making major changes that are leaving the sales force in limbo.  As an agent I do not receive the support that was promised, in fact they have outsourced support.  "
bad,"Had health issues which were unexpected and lost agency.  Could not maintain 80+ hour weeks.  Promised the moon but the actuality was unexpected.  Worked hard for over a year, could not find reps who were willing to work hard and lost everything. Love insurance though and helping families protect their assets and lives.  Still working in the industry despite the Farmers experience."
bad,No managerial support. No collaboration among agents. Cut-throat environment. Low pay. Commission basis only. Too many agents from the same company in one area.
bad,"You are under a pyramid scheme of sales, you are told you own your insurance agency when in fact you really don't. The big decisions are made for you by a district manager, however; all the expenses that come along with owning your own business you are expected to pay."
bad,Worked for this company for just a few months.  Very regulated as they have to be.  You can at least understand natural disasters when they happen in your own back yard.
bad,"Low pay no growth                                                               "
bad,"This job was high stress. I had to learn insurance on my own from lack of training. I was dealing with very angry people on a daily basis."
bad,It was a cutthroat business with several agents that will STEAL business from you.  Quotas put into play were not realistic.  I would not recommend any new agent to work there.
bad,"This is an okay place to work.  Very corporate structure.  Success based on metrics.  Cut backs, changes and turnover almost every quarter.  Not many people make it to five years"
bad,Agents make their own rules and everything. I was on salary for 40 hours a week and would work up to 50 with no compensation for the overtime. It is not ideal for anyone. They pretty much can do whatever they want. My insurance agent also cheated on his life policies by paying previous clients and employees life insurance on his own so his numbers will be higher.
bad,"Horrible company to work with and for.  Agency owners are abusive and will make your life a living dungeon.  The manager I had was a terror to work with and for, very abusive."
bad,This company is a complete pyramid scheme you wouldn’t think so because of the name but complete scheme. They take people in so easily and once they’ve collected enough policies they try to audit you and look for any reason to get rid of you.
bad,I would never recommend this job to anyone.  It's all about numbers.  they don't care about the agent/client relationship.  Worst mistake i ever made in my life.
bad,"Their business model is asinine, Their training was juvenile, it was sad that I knew more about insurance than the person who was supposedly training me."
bad,Farmers is a great company despite all of the corporate changes. I worked for an agency that had poor management and poor employee engagement. I would recommend investigating reputations before accepting a position.
bad,I was an office manager for the district sales office.  I had a very new young boss as the DM who was afraid to utilize me as an actual office manager.  Instead I was a glorified receptionist.  I left because I was bored and not advancing in skills or being used to the best of my abilities.  I was very disappointed in this work assignment.  When I left they replaced me with an answering system.  They did not even see the need for an Office Manager.  There was no real infrastructure and the DM did not even know the meaning of this word when I explained this to him on my exit interview.
bad,"The Michigan Branch Legal office is a sweatshop. If you take your ethical obligations to the State Bar of Michigan seriously, do not work for Farmers."
bad,Bad management and not enough opportunity for advancement. The management was a dictatorship and did not invest in the employees regarding skills that could further their business.
bad,"Horrible management. Not smart, better to work at a retail place than Farmers. If you need to work for Farmers make sure you get everything you talk to management in writing."
bad,Did not work out with this owner. There were other agents who were doing shady deals to make quota and the upper management knew yet did nothing about it since they looked good to corporate.
bad,"If you can fit into the click you will go far, have a brain and your own ideas and you are blackballed. I would not recommend this company to anyone long term but if you got bills to pay and you keep to yourself at all times except meeting you still will hate it"
bad,"First time selling insurance. Horrible training, huge expections, had to start a book of business from scratch. Had a quota that went up every month. Very hard to attain"
bad,I was never happy when I worked here. The agents are crooked along with the company who is dishonest and alters documents. There isn't anything good I can say about this company or any of it's employees. I'm actually having to deal with an attorney now regarding my agent not depositing my federal taxes.
bad,Training lacked a LOT. The training enviornment does not set you up for the actual job. Management doesn't care about their people. This place has a long way to go.
bad,"I worked as an agent with them for 6 years.  Every year had a large rate increase, impossible to build a book of business and had way to many agents in each town just trying to make a living.  If you want to get into insurance I recommend becoming and Independent agent or Allstate."
bad,"This company nearly devastated me financially. I sold a boat, a truck and also took out a home equity line of credit to try and get an agency off the ground. Farmers gave me some money too but it was a deal with the devil contract because most of their agents fail and if you don't hit the numbers they quit giving you money, have a collection agency set up exclusively for their agents. They then set up a payment plan, and keep all of the policies that you signed and redistribute them to other agents. Don't just take my word for it do a little research like I should have done. Run the other way and if you want to be an agent go fully independent. You will be much better off in the long run in my opinion."
bad,Not enough time to do training while at work so it had to be done at home.  The agent was not in the office much for training on how to sell insurance.
bad,The work environment was very cut throat and hostile. Several agents either quit or were let go and the district manager was fired for insurance fraud.
bad,agents had little or no knowledge of insurance the company or policies. there was zero job security and no support system at any point while working for him.
bad,Farmers Insurance was the first time I got into property and Casualty part of the insurance industry. I was able to help clients with personal lines business needs educate them on different coverage options.
bad,Farmers sucks. Managers are liars who only promote their friends. Recruiters lie. Low pay...low vacation days. HORRIBLE supervisors in low level jobs who think they’re CEOs
bad,This is a typical insurance company.  It has an extremely poor business model which is based on a game of pure numbers.  Throw a dart at a board and eventually one sticks.  The training was poor and very little guidance is provided by management.
bad,Farmers cut the commissions of their hardworking agency owners. I have been with them for 3 years and taken 3 cuts along with 5 rate increases. Makes it almost impossible to make money
bad,"I learned a lot about Auto Insurance Policies, a typical day consisted of about 6 hours of being allocated to nothing but your chair and computer. Bathroom breaks are monitored."
bad,"I did not like and this company is not good at all. You work all kinds of hours for low pay, you aren't appreciated and don't really go anywhere other then a commission only sales agent."
bad,I do not have anything nice to say about Farmers Insurance except they gave me training in insurance. If you want to start a career in the insurance business be an a independent agent not captive. That way you can work in the best interest of your clients.
bad,I was an agency owner with Farmers. My district manager talked me into opening my own office as a start up.  I quoted many people but the Farmers rates were much higher than the competitors and it was hard to get business.
bad,Have 6yrs of prev P&C ins exp. my pay started the same as a person that worked at restaurant their entire life w/no prev exp. Manag.lack diversity.Bad
bad,racial slurs about ethnicity made me feel bad about my ethnicity when he would say such slander then id have to go throughout the day feeling uneasy until id go home
bad,"Horrible Managers that created hostile environment and encouraged conflict among employees, very inconsistent.  Watch your back with employees trying to climb ladder or keep their jobs."
bad,"This place is a joke, high stress, low employee moral, lots of overweight employees, no one is happy and the management are not nice people.  They expect you to work over time because the work load is so high you can never catch up.    Management only cares about numbers not their employees or customers they cheat them out of money on claims always looking for a way not to pay."
bad,"lack of commision, no training provided and lack of communication."
bad,"The owner of the agency did not pay our commissions as he was supposed to. Never was given a gas allowance. Was not given renewal commissions. Not enough sales support was provided. Very stressful workplace. Most days we were expected to eat lunch at our desk and continue to do our jobs. No health benefits were offered.Office manager was allowed to come and go as need be. Turn over rate at the agency was horrible, I worked with at least twenty different agents in the years I was with this job."
bad,They over promise and under deliver.  They say you will make tons of money then they spend it for you.  After all the cost of doing business your lucky if you make anything at all
bad,"While I learned a great deal about how not to run a business, this was not a positive experience......................................................"
bad,"I was a claims adjuster for Bristol West Insurance, which is a non-standard insurance and subsidiary of Farmers Insurance. This company is extremely unprofessional, managed poorly and has no sense of direction. They have the worse training which is led by a group of trainers that bicker and argue throughout the training class. In addition, they literally belittle new employees and make training an uncomfortable environment where you are afraid to ask questions. Once training is over, your thrown onto the floor were you are left to sink of swim. Management does not want to be bothered with you. It almost feels like you're the new kid at school that everyone ignores."
bad,Workplace was depressing and it was difficult to advance within the company. The pay was unfair based on the amount of work we performed. Management was horrible.
bad,"they do not support there employees, the job is basically good pay but you have to get along with certain people if not you will not b promoted, they say it is an open door policy big lie"
bad,It was the most hostile environment I have ever seen in my 30+ years working.  During the 15 or so months I was employed by him I witnessed at least 13 other employees quit because of how arrogant and hostile he was.
bad,"The Management team at Farmers Home office fire any agent making too much in commissions.  You work long hours, pay for everything and they keep paying less and asking for more."
bad,"I worked for a private agent who was new to the city and was just getting started. I spent a lot of time getting the office organized and ready for the agents to work efficiently and find everything they needed, while also working as a receptionist for all calls coming in and going out."
bad,"this place is bad not r recomended to work what so ever my manager was bad bd never show up to work and will pay very little ,  she will bring her dogs"
bad,"I was with the company for 16 years and was very successful, with consistent promotions and advancement. Approximately 3 years ago I received a new manager who was biased and racist. My career changed drastically and eventually made the decision to leave the company that I had every intention of retiring from to get away from the stress and harassment."
bad,"Helped customer with there insurance needs. Handled payments , renewal, account payable. I enjoyed interacting with customers and giving them the best of my knowledge. Regarding there insurance. I call myself a customer service specialist. I enjoy helping customers with there needs."
bad,Company contacted me to set up a phone interview time and did not follow through. They gave no explanation. Extremely unprofessional and would not recommend to anyone in New Jersey.
bad,"I have had 5 or 6 district managers from Farmer's insurance ask me me to come work for them as an agent, because it's sooo rewarding and a great place to work.... After 3 of them emailing me again in the same week, I finally agree to work for them as an agent, it was horrible. They provide 0 leads to you, but expect you to pick apart at family and friendships to turn them into business relationships.  Training comprised of impersonal, impractical, out-of-touch computer modules, and the same manager(s) that continually pursue you with emails to work for them, barely ever work an 8 hour day themselves, and that's not counting frequent 2 hour lunch breaks and or golf outings. They also lied to me about a compensation hiring bonus once I came on board. Being an insurance agent is not easy getting started, and Farmer's business plan largely neglects new agents. The leadership frankly appears not to care. No direction, leadership, nor help with planning and strategy... nothing."
bad,This is not a company that i enjoyed working for it was not flexable with my work needs and the pay was not always what it was supposed to be it did not allow me to advance in where i needed to be and i felt like over all i got screwed
bad,"Weak leadership within agency. Not speaking on all agencies, just the local one here in town. Things are promised that do not transpire. Organization is very weak."
bad,Get out before you ever get switch'n'bait or snaked into it.  Very dishonest and makes you feel dirty in your skin kind of job if you are for the good of the common people and not to take advantage of them.
bad,The management team and HR are terrible. They cann't really solve the problem so the people were fighting each other for customers. Most of the people who work for Farmers has no education or a good background. I see people come and go all the time coz they were yelling to each other and fighting.
bad,"Had to fully fund the entire purchase and secure brick and mortar building out of your own pocket."
bad,The worst company I've ever worked for..!! The manager was rude and they did not allow time to train or even teach me anything. They just threw me in there with a cash drawer. They also cuss and yell at their employees!
bad,"Company is the absolute worst. Their district managers would try to sell you the dream to become an agent, make really good money... but its a very difficult business to get into since you are a captive agent. Independent agencies is where the money really is at. My DM was sexist, and occasionally casually threw in some racial micro-aggressions, no accountability what-so-ever since DM are also contract based. It would be nice if you had a HR department to report your manager. To be successful in this company would depend a lot on where you live. Rates are high but that can be leveled out with more customers you try to obtain."
bad,Team leads and managers do not often communicate to each other despite the fact they stay in meetings all day rather than do actual work. Absolutely no clear path on how to advance. Most people in the company stay in the position they were hired for till quitting.
bad,Stressful sales and little compensations. Over worked and under paid. Management didn't know what they were doing. Expected too much for too little pay.
bad,Be careful working for this organization or else you may end up fired if you find out about an affair that you didn't even want to know about in the first place. They make promises they can not keep and have no understanding of sick days.
bad,"I felt that i didn't have to training that I needed to be successful. And the main thing was the rate.  Farmers, rates was so high i cannot best the rate that people already had.  And i did a lot of calling people and quoting people. I just stayed their just to get the experience."
bad,The office manager was never in charge or on time. He is very unprofessional and not educated enough about his own job title or work area. Needs more work done.
bad,"I was hired as a agent business owner, but was treated as an employee. Had to pay rent on top of a bunch of cost. Then was fired for not hitting quota"
bad,"The ad  was misleading and said it was customer sales rep position with room for growth and once I started it ended up being strictly a telemarketing position. I worked there for 2 days and it literally was all day, 9-5 straight soliciting to people over the phones. Paid training consisted of maybe 2 min, I was given a headset and was told to read word for word from the packet they give you. It was ridiculous so I quit after 2 days and my check was withheld from me almost a month because the guy couldn't keep track of me working only 2 days, which was pathetic."
bad,"Farmers Insurance went from an American company in the 1990's to two sales later, Zurich International..........they could care less about anything but GREED...........good luck with this company who is full of lies and greed."
bad,Personal assistant in San Angelo Tx. Customers were always mad at the agent.  He would not take time to teach his employees anything but had time to yell at them and go hunting. The Agent was very unprofessional and lacked motivation for his own customers.
bad,Working with Farmers Insurance allowed me to realize what I really wanted to do with my career. I learned all about customer service and customer satisfaction.
bad,The company is overall terrible. They do a terrible job at communicating job requirements to the employee. They were terrible hours.
bad,I do not recommend working here.  The management is uneducated and once people have reached a certain pay grade they are let go and those with lower pay grades take over their positions to prevent having to pay high wages.
bad,I learned that whoever owns the company runs it not farmers insurance. There were issues that were brought up to the Districts office and nothing was done to correct them and I was baiscally told that whoever owns it runs it Farmers does not interviene on any rules they may have for the office.
bad,they will just throw you to the wolves.  Training and management are subpar.  You will end up broke and paying back loans if you take the advances.  Don't do it.
bad,"I enjoyed selling Farmer's products, but be careful who you work for.  That could make or break the job.  I sold Farmer's through an independent agent."
bad,"The managers are incompetent and have no business being in charge of other people.  They will lie to your face, make false promises and do anything necessary to make themselves look good at the expense of everyone else.  The nastier the manager the more they get promoted!!  This company is composed of control freaks who try to dictate your behavior in the office and in your private life out of the office.  The other attorneys are a bunch of backstabbers who cannot be trusted."
bad,"Little training, hard to obtain guidance support. You are expected to figure things out on your own. Which means that at the beginning you will turn off customers which hits hard when you have to fight just to get to talk to customers."
bad,"they claim you will make lots of money, they claim you will have all kinds of time to spend with family when it is all a lie. then they find all sorts of reasons to force you out of company to keep your policies and take your money. they want you to work 7 days a week 20 hours a day. the district manager is a joke in Knoxville. Horrible person"
bad,"They treated the customers horrible, the employees horrible. They were unorganized, and I just didn't agree with a lot they were oing so I couldn't give my all."
bad,"Was not trained well before having to push policies on customers, did enjoy working directly with customers, got to visit customers in person"
bad,Pay is very low compared to other insurance companies and a constant revolving door of employees.  Very little job security as management tries to encourage better work product by scaring you that you'll be fired if you do not perform better.
bad,"hardest part of the job is never being home to spend any quality time with family or friends, stuck on the same shift for 5 years even though others have managed to get earlier shifts."
bad,"sink or swim, don't use you immediate network, you'll have some success at first, that will eventually run out, then you have to prospect, which isn't always for the faint of heart, for a $70 commission on an auto policy."
bad,"Poor management, poor work environment, they grind their employees then fire or force them out"
bad,"My year and a half at Farmers was the most tiring, stressful and unhappy  time of my life. The work load is too much and the pay isn't worth the amount of work expected from you. Farmers billing and computer systems are a complete mess and everything that is implemented never works i.e. SIMS, ECMS, CLBIZ Billing, etc"
bad,"Absolutely nothing good to say about this company. Old school, poor management, no training or tools to do your job properly. High turnover."
bad,"will not disclose customer information or management of business in writing, must be face to face."
bad,"Coworkers were nice for the most part. Management, in an effort to boost ratings, pulled the original review I wrote because it defined all the problems in detail with management, supervisors and saving money by claims reps against the injured party. Supervisors did not supervise. Any opinions or suggestions not offered by supervisors were not given the light of day. The open door policy is a joke as management always backed supervisors against employees no matter what. No advancement opportunities available. Matrix ""raises"" were based on how well liked you were and not on production. "
bad,"The first flag went off the moment I received a call from the Farmers recruiter offering me a job, I noticed the way she offered a job was different than any other job offer I had ever received before, with a lot of disclosures, regarding schedule, job environment and needless to say low salary that left me wondering if I was making the right move."
bad,Use extreme caution before moving up quickly in this company.  Moving up fast caused me to get laid off the week prior to bonuses being released.  My evaluation was one of full praise and was promised a large bonus due to my work ethic.  Then I was let go so the bonus did not have to pay out the bonus.
bad,"A typical day answering call, making call, setting appointments, cold calls, tracking leads, watching the both."
bad,Typical day to log on to 12 different systems that you dont even use
bad,This agent knew what she was doing.  I busted my behind for her and I was never shown any ammount of respect.
bad,"This was a temporary job. Let as soon as the"
bad,i did not like farmers insurance at all they really wasnt professional and i wish that i had a better experience with them
bad,"I have learned sales, management and business development skills"
bad,"I make cold calls by telephone to the business community building up our pipeline with prospects. We offer them a free quote on all of their business insurance. Also, I set up meetings for my boss & the agency producers to go on. Fill out the accord forms &  get them ready for quoting. Check MVR's, answer the phones, make sure all meetings are kept. There is extensive follow up duties, lots of telemarketing to make sure everything is taken care of in a very timely manner."
bad,Very hard to work here because of how customers were never the first priority. I did what I could and made a success out of helping the Spanish speaking customers.
bad,"Horrible environment, I stayed longer than anyone I was working with in my position; Upper management lied continually, would only keep most employees for a certain amount of time and then fire them to save money.  Very sad place. They overwork you and purposefully set goals that are unreachable to always have the upper hand; I am excellent at what I do and was continually dismayed at their corporate culture, very unethical, dishonest, and .... greedy for upper management bonuses. They do not care about their people. It does not matter how good you are at your job. And it is, of course, very political."
bad,"a typical day was nothing more than stocking shelves and pointing customers in the right firection."
bad,"Went through some extensive time consuming training to be completely disappointed by this company.  Save your time and money by passing up any ""opportunities"" they may offer. "
bad,this office is no longer open.  Agent no longer servicing only serviced for a short period of time due to personal reasons.
bad,"Their Training programs are outdated and laughable. The so called "" hot leads"" they supplied were 1- 2 yrs old. It seems that you are a commission based ""slave"" to do data mining and list verification for free. They say you are going into business with them, but what they mean is that they will use you and abuse you at little or no cost for them."
bad,District manager is a habitual liar. Talks out of both sides of his mouth. State Leader looks at agents as a number and as a means to get what he wants. Threats are abundant in regard to losing contract. Go with another company and do not subject yourself to this company.
bad,"Management is only interested in policy count, no focus given to producers and assistance. Company always has a hand in your wallet taking much more than they ever give. Everything is a folio deduct. Accounting cannot justify accounts and the contract is only one sided with the benefit to Farmers"
bad,There are better places to start business in the insurance industry.  Shop around. 
bad,"Without a doubt the worst experience of my lifetime. Unless you're looking to be saddled with debt, stay away from Cherry Hill in specific. Incompetence and deceit from top down, especially at the top."
bad,"No Loyalty to Employees, Good co-workers."
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. It started from recruiter who lied to me regarding salary ( he said it is withdrawal method of salary but it is really not, that there is no need to worry about paying back???). My managers were just underqualified and rude. I can just go on and on about scam tricks they were teaching us and about poor customer service they were showing us. I will do everything to talk my friends and family out of working for this company. I do not recommend it to anyone, unless you want to work for free, still owe them money and being managed by mean and underqualified people."
bad,During the day I learned all about insurance and how to process transactions. I was working with an agent and his CSR. Agent usually was gone all day during the week and it was just me and the other CSR. She was very unprofessional she told me that she wanted to have sexual intercourse on the desk and made me feel very uncomfortable. Which made me respond with her acting promiscuous which led me to getting fired because I honestly believe the agent and her were having an affair?
bad,"Became a agent as part of the first class and will soon fail to validate along with 85 percent of the class. I will leave with a 20000 loan that they will soon send to collections. They created a retail program that is even worse, and although they sold me into owning my own business now they're trying to sell me into taking a 14hr job. Initially we were getting 21st century leads but now those have dried up. Management is unbelievable unqualified beside one sales manager. The recruiters lie to your face about the rates, and how many people succeed. The agency manager does nothing all day but try to get you to come in his office so he can talk nonsense. He has no sales or management experience. Run from this company if they call you."
bad,"The hours were horrible, the pay was horrible, the job overall was just HORRIBLE."
bad,This company is a disgrace. If you would like to deal with incompetence at all levels then do apply here!
bad,"This is a SCAM!!! They will contact people without any experiance and throw big dollar signs in front of them. DM has a quota to get several agents to ""career"" status each year. ""If"" one makes it that far, they have brrb known to terminate if the numbers do not meet the quota for the month/quarter."
bad,Farmers is a major scam and horrible orginization with no values or ethics.
bad,Will fire you if you have medical issues with medical documentation even if you have cancer
bad,Lack of concern for employees health issues even if medically documented. Will fire you if you have cancer.
bad,"It has turned out to be a big pyramid scheme, where the people at the top benefit from your hard work and you gain nothing."
bad,"I took the job knowing I would probably learn to eventually hate it as it is a call center because I was desperate for a higher paying job than my previous one. The first week of training they brainwash everyone into thinking that Farmers is the best company to work for. They even provide random gifts and etc. It only took a few months out of training that I realized it I was going to be miserable. The job description provided is not accurate. This job will be a nightmare if you hate call centers.You will be on the phones from the moment you get in until the moment you get off, it became very draining. You will be judged on everything from productivity, quality, efficiency, adherence and so on. Micro-managing is probably the best way to describe the company. You meet once a week with your supervisor to go over your goals, numbers, etc. I've worked for many large companies and farmers provides nothing special in regards to benefits. Their work life balance was poor. Their benefits are decent but not great. I would not recommend working here unless you are extremely desperate for a job and don't mind being on the phone."
bad,Agent that I worked for was not the greatest lots of no no's that were done.
bad,This is the worst place to work ever. They don't listen to employees and when large numbers of employees quit you are expected to just pick up the slack like nothing happened.
bad,Management did not understood your values. Unrealistic expectations.
bad,"it was a good learning experience, but the owner had to leave town for family issues"
bad,Dont take any job job with Farmers. They just keep giving you more work and no more pay. They are abusive in my opinion. Alot of older people there are retiring and running for the hills. Many new people just quit. A very sad enviroment in which to work!!!
bad,office ws run with inept management team
bad,"Note that the reviews on this page are often for agents or Claims, which is different from the Management company. This company suddenly reduced benefits, cut salary increases and has a habit of finding ways to fire people because its more efficient than laying them off. Unfortunately, this can be stressful for the person who was fired for non-issues."
bad,This company is pushing 20 year service people out and they treat new people horribly. Farmers is ate up with employee lawsuits and it is a sinking ship!!! Run from this job or you will be sorry!!!
bad,I worked here 20 years and saw Farmers deteriorate badly. It is very unfriendly to employees and pushes them out where possible. They are ate up with employee lawsuits. Run from this job or you'll be sorry!!!
bad,Farmers will change your next week bonus this week. Bottom of the barrel captive insurance agency. Their pricing isn't competitive. Terribleexperi reindeer
bad,"Parent company was Farmers. Maybe things are better there over Foremost/Bristol West/21st Century."
bad,"Huge commission cuts after a couple years of working there, and after having bought a book of business causing it to be devalued overnight. The amount of the cut happened to be about the same percentage that the CEO got as a raise (he went from 95 million a year to 120)"
bad,Underwriting is a disaster.  They use multiple forms for each company they use.  Takes to long and the clients get upset waiting.  Online insurance is killing the market.
bad,"I have been with the company for nearly 5 years now as an adjuster in multiple different departments. Each department is the same as the last, promises of career advancement which never seem to pan out along with management that is completely out of touch with the job expecting completely unrealistic results."
bad,"They will hire you on, pump you for family and friends business and then let you go. Never had a company hype something up so much and then take zero responsibility for the agents assigned to run their locations. Happy to be done with that job."
bad,Farmers Insurance is a poor company to work for since they do not keep their word and give very little help when needed on the job. Management was not supportive and never gave any positive feedback. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Poor and incompetent managers."
bad,Degrading supervisors. Disappointed with their promises for advancement. Years and years wasted as I was treated like a disposable workhorse to only benefit the company. The management is extremely contradicting to the farmers beliefs. Can honestly say I would never recommend a career through Farmers insurance.
bad,This was by far one of the worst companies I worked for in my 30+ years in the industry.  I would not recommend them to anyone looking for employment in this field
bad,"You are on your own! They are in it for themselves no fair compensation plan, underpaid and overworked. The rates aren't comparable or even close to other companies and they expect you to write business anyway even if we are $150 more per month. No time off for death in family."
bad,"Company has no concern for their Agents or Clients.   Very poorly run company.   They cut commissions while making largest profits in history.  No benefits & a lot of stress to sell, sell, sell."
bad,"slow paced. my boss was not helpful, would leave me alone without any gaudiness and supervision. not enough employee. i would be bored all the time because there was nothing to do"
bad,Unprofessionally on all aspects specially with clients. Bad environment. Don't follow rules or policies. Farmers hire inexperienced and unlicensing people to sell insurance.
bad,Loss of words. False advertisement about the job. The compensation wasn't no where near what I was told. As a matter of fact I ended up owing them money from a draw.
bad,Was difficult to make sales quota with products that were not competitively priced with those of their competitors. Some goals were unrealistic for start-up insurance agencies.
bad,"They state that they promote from within, they do not. They have had such a hard time finding people to work people cannot advance from their current position, however people off the street with less experience will get the position because they cannot hire for the lower positions. They time your bathroom breaks and personal time and you get in trouble if you are off the phones or take too long on a phone call. During the Training class we lost 1/3 of the class, due to their strict rules. A girl came into class sick, so sick she was almost passing out they let her go because she needed to go home. Out of a class of 30 maybe 5 are still at the job in less than a year...that just shows how they treat their employees."
bad,The job was enjoyable to an extent. The manager didn't offer any benefits and I felt there was no future here. They wanted me to eventually be an insurance agent and that was nothing I was interested in.
bad,"It is very true that you can make a very good living with Farmers. However, it isn't the easiest job in the world. The job is even more difficult when you have to take a good portion of your earnings, and put it towards your own marketing. Making your income that much smaller."
bad,"When I came into this position, my employer and myself had very high hopes and expectations for me.   However, the specific agency that I worked for was not financially stable at the time that I was hired, this was ongoing until the time I was laid off. "
bad,"Only 1 in 6 people make it. The other people will owe the company thousands of dollars in ""loans""."
bad,"They give you a decent base in a down economy, then a fluffy 2week training program by people who have no idea what they're doing. Then prepare to look people in the face and lie to them 2 to 3 times a day. If you have a pulse and can get liscensed then you can be an agent but we have to hire 8 recruiters to talk the dredges of society into doing it. Full well knowing that after 6 months only 20% of the people will succeed. And that other 80% leave with collection notices for anywhere to 9k -16k."
bad,"bad mgmt, horrible training. mgmt does not care about anyone except themselves. as long as service schedules are met, mgmt will receive bonuses and there pay raises, employees do not receive anything."
bad,"I worked in the Customer Service Department taking claims over the phone. They treat every employee like a number. They do not care about the customer or employees. They micro-manage every little thing. Employees are treated like puppets. If you are not kissing up to management, chances are that you will not be promoted. Do not believe the job description. There is no structure whatsoever. If they hire too many people, they will look for anything that you have done, no matter how minor or major, and they will let you go. Don't believe it when they tell you that they are focused on employee retention. It is bogus. The claims department does not know how to run itself or treat their employees. Everything they say is too good to be true. They are inflexible. They do not care if you have an emergency that requires an absence from work. Many people quit because of the mistreatment they receive by management. You would think such a ""GREAT"" company like Farmers would do a better job at training their employees and thus eliminating the need to keep hiring so many people for this department, right? Wrong. The training staff is terrible. Do other insurance companies keep hiring for this type of position? NO! Just Farmers. They do not know how to train or retain their employees. Do yourself a favor, do not apply for a job with Farmers or 21st Century. You are just another number to them."
bad,"A typical day included cold calling, cultivating contacts and selling."
bad,"Since the company was bought out by Zurich International Insurance, the workplace became unbearable. The company doesn't recognize the need for downtime/personal time. They felt they owned you. The workload doubled and management had unrealistic demands. They overlaoded you with work so you couldn't meet basic customer service standards. Run, don't walk away from this company."
bad,"There are promises of a six figure income, support, you'll be your own business owner! OK, so you will own your own business! What they don't tell you is you take ALL the risk, take all the losses and Farmers walks away with nothing but profit from you......so that supposed six figures really means if you make 100K your actually taking home after their ineptitude in the back offices and billing, having to have staff hired just to deal with Farmers mess ups on files, buying your own leads, and paying EVERYTHING ELSE, you get to keep maybe 45K that's if your making 100K off the bat NOT!!! You'll really put in 14 to 16 hour days prospecting and maintaining the clients you sign up.....then watch as a little charge from corporate here a charge back (that's when a clients policy gets cancelled and you pay back your full commissions no matter how long they've been on the books) there, and next thing you know a solid month clearing 2k to 3k becomes a 1k month and you still have to pay for your leads approximately $300 a month and your office I'm lucky it's only $300 a month so then that leaves you with around 7 to 8 hundred a month to survive on......so if your looking to own your own business AWESOME! Just don't do it through Farmers where you reap little to no reward and they walk away with everything to the bank! Oh and they will tell you how you can pass the business on to your kids.....ummm....NO! You can pass 500 of your policies to your kids and they will only get about 40% of your books commissions paid while Farmers keeps the rest! I haven't even gone into the fact that other"
bad,"I had never worked in insurance before and was enthusiastic to start the auto claims adjuster job.  Training was ok, but I felt they rushed the training to get us up on the floor (six weeks).  I didn't feel I had received adequate skills to start my job successfully.  I had the most awful Supervisor. She picked on me everyday and when I asked for help she said she didn't know the ""new system"" and to ask one of my peers.  My peers and I were so overloaded with claims that no one had time to help me.  I asked several times for help and was told I was not the only one on the team and to find help elsewhere."
bad,"Could be a great work environment. However, there is no help.   If you do not have the money to do what is necessary.  It will not provide an income.  Hard for someone starting out with no assets."
bad,No structure. VERY little training. A lot of goofing off by others in the office. Paid only once a month. Horrible location. Leads not provided. A lot of negativity
bad,"Upper management, directors, vice presidents, CEO, CCO have no clue how to run a large corporation like Farmers Insurance.  This has lead to massive policy loss and loss of business the last 5 years. Due to poor decision making Farmers Insurance continues to lay people off, including agents, claims personnel."
bad,"Do not recommend this job. I invested my money and never received any training or help. It’s a rip off and your DM is the on,y one making money, usually your money."
bad,"They lure you in with a salary higher than most insurance companies. The LONG training seems like it is preparing you for the job and then you start and everything changes. All that matters is surveys, but it's nearly impossible to only get positive ones. Even if you do, your only reward is more work. You'll spend 99% of your time on the phones, mostly getting yelled at by angry people. Expect to work overtime everyday and STILL have more work than you can handle. Some supervisors are good and that will make the job ok for a while, but most are either clueless or just don't care about their employees. Also, the benefits are overpriced and the deductibles are EXTREMELY high. Everyone I know that still works there is ACTIVELY looking for other jobs."
bad,"If you love a high pressure environment with supervisors and directors who love writing you up for silly stuff, this is the place for you! Pay is not in scale with the rest of Austin."
bad,This place has a high turnover with managers playing favorites.  There is a support staff that is way overworked for being coached.   There are 3 full time trainers for new CSRs due to the high turnover.  Of all the people that started in my training class 2 years ago it is down to NONE. I did walk away with a good amount in my 401k in a short time.
bad,"Where to start? By far the most miserable environment I have ever worked in. It was completely toxic every day. As others have stated, you are given a handful of claims which is fine at first and then they turn it up to 15-20 a day or more. You’re also expected to write your own estimates which always results in an argument with the customer or body shop over how much we can pay per hour and what can be included in the repairs."
bad,Be careful. They will oversell you on pay and compensation. You will work for a month until you realize the commission isn’t exactly what you thought it was. The Calahan agency doesn’t even pay minimum wage- or sick time.
bad,Terrible hours and days to work - Worked in Direct Service in Phx AZ - WOULD NEVER recommend this job to anyone...  Plan on working nights and weekends.  Can only advance if - well - you like someone LIKE you..
bad,"I work virtually with little to no supervision. I was the Number one ranked Recruiter in 2017 and was also promoted in 2017. I was able to obtain my Property and Casualty License as well. Company has experienced a high turnover rate, a great deal of change in a very short period of time. Poor communication.Poor leadership with minimal follow -up and Communication. While working virtually, I receive little to no supervision with minimal feed-back on performance. Minimal follow up with e-mail communication."
bad,Farmers has let go of thousands of people recently due to a decision to liquidate and sunset 21st Century Insurance which they acquired from AIG. I had to spend all my days dismantling everything I built watching everyone I care about get let go. They pay well and that's it - the culture is one of micromanagement and leadership through fear.
bad,"To say that the claims department is a ""fast-paced work environment"" is an understatement. Duties and expectations change on weekly basis and the amount of work required to meet performance expectations just keeps piling up without compensation being adjusted (for nearly 2 years in my experience). Be prepared to be overworked with little satisfaction or positive reinforcements as your daily inventory is less than manageable."
bad,"Poor work environment. reducing staff. over worked, no job security, Company is focusing on how to cut corners and save money. Company has a very poor management team"
bad,"Typical workday consists of cold calling, call center, writing policies, customer service, computer work, appointment setting and meeting customers.  Property, casualty, and financial licenses."
bad,"Large degree of difference between staff evaluation between supervisors. Anyday, someone could call you in and make statements about your work performance. Supervisors would have staff member perform significant additional work to prove that you are worthy of your job."
bad,More interested in bringing in new agents with no experience or training than supporting longer tenured agents. Over saturated the DFW with agents with no interest in keeping a successful agent force.
bad,The managment team has created a hostile work environment and selectively enforces guidelines and best practices.  Consistently undermines employees.  Consistently fails to address employee concerns and a high rate of turnover.
bad,"Some jobs shouldn't be converted to call center functions, but when you can mass process claims, this is what you get. It's a high-paced job with stringent demands and a steep learning curve."
bad,"Farmers is a multi-line insurance company that does not offer competitively priced polices for home, auto, business or life insurance."
bad,I worked for an independent office. The culture in the office was horrible. He had his wife and grandkids working there. The job duties were alright it was just the manager and his wife were not fun or good to work for.
bad,I worked here as an Insurance Agent. Not a lot of support or training is given. Working with the clients was the best part for me. The worst part was the stress level given the type of work involved and the importance of making sure the customer is insured properly.
bad,"I worked at an independent location which utilized one agent. The job duties were very basic and enjoyable. I could have easily enjoyed a simple career as a front desk assistant. I enjoyed when I had clients and when I was busy with office work."
bad,"bad financial decisions along with events now coming to a fruition have led me to rank them low. "
bad,"this is a place i do not want to work any longer ,the district manager and his staff are good people ,but they sucks at training their agents. i leant basically everything by myself."
bad,"It was a sweatshop. No human could keep up with the amount of work that was expected every day all day. Lots of office politics. Think twice before you take this job.  You are promised by your supervisor to teach you ""their way"" of doing things, but six months later you were not taught things properly and get a thank you, but no thank you (if you get my drift).   Co-workers always talking behind your back.  There was nothing enjoyable about working with this company."
bad,"I worked for Farmers for over 15 years. The first few years were great. However, after a while, you get to be too expensive and therefore become expendable. Also, they don't like it if you have an opinion, especially if it differs from their vision. They will do whatever it takes to silence the problem. The only plus of this place are the benefits and vacation time, both of which were fantastic. However, that doesn't really outweigh the incompetence of management and their desire to peer over your shoulder the entire time."
bad,I have been working at Farmers for a few months they do not have time to train you unless you purchase a book of business. they want you to buy your business.
bad,Price pressure career not as client centered as you would hope. Learn a lot about the insurance industry. Interesting place to work.
bad,"The high turn over rate should be a huge red flag.  High stress, poor morale, poor management overall (a few exceptions).    I could understand a new grad trying to get some experience, but I wouldn't count on staying here too long.   If the insanity doesn't make you quit, management will boot you out the door eventually."
bad,A lot of people in one business can get hectic and chaotic. They are a fun group of people but organization needs much work.
bad,If your are not a butt kisser do not even bother applying.  No matter how hard you work they always find a reason to complain. very stressful job
bad,"Farmers has rated themselves almost completely out of competition in home rates in the area which makes it extremely difficult to write new business.  The district recruiters made it seem as if becoming a Farmers agent would be an easy and lucritive transition.  I was given minimal training and was pushed into an office to take care of an existing book of business and forgotten about.  Since then, several Farmers agents, some of which have been with the company for numerous years, have resigned as an agent because of Farmers current rate structure.  Farmers has done nothing to correct the problem making it difficult for agents to survive and support their families."
bad,"This role gives me the opportunity to change the face of the insurance industry one client at a time.  I have been able to build some great relationships with my clients and other agents.  I have been fortunate to make it this far."
bad,Training is given. They say it's completely okay to ask for help and then get irritated because you ask for help. They get busy and throw you on the phones blind while technically still in training. They claim to be a great company. A family company. They are in fact cold and heartless and feel it's okay to let people go with no explanation. I'm surprised the better business bureau hasn't been called on them more.
bad,"Extremely long work days with excessive work load 60hr weeks plus and only getting salary, not hourly, this may have changed later because of legal lawsuit  in California to correct this issue in the insurance industry, poor training and questionable policies from management."
bad,It was a sweatshop. No human could keep up with the amount of work that was expected every day all day. Lots of office politics. Think twice before you take this job.
bad,"5 years ago this was the place to be! Now, employees are leaving like rats on a sinking ship! They have completely changed the way they audit your performance and now it is all based on ""behavior,"" which is a euphemism for: if you don't do what we say, when we say it, with a big smile on your face, your behavior is bad and you aren't meeting your performance goals. Don't apply here unless you want to work at a dead end job, with no hope of advancement and no praise for a job well done."
bad,Parent company is Zurich. It is constantly micromanaged by Zurich who steals profits that used to be shared with employees. In recent years it has made it difficult on older experienced employees forcing then to find other jobs or retire (probably to save on pension payouts).
bad,This company at the claims level is extremely demanding with little help when asked for. The growth is only available to people they hand select and the promote people to management that do not have any idea what they are in charge of. It was very difficult to keep up with what they wanted with the constant changing of protocal and a supervisor that did not understand the position he was supervising.
bad,"I worked for Farmers for about 15 years. I absolutely loved my job for about the first 10 years, although it was a very busy environment. The last 5 years got ridiculous. The company at the mid and upper levels of management quit caring about employees. A friend who also worked as a manager applied for a middle level management position and was told basically he needed to be willing to roll heads and fire a lot of people. The manager that got the job was a liar and cheat and began this process, then another manager was brought in from LA and ended up laying off, firing and demoting 1/3 to 1/2 of the entire office of about 50 to 60 employees. I was thankful to be laid off with a severance package (a couple years ago), because many that stayed ended up leaving or retiring to get away from the company after this. I am still in the industry and hear from others that tell about continued nightmares at Farmers and talk about their poor reputation. I have watched Farmer's JD Power rating continue to sink, and it serves them right. They stripped all the best benefits at that time, too. Micromanagement became worse and worse. Most of the profit sharing they had was taken away and the stress level went through the roof. I would not work for them again. The last couple years management did not care about employees. There was one older mid-level manager who was leaving and told me to get out while I could, because the company did not care at all about employees any more. He left a few weeks later."
bad,The management of this company really doesn't know what it is doing. It wants to run every state the same but this really isn't practical. What works in California where they are #1 doesn't always work here in the midwest. The managers are typical for this type of business. They are only out for themselves. If you don't kiss up to them and do things their way then they make your life terible. They tell you that you are running your own business but in reality they control you.
bad,"the company isn't bad the only issue is that main management isn't very supportive. the main way to get ahead is to be licensed, some clients can be difficult but there is little support from corporate for those issues."
bad,"Going into Personal Lines, the leaders talk a lot about how great the company is and how you can make a difference.  When you get done with training, that is where the fantasy they painted starts change.  It's like going in and finding out you are being presented a multi-level marketing scheme or time-share offer.  You get suckered in with all the ""great' things they have to offer."
bad,"Hi Pressure sales, insurance rates not competitive with top three competitors. Excessive amount of paper work required to close any deal. If you don’t meet sales numbers on a quarterly basis they push you out."
bad,"I started my job new to the industry. Working two months I had my property and casualty license as well as my life license. During my interview I was told the company would pay for these certifications. They didn't. For the first 6 months it was hourly pay, then I was supposed to receive commission staying in my 7th month. I was never told they don't pay overtime, they don't."
bad,Call center so turnover is high.  Still have to use green screens to process most of the work.  shift work so if you get a late shift--no time for family.
bad,"Said there would be training for me to come in as a novice....but then there was none available. Setup to fail, in my opinioin."
bad,My department was downsized after Farmers purchased the business I worked for. Highly disappointing that they chose to create a poor performance appraisal rating so that they could justify termination over giving me a lay off package. (I worked in the organization for over 15 years with glowing performance every year.)
bad,"Pros: Opportunity to advance to become insurance agent. Cons: Poor management, inadequate job training, poor compensation and no benefits, low compensation"
bad,"Company has changed their claims handling process so much over the past 10 years in order to meet industry standards for customer service. "
bad,Promised flexibility with coming in to the office/ working from home when I was interviewed and hired.  They tell you everything you want to hear to get you in the door and they are ALL false promises.  No one in a leadership role has any recruiting experience or any idea how to recruit or source.  The formal training is a joke because no one actually knows how to recruit or source.
bad,"Farmers is a massive company, but it is broken up into individual agencies. Your experience with Farmers will depend on your individual agency and agent. My experience was long hours, slightly below-average pay, and no benefits. For the best possible experience, research the agency and ask the agent questions before accepting a position."
bad,"I tried this for about 9 months, went through the training (even paid for it all myself) got licensed and everything and then Farmers just kind of disappeared.  They promise you a lot of support but it never comes to fruition."
bad,"The culture in the workplace at Farmers was abysmal. Attempting creative solutions to common problems was highly discouraged and once management decided you were operating outside of their expected parameters, they would initiate the termination process."
bad,I enjoyed my job but management was a nightmare. They were unfair and if you didn't kiss up to supervisor or manager your life was made very hard. A lot of favoritism. HR did not do anything to help the employees when a complaint was filed.
bad,"Once you get licensed the pressure is on to sell your butt off to even make their stringent requirements to get into the career program. Once you sign the contract the pressure is really on to make their ridiculous quotas. You have a p&c,life,commercial, and securities quota to meet or they take your subsidy away and your left floundering. I had to pay $350 monthly for their worthless agent marketing program that did nothing for me, spent another $1200 monthly to buy outside leads. I worked an average of 63 hours weekly. If you miss a quota you have to make the next months quota plus what you were short the previous month. Was told I would get a $6000 bonus at the end of the career program if I made the securities quotas, they lied, it was part of my subsidy, not a bonus. Hard to maintain a book of business for p&c when Farmers has a rate increase every 3 or 4 months, they can't make up their mind about how to run the actuary risk assessment. Commercial appetite sucks, could only write barber and beauty shops, nothing with a commercial auto. Company is lost, used to be number three, down around 5 now I think, they're a joke. In 2017 Farmers is taking on water, agents selling their agencies left and right, no wonder, company is lost !!"
bad,"The only way to succeed at Farmers is by who you know, not how hard you work, what skills you possess or what you bring to the table.  The only thing that has truly changed in the last 10 years is their commercial. Just ask how employees like working for Claims or Service Ops before buying into the malarkey."
bad,There's no employee protection with this company. They will replace you quickly and find a BS reason to lay you off. Tenure means nothing to the company. I've watched multiple teams and individuals get canned with no logic. Employees were being harassed and HR did nothing about it. Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!
bad,"My experience is like many, which means the company hires large groups to fill positions in a given divisions of the company, with the unspoken expectation to keep one or two from each group hired. "
bad,"The fact that years after I worked for them, I was still receiving letters regarding class action lawsuit settlements should really be all that you should need to know about working for Farmers. Overworked. Underappreciated. Not paid enough for the hardships."
bad,The typical work day is hectic and chaotic. I learned the insurance industry from top to bottom. Management made promises that they fail to deliver on. Work culture was extremely poor. The entire job was more difficult than it had to be. The people that I worked with.
bad,"Management and work culture is horrible. You will only move ahead if you have a good manager, otherwise you are SOL. Some areas such as Liability claims expect you to do OT but you are not paid for it."
bad,"Farmers doesn't understand the difference between good change and bad change.  They are constantly spending profits on failing ideas while leadership sets blame on employees at lower salary grades.  This effects your income and benefits, but generally entry level perks are decent.  The company's hiring boom 3-6 years ago halted any hopes of promotion after positions were set and they've demoted more supervisors than I've seen them promote since that time.  However, job security is there for lower level employees as we are always extremely busy.  The culture varies from each department, but chances are you will work under someone who makes you treat customers unfairly unless they argue enough and request to speak with management.  Since I've worked here the workload has been well beyond our capacity to handle and for 6 years they've told us it will get better and it hasn't.  I left a management position at a smaller operation to work for Farmers because of the opportunity was supposed to be greater for advancement and that has proven to be a great mistake on my part.  Good thing you are reading reviews before making the same mistake."
bad,"The health insurance is really poor, and any complaints to HR are taken at face value, despite proof.  Some good coworkers, but due to stats, others looking to just get ahead, no matter how."
bad,Shady business practices. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap! Call centers micromanaged. Professionals poorly treated. They employ the buddy system for advancement. Worse place I have ever worked. Company creates an unnecessary stressful work environment.
bad,"I've worked here for 5 months, and I can't say there's very much I enjoy about this job. Maybe its my particular office, but it's horrible."
bad,"A typical day at work included answering and making lots of cold calls and brainstorming trying to expand business. I did learn lots of marketing tactics and new ways of using social media for marketing purposes. Management was very pressuring, lots of micro-managing. No coworkers."
bad,Creating trust and long lasting relationships with business owners and individuals in your community.
bad,Constantly micromanaged. Always throw empty promises of promotions and never deliver on them. Pay is 25% below market value.
bad,"You take out a loan from Farmers to set up your 'own agency' but the reality is that they still call all of the shots and, worse, three unexpected premium hikes in less than six months makes it IMPOSSIBLE to sell the product! During my 10 years working in the insurance industry for other major insurance companies, I have NEVER had that happen before! Farmers felt like a pyramid scheme; agents end up leaving as quickly as they can hire new ones (1 year later, only two remain from my class of 40). Why does this structure work for them, you ask? Well, because you're selling their product on your own dime! When it becomes clear that you're not going to be able to keep your head above water, you end up jumping ship and have to deplete your savings paying them back, which is a huge insult to injury. New agents BEWARE! They set you up to fail. Ever wonder why they have so many postings for new agents on job sites? ??"
bad,I have been with Farmers over a year in the GR campus! I can tell you that I have started to look for new job. The place is just horrible and extremely unprofessional. Managament is horrible and quite disrespectful. They have their favorites on the floor that can pretty much get away with alot of stuff. Mangers and supervisors do not take responsibility when insurers or callers request to speak with them. I have to email them to get back back to them and then they take over a week to respond back..
bad,I have had a couple situations where I have felt profoundly discriminated against because of my financial situation and my family situation. Management and the FARMERS family fund seem disconnected and caring and unkind.
bad,They hire a bunch of people at the same time knowing only 1 or 2 will succeed total waste of time they give you no help other than training on their products but no guidance otherwise
bad,Management is quick to tell you what you are doing wrong and or not to their liking however they spend no time teaching you or instructing you on what they really want. They expect you to figure it out on your own. There is a fair amount of training however you are not allowed to study after or before work. Everything is electronic there are no books to study from and all of your computer time is monitored.
bad,"If you want to come home every night and Feel mentally exhausted because of how stressful and busy this job is, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you want to be glued to your desk because you don’t have time to use the restroom, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you want to be treated poorly by agents and then saying you’re a terrible person and Telling you you’re not smart enough, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. Seriously though, save yourself, work for a company who actually cares about their employees, and in case of bad weather, closed their building instead of keeping them open and if you can’t come in you have to use your PTO"
bad,This job is not one that you would want for the long term.  There is a lot of corporate nonsense and rated on criteria you cannot control. Cubicle life is not for me!
bad,"Technology is way behind they still use DOS."
bad,"Do not apply.  Worse management I have ever worked for.  HR is a total joke. Gaslighting is an everyday practice.  They do not value their employees, at all."
bad,They need to get ride of the manager there. Upper management speaking Ill of other employees to other employees! The list can go & on! Cannot wait to leave
bad,"They will bring you on board, promise the sun and stars... once your natural market dries up they will boot you out the door... thanks for building our market share... ok bye now!"
bad,"Long story short: don't do it unless you don't mind being $30,000 in debt with Farmers that you have to owe back. Fraudulent customers, some help sometimes."
bad,"If you like insurance, and are good at selling, you will probably do well here.  The environment can be toxic, though, so you'd better have thick skin."
bad,"I work in the claims department.  I do not have experience with the other departments, they might be better.  To be given too much work and then be told that you're incompetent when you're not able to complete it, does not lead to a healthy work environment  Every week somebody either gets fired because they can't meet the goals (of which there are many) or quits because they are about to get fired.   The place is toxic."
bad,Not a fun place to work as I felt like I was always looking over my shoulder for the pink slip.  This process is still continuing two years later.  Not the company if you are looking for a long-time career.
bad,The management of this company does not care about their employees.  All positions are overworked and there is no consistency in any area of the company.
bad,"After the initial phase of training, management fell short of continued training by giving quick and rushed answers.  This left me with more questions.  I felt the support structure was lacking."
bad,"I worked for Farmers for 40 years.  The last 12 years were awful.  Management was very unfair.  All Farmers wanted to do was promote college over experience and then expected those with years and years of experience to support those that they promoted based on college.  It became a ""lets play a game"" company to keep every one happy when what we really wanted to do was work.  There was no recognition for a job well done, it was always, you could have done more or better."
bad,"Must review client files, up sell coverage or policy to eligible clients, Answer all calls and direct to appropriate departments. Mail merge of all correspondence such as notice to increase rates, discounts available, past due bills, acknowledgement of client claims. Telemarketing for new client.  Market management to best utilize spending for advertising and client acquisition."
bad,"Be abide by the rule and regulation of the company"
bad,"I wish I could say that I had a positive experience with Farmers, but that would be a half truth. This is a sales organization and that is the one thing they did well, I did learn how to sale there. The problem was everything else. The company over promises and under delivers. They promise that you can have a business that you grow at your own pace based on your goals and the limits to your personal finance. This is not true, they demand quotas and threaten your lively-hood if you do not meet them. They require a huge investment of money and time, but do not support their agents properly. Their business model appears to be recruit at a high level, allow the new recruit to bring in all his/her friends, family and associates if he/she makes the quotas fine, if not force them out and turn their book of business over to an agent who is bigger and more established."
bad,"After 26.5 years, the last words I was told was ""We have to let you go."""
bad,"Farmers has little to no financial reporting throughout the company so it instead measures your ""behaviors"" as compared to your peers which is a glorified popularity contest. Don't ever offer a creative idea or suggestion that is different from your boss or else you will be run out of the company."
bad,"If you put family first, and value yourself more than the company, don't even bother!"
bad,The pay was pretty good. However:
bad,I started a Farmers business when you couldn't sell a homeowners policy to anyone. If you like starving to death start a Farmers Agency! I hope Farmers Insurance Group has changed their tunes in the last few years. They require a year of their schools before you can even begin to start an agency. Hope you got a year to starve to death or pay coming in from somewhere else. Good luck!
bad,I worked in agent support and it was awful we would have agents call and curse at us and yell at us for mistakes made on there end by there staff.
bad,"Backstabbing . No teamwork culture."
bad,"No work life balance - typically working 50-60 hours per week.  Poor management and a lack of clarity or where the company is going.  The company is not growing, so that impacts the corporate culture."
bad,"I would say that as a whole, Farmers tries to do the right thing for its customers.  However, it's employees are expendable.  They say go ahead and make mistakes, but will performance manage you out quickly when you make one.  Once they don't like you, they will work fast to get rid of you.  The upper management does not favor the employees, especially in Service Operations.  The customer is always right, no matter how hard the employee follows the guidelines the company sets.  The guidelines go out the window when a customer or agent pushes back. And a lot of what they do is regulated!  When a Farmers agent calls in, they are abusive and rude to the reps, but management doesn't care.  Upper management will do nothing to protect their employees from the agents.  I had high hopes to be with the company for a while, but they showed they are not loyal to its employees.  Phoenix attrition is the worst in all the company sites, and for good reason."
bad,"Everyone seems to have a target on their back. They are starting to outsource a lot. Find something else. Leadership is horrendous, and only sees people as a number."
bad,"They expect WAY too much!!! "
bad,The work culture at Farmer's is very stressful.  The on-boarding to work at Farmer's should be at least 2 years due to the type of information and experience an individual will need to be successful with the job requirements.
bad,I was number 7 to leave our department of eight people in a 1-year period. The new manager of the  department is who drove everybody away. Human resources and ethics departments were aware of the issues and it took them a year-and-a-half to remove him. The company lost a lot of tenure and experience during this time.
bad,As a senior adjuster I have overcome the poor management but it'll hurt your personal life. Too much work and not properly staffed. Typical day consist of sitting at your desk for 8+ hours and not moving. Management says one thing and does another often with zero clarity or openness. The best part is your sinking with a lot of other great employees who eventually leave for better pastures. Tenure is about 2 years before you're burnt out.
bad,"I worked for this company for 26 years and dedicated half of my life to this company and they did nothing for me. When you are older and working for them, they push you out because they know they can pay someone half your age much less. They make you sign a waver every year saying that they can fire you at any time without reason. I would not recommend anyone to work here. They do no appreciate their employees and you are just a number to them. The reasons they gave for firing me do not make any sense and they do not explain anything I am doing wrong. They are not good people and not  a good company to work for and grow your career."
bad,You are an independent agent/producer with restrictions on what/when/where/and how you conduct business. I could not have an office in my house and could not afford to rent space from them or rent my own office space.  Constantly was asked what problems I was having and what they could do to help but no help or suggestions came. If you don't produce (bring them customers) your right to conduct business thru them is revolked.
bad,"racism and group ism is high in certain locations like Caledonia branch...this needs to improve...since this is a small location, there is so much group ism and racist attitude towards people from other countries"
bad,Management says one thing but operates in an opposite manner. If you like being treated like a child and need constant supervision this is the place for you.
bad,"The only company I've ever worked for where top performers are made to feel average. Constantly Micro- Managed and you never felt like your job was safe. If you are not willing to give your all everyday, you wont stand a chance. Lots of favoritism and office politics as well."
bad,"love my job and position held, but the agency owner was not willing to teach me anything or help me learn the daily operations and was always yelling and making threats to me and the other employee"
bad,"he told me he was firing me because i had a learning disability."
bad,"Started out a good place to work, I loved it for 12 years.  Before I left it was almost impossible to keep up with their demands and they seem to have lost all compassion for their employees. You kind of feel like they treat you only by what your progress and numbers are. It was a demanding job, which I really loved for so many years, but they made so many changes that took the local and compassionate customer service out of the company."
bad,High turnover rate. Unfriendly people and unskilled management.  If that is what you are looking for then you are in luck.
bad,"I was working at Farmers Insurance as a temporary employee.  I was there for almost 5 months before I got fired for something that I didn't even do.  I was never given a chance to defend myself, my boss at work didn't say a word to me about it and all of the employees in the department turned on me for something I supposedly did.  As far as job related, if you can stay on everyone's good side, it's a great place to work.  The managers are extremely laid back and hands off, until you screw up."
bad,"This was a terrible job fit for me. When I was hired I was told I would be processing requests/underwriting for half the day and on the phones assisting agents with underwriting questions for the other half of the day. I was told about some great benefits that made me feel privileged to be offered the job. Once I started I found out those benefits were being discontinued and that the hiring manager (and everyone else) knew that. After training I was still being told half the day would be spent off phones but that as new employees we needed to be on all day to learn, for our own benefit. Fast forward 4 years later and I am still on the phones 95% of the time and the place is a call center. When I was hired I told the hiring manager that I am better at processing items than at providing assistance over the phone. I also advised that if there focus was quantity I wouldn't be a good fit but if they valued quality I would be great. They said that is what they were looking for. Those are straight out lies. We get micromanaged and rated on EVERYTHING. My accuracy, judgement, and customer satisfaction are near 100% and higher than company goals but I get knocked every single time because it takes me slightly longer to finish something. I was specifically told by a supervisor ""Go faster. Not everything has to be right."" I hated this response because agents and insureds are depending on me for correct assistance. Just because the company goal says its okay to get 15% of your work wrong doesn't mean I want to embrace that."
bad,Dedicated and hard working people don't matter anymore to Farmers like it did several years ago.
bad,"I can't recommend Farmers as a business platform.  Work for an agent for a year, learn, and then open an independent agency.  Much smarter, long-term."
bad,I was hired as a customer service rep but quickly was pushed to selling. There was no training besides watching some videos. Don't work here if you are not into selling. The cold calls were an especially uncomfortable experience which if I knew I was going to have to do that I would have never applied in the first place. I only lasted two months before I quit. Sales is not for me!
bad,"If you're part of the lgbt community prepare for a storm of hypocritical online posts about how lgbt friendly the company is. when in reality the management and the culture is transphobic and homophobic with splattering of racism. When I complained of transphobic remarks made to me by a coworker, I was reprimanded for telling the coworker what they said was transphobic."
bad,"The supervisors care less than half of the time, and the childish and immature atmosphere is extremely uncomfortable.  The one way to move up is if a close family member works there.  The calls coming in are constant, which is a good thing, but the fact that the agents and the other departments don't know what is really going on, that makes the job chaotic and hard to deal with."
bad,"Nice benefits, upstanding company.  TERRIBLE local management. Very fake culture, the only way to move up is to stab other people in the back.  Incompetency is frequently rewarded rather than hard work."
bad,"Denver office management is terrible. Nationally, the company has moved away from valuing working. Not a place to work in my opinion."
bad,Don't EVER get sick while employed here or you will soon be unemployed. Reason does not matter. I have never seen some many cubes in one location.
bad,"Didn't like the Producer part of insurance feel in love with workers comp. Wanted me to buy a existing agency, didn't have the money to purchase one so I move on to a part of insurance that really fits for me."
bad,"Spent all my savings and worked myself to the bone to build an agency. After many years, employees, and office, still not making any more money than my previous job. There are lots of promises, they expect you to do all the investing and risk. They give you a tiny subsidy to start out, which you have to start paying back at year 3, then if you leave, your stuck owing them thousands. It's a pit."
bad,"Manager was terrible and did alot of micromanaging,"
bad,Difficult to start if you don't have much to rely on early.  It is 100% commission so making making ends meet was nearly impossible if you did not have a financial safety net.
bad,A company that will reward you assuming daily focus and clear goals on your part.    Property/Causalty business is thriving. A smart play to choose a strong company.
bad,"The pay and benefits were pretty good, but the Office Claims Representative job I had was miserable and stressful. My job was to determine liability in non-injury auto accidents, which in and of itself is kind of a cool thing to do all day. You call the people who have accidents and determine who was at fault. The problem was that they couldn't get enough people to work in the department because the management style was just bad. Everyone got buried in claims and the management just called it a sink or swim job and watched the claims department fail. It blew my mind at the time because my job was to determine who was at fault in auto accidents and pay out damages. It was the front line for the entire business, right where the rubber meets the road, and management just said sink or swim and shrugged off the fact the whole office was sinking and the customers were suffering for it. I would not recommend buying insurance from them much less working in their claims department."
bad,"•	Manage independent insurance office."
bad,"Depending on if you enjoy the call center atmosphere, it is very micro-managed. You clock in and out to go to the rest room, you are taken into a little room once a week for a half hour and they listen to a phone call you have received. You never have great calls because than It would not be a learning experience. You are to explain to agents and district managers in 8 minutes or less their answer, it sounds like a lot, but it's not. You will not receive advancement or salary increases if you can not pull this off, some underwriters would just hang up causing the agent or DM's to call back in. Your supervisor's salary increases are based on their groups over all performance, so several supervisor's are degrading and insulting if you are not performing as needed for their job performance review. Horrible job."
bad,District Managers get paid to recruit and see who makes it rather than investing the time needed to effective train new agents in the field of insurance. They'll hire anyone that qualifies (which may not be the best thing for the hiree) and you're on your own after that. I saw VERY good people chewed up because they didn't have a good district manager involved.
bad,A very oppressive environment with great retire benefits.
bad,"The team is not cohesive,’ losers of staff turn over which lacks room for proper training and advance.   Not a place for back employees.   They only hire white and Asian"
bad,"The workload is impossible to manage.  Employees are given 15 to 20 claims per day to work and asked to provide exceptional customer service.  With such a heavy workload, it is impossible to provide quality service."
bad,"Coach, mentor and advise insurance agents to implement new company distribution system to promote agency grow and increase profitability."
bad,"Was only there a couple months. Not a great fit for me. Other people there really like it though. "
bad,"This was a very stressful environment.  I felt like a robot working here.  There were good amenities in the building, however.  Just not right for me, but many other people were happy there.  Just a personal choice."
bad,I love the agents I work for. However job advancement is very limited and very competitive. No health benifits since I work for individual agents and I am considered to be an independent contractor.
bad,"Why do I have to write a review for this place it is awful an they treat their emploees like trash...I would NEVER tell anyone to work there, it is not a fun place"
bad,"If you can find a job doing something else do it. This is a call center, not much more than that. Advancement is non"
bad,Manager called me while on vacation to tell me they were laying me off.  This was right after I took test and passed to become assistant to the supervisor.  Had no college.  Everybody else who took test and did not pass all had college degrees but I was the only one who passed the test.  Everyone was scratching their heads wondering why they did not pass and i did.  I advised them if they would have read the question correctly they would have answered the question correctly!!!!
bad,"If you want a job here, move to phoenix as they are closing down most of the jobs in kansas.  They mostly promote box checkers and yes men.  If you question things, you are seen as a detractor."
bad,Micro management environment. Of you're okay with that. I was not. They seemed to only focus in me and everytime I was sick or missed a day I was called into a conference room to explain why. It was ridiculous. Could not change supervisor or working hours.
bad,I came to Farmers without knowing any systems solely for Farmers. I have been an insurance agent for many years and my expertise with regards to compliance and knowledge was not the issue. I received no training even though this was promised to me in the interview. I was made to sink or swim.
bad,"Very stressful work environment. The more work you did the more expectations they had and no recognition for a job well done. It's nice to hear every now and then ""good job""."
bad,Awful place to work at.  No support from sales management.  Misleading information.  Training was not consistent -  you left on your own to figure things out
bad,"Don't work as an independent contractor. You invest a lot for too little. As independent contractors, you are giving your time away for little commission."
bad,"Farmers is not what it used to be. Management does not care about the employees, everything is very much falling apart and pay is horrible. Great company falling apart."
bad,"Analyzed billing and accounting for Auto /Home policies."
bad,The work environment is very great top work at. Excellent knowledge of products. The company is a very close knit family.
bad,"Poor Management, would not listen or respond when asked how to streamline daily work flow. Would not listed to reason, Unresponsive"
bad,"I was laid off just before a month of being there because there was not enough work, I was told when there was more work i would be called and I never was. a few weeks later someone else had the job."
bad,Would get assigned to a truck. We would load this truck with all the packages until the truck was full. We would have to stack boxes on top of each other and make sure it went all the way to the top of the truck. Packages would weigh anywhere from 0 pounds to 150 pounds.
bad,"I was not prepared to become a used car salesman, this is essentially what this job entailed. I thought I would be helping people identify areas that they could benefit from having insurance,instead I was given quotas to meet and not provided staff to fulfill customer service needs."
bad,"Daily interaction with the agency force and insured's in assisting them with their questions on policies insured with Farmers.  Consistent employee interaction to assist in their development within the current position and their further career aspirations.  "
bad,I've learned some while in this position but ready for far greater things.
bad,This was a new office and it was just me and the owner. I was there for only a short time because of financial reasons. Shortly after I left the office closed.
bad,"I was told I would be paid a stipend when I passed my Series 6 and 63 and was later told that was not correct. I would be paid a small draw and given no leads, have to pay for my space and all office supplies."
bad,Wonderful placed to be employed. I worked with this company which has high rating in ALL of their products.  I would also still be employed but (ALL of the Zurich Insurance  employees) were let go. We were no longer need. After Farmers were able to get how (Zurich  Insurance) process worked on the East Coast.....
bad,Change of phone systems and payment procedures constantly. Very nice agent! but constant change in office so much that procedures were hard to follow.
bad,"I have never been so micromanaged in my life! The pay was by no means a livable wage. Commisions only seen if you exceed 1500mo. Zero leads provided, zero commercial to maintain, Uncomfortable and inappropriate Mgr. I could go on.... Happy to have my P&C license and will use it to the full potential but the Farmers office I was in was honestly a joke! The only thing good about the experience was the underwriter I worked with over the phone and the flexibility to take care of family issues if they arise, however that too came with a very long lecture on how one will never succeed unless they put their job first. I really hope to find a better office atmosphere and opportunity to make a real living."
bad,Boss put me on hold said come back in a few weeks never contacted me again. Dropped off my things and never gave me an answer. Pay was awful no hrs. No stability and not worth working thsre.
bad,They do not give you a opportunity to grow. you get whatever job they give you and that is where you stay at for 5 years before you can move anywhere else.
bad,"From 9:00 am to 11:00am >Attending Seminars, Doing my regular stuff, updating client's profiles, Researching on leads, Making calls, Making appointments to meet clients."
bad,"We sell insurance to consumers but we are left without any Health, Vision, or Dental, or Life insurance for ourselves or our families. It is a out for yourself environment not a team atmosphere at all."
bad,They are constanly changing their products and rates which makes it hard to retain business.  District manager goes behind your back and shows favor to certain agents.  I would not recommend.
bad,"Farmers was a good way to get into the claims industry. It is very difficult to promote at Farmers and they require a lot of training for advancement; unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain the training."
bad,"I learned to not try to do anything extra, except when the manager expected that you should do something extra, unless you have to ask what they want you to do, then that is too much. I also learned that cursing from one office to the other in front of customers was okay so long as you felt you were in the right, or the other wasn't right, or maybe they were, doesn't really matter."
bad,"Mr. Borghesi was demanding and unappreciative. He always had something negative to say about anyone but himself. He has a problem with pain meds and gets angry and yells when he's coming down from them."
bad,There are no benefits and there is no room for advancement at the Agency level unless you are the Agency Owner. I am sure Corporate jobs are different. Ask yourself what your goals are and whether a job in an independently owned (most likely small) Agency will help or hinder you meeting those goals.
bad,Working for the agent I worked for it was not a great experience. Very rude and lack of respect for female employees. I would recommend the call center but not a certain agent's office.
bad,Pay was very low given expectation to full-fill all duties including janitorial and agent was gone a good amount of the time.  Agent treated everyone like they were morons.
bad,Worst place to work. You do your job right and still get written up for someone's personal view of you. No diversity in upper management.  You are not valued for your hard work. No work life balance.
bad,Not lot of employees in the office and pay would be late most of the time. Very unorganized company.If need help get hold of anyone.
bad,"Unless you have your heart set on selling insurance and seeking out individuals with perfect credit, no losses, and fear of losing assests you will not succeed. You must also be very well connected with a network that is very supportive of your career choice as you will need to regularly call in favors."
bad,A typical day with FARMERS was coming into the office and being the only one there. The agent was gone every day all day and came in once every other week but would call to complain about the job and say to do one thing and get upset for doing it. Clients would want to talk or meet with him and he was never there and if he had to be there he was mad. It was nice to know that I got good positive reviews and the clients would say that they appreciated that I would call them back and actually be at the office.
bad,"Was not a great place to work at all. Only benefit was having weekends off other then that,it was terrible. Was only part time and pay sucked $10 an hour and $1 for every quote you get. I was calling businesses, lawyers and people at work who did not have time to talk. And if you did get them to give you their info, then you have to tell them the agent will call them back with in the hour. Now who wants to be bothered a second time at work? It's cold calling whole shift. People are not friendly on phone. I got 1 break which I'm supposed be entitled to. My boss complained about me taking that 15 minutes. When he was outside every hour smoking. I found it to be very tedious and tiring sitting there for my whole 5 hour shift. Some days were better then others getting quotes, and if I didn't get a lot that day my boss would complain, but again people do not want to be bothered at work and then called back a second time! Overall job sucked, stuck sitting in a room by myself with no windows and calling people all day.... Boring!!!"
bad,"B O R I N G   cold called clients trying to set up appointments"
bad,Required more than what was physically possible to do.  Then rated you pay on that.
bad,There was little to no training.  I was expected to know things that were not noted in computer or that I had been shown once.  My  manager was constantly late in the morning and took extra long lunches and owner was hardly ever there.
bad,"When I was recruited, I was led to believe that Farmers respected its agents. On the contrary, every bone is slowly retracted."
bad,"I worked there for approx 5 years. If you are just out of college, it is decent pay and a good start for most people who could not get another job. But the management was shady and all about making their numbers look good... even if they weren't, which lead to dishonesty of reps, supervisors and mgmnt. There was no work life balance. Often told to not work past my 40 hrs 'wink wink' - meaning don't claim it but get your work done no matter what. The values and culture were fake. Just a front of sunshiney displays so you feel warm and fuzzy until you see the real truth of how they treat their employees. You are not safe. There is no loyalty between to company and the employee. They have changed their benefits signifigantly since I left and it is a rip-off... setting expectations 99% cannot obtain to get bonus or other compensation. They have to make someone an example for the other employees--- and by example, I mean they will always find someone to make the worst employee to put fear into other reps. I was fortunate, I understood claims, was a, hard worker and left on my own terms, but do not intend to go back... ever."
bad,"Just not a good fit for me, lots of miscommunications . The district manger would arrive at noon have lunch then call meetings at 4:45, when the rest of the office had arrived at 7:30am to the office, then was shocked why everybody was upsets by his almost daily long winded meetings."
bad,Worked 60-70 hours per week
bad,"Tough to exist in sales, when the company you represent is always trying to sell to you. Used new agents to gain new accounts from their family and friends. Selling is difficult, but when a policy is sold and the company rejects it, because the risk is not enough in their favor it is demoralizing. I hated going back to the customer, after I sold the policy, only to tell them that the company was rejecting coverage. I worked for two months on a business policy only to have the insurance company refuse to even provide a quote. I learned allot from insurance sales. The insurance company gets all the glory and profit and the agent gets all of the pain and takes all of the risk. Commission only works for the insurance company. The insurance company does not pay a single cent for the hours their agents work trying to gain the sales.I realize that there are very successful insurance agents, but no matter how well they are doing, the insurance company is profiting more from their effort than the agent is. Insurance sales simply was not for me. Was constantly pressured to sell more insurance than the customer wanted or could afford and to sell multiple policies (bundling) even though the customer did not ask for it or wanted the additional quotes or to be pressure sold. Morality and insurance sales are not compatable. It was my first and last insurance sales job. The subsidy is just a set-up for this insurance company. It traps agents into debt and the company states that the agent is an independent agent, but the agent most certainly feels like an employee."
bad,The leadership is more interested in the latest technology to reduce employees instead of focusing on employees.  The company does not have any direction which starts from the top down.
bad,"Company has some strength in the market but prices are too high and keep going up and not enough support to Agencies which they really hold to being 1099"
bad,"I am ethical above all.  The insurance business isn't all that variable, but ethics can be.  I stuck to doing what was best for my customers and not my bottom line.  That isn't a good combination for selling for one of the more expensive companies out there."
bad,Farmers is slashing budgets in the field claims department.  All resources are going to inside claims adjsuters and the the Cat team.  I assume field staff will be cut in the coming years.
bad,Business practices and systems are not aligned to obtain the growth the management team demands. Poor practices cause continual customer complaints and create constant fire fighting.
bad,"The culture there was that employees are expendable. The IT group simply wanted contract staff to limit the cost and offer no benefits. They never offer their contracts employees full time slots, just cycled them in and out."
bad,"No professionalism, the guys who worked next door were so unprofessional and perverts. They expected you to know what to do before actually teaching you so you learned as you went."
bad,Farmers is a company that is horribly managed with a lack of understanding on how to run their operation with efficiency.  Their inability to develop efficient claims software and systems limits any potential for growth.
bad,"I would never work for Farmers Insurance again if my life depended on it. It was an abolute hole of favoritism, office gossip, and junior high level drama."
bad,"-Extreme cold calling, with minimum warm leads."
bad,"The company is stuck in the old boys club traditional mindset, to keep up with competition it needs to update its technology as well as develop new rewards and commission models for agents.  Currently it delegates all expenses including office and staffing for just 10% commission in auto and 15% for rest, way too low at least for Bay Area living standard."
bad,"Unstable work, layoff's, Hardly any benefits offered. Stressful, extremely busy and demanding. Not much of a chance for advancement. Dealing with angry customers. Most positions are commission based with sales goals."
bad,the training was not very good and agents are expected to start building a book of business with very little training.  The quotas were very unreasonable and stressful to meet.
bad,"To be successful you must work extremely long hours. Not recommended for persons with a family."
bad,"You sit at a desk for 8 hours dealing with really stressful calls and  high call volume. The company itself tries to convey a feeling of family and inclusion.  It is the direct management however, that does not implement this. This job is not for people who do not like to be micromanaged, any supervisor can and will watch your every move; some abuse this power. All departments are understaffed and therefore overworked. The only people i heard say liked their position were people in management. This office had the lowest score out of the whole company regarding whether or not the employees were happy to work there. They offer a lot of benefits but their health insurance isnt great, mostly high deductible plans."
bad,"Overall culture was good. But there were no benefits or advancements. My time at Farmers has been a great one, my boss is great and we work well together. The downside is that there are no benefits or advancements in this position."
bad,"Like many employers, onboarding applies to new employees only rather than long-term employees.  This includes employees that are attempting to transition from one department to another.  There is no support or coaching for transferring employees.  If you want to stick to the designated ""career path"" and only follow the steps outlined by your supervisor, you may keep your job.  If you try to forge your own path, you will not receive any support."
bad,"Farmers is in a great location from my home. I always find myself rushing on my breaks, and lunch, I feel like I am being watched when I get out of my seat and it is not beak time or lunch."
bad,The management was really bad. Co workers were not happy. I like to work in a enviroment were there is a motivation enviroment.
bad,"From recruitment to hire date to the time you're swept out the door you'll feel like a transaction has taken place. For those who are naturally inclined to be successful at sales, you will probably find Farmers to be a good place to work. Those people generally are successful wherever they go. For those who really have to work to be successful at sales, you will likely find that Farmers support staff does very little. Perhaps I just had a bad experience, but I have a hard time believing that my experience was unique."
bad,when you work for Farmers District offices you are actually working for an Independent business owner that is not an employee of Farmers. They do not tell you this until after your first day. Many things were told to me in regards to this position that were not true.
bad,"I was able to sharpen my selling skills and management abilities."
bad,"They look at numbers only. They want you to answer the phone. They could care less about the quality of the call. Hold times are ridiculous simply because they will not hire enough people. For the knowledge one needs to know, the salary is insulting. Management is invisible. They pile everything on their leads, who really aren't leads. The current ""person in charge"" comes from the Verizon Call Center. How do cell phones and life insurance remotely even begin to sound the same as far as success? They don't. If you are in Ohio, don't expect to advance to anything but a higher troll in the Contact Center. The agents aren't happy. The customers aren't happy. It's a very unhappy environment and as with most companies today, nobody is listening and nobody cares.The company is well on it's way to crashing and burning."
bad,Due to personal conflict I would prefer to discuss my experience with this company in person if pertaining to a career opportunity.
bad,A person is on there own when starting.  Need large savings account to invest in business.
bad,"I joined Farmers as an experienced agent, There was very little assistance in getting acclimate to their system and processes. Basically, they promised lots but delivered very little. I ended up spending more that I earned and invested more into the basic items that were promised to be provided."
bad,"Just an overall horrible experience. You have quarterly goals which is fine, but when I was trending down I asked 2 different sales managers and our marketing manager, who was useless, about doing a few marketing ideas and was told no, keep doing what you're doing, it will come together. After I missed my goals for the quarter I was terminated and now am $40,000 in debt to Farmers. Terrible leadership from top to bottom. They hired me with zero insurance experience and did a fair job on training us on the product, but there was no useful information on gaining new clients. If you have insurance experience and are a proven salesman, this may work for you, but if you have no sales experience I would advise against getting into this. They will tell you that you are a small business owner, but that only means you pay for everything, but you still have to answer to them, so it is really just a job with a terrible pay rate. "
bad,"You are always on the hunt for quotes, people to sell to, and those people are your income if they say ""yes."" For the most part, you know people because you want to sell to them, not a great thing to network. Also, stability is like a roller coaster, never know when you be looking for another job; just a job without the pay."
bad,Typical day was on the phone calling leads. Going out canvassing neighborhoods and businesses attempting to market and generate business. Management is lacking in direction. The hardest thing to deal with is the deceptive practices they use. Would not take the position twice
bad,"Not really much to say, other than I hated it. I did not like dealing with customers who's family that had just passed and trying to get their insurance and everything settled. Very sad."
bad,"Get to work check calls. Start calling back the customers, first all the important calls then down the list."
bad,The work environment here was totally unprofessional.  The immediate supervisors were clearly clueless on what to do and how to manage people on the job.
bad,Get paid on commission with a slim possibility of bonuses and other rewards such as semi paid for trips.  Residual income with the never relenting pressure to sell your clients more.
bad,"The company is not for everyone, there commission schedule is poor, and they provide very little training to new agents. Do your research, before you look into being agency owner or purchasing a agency. In my opinion there are better companies, including insurance companies to own and invest your hard earned money in."
bad,"There were no benefits offered. Not enough hours. I did like the flexibility if a personal situation arose. It was a small office with a handful of people, which I did like."
bad,"Management and workplace culture were demanding and terrible; compensation was poor and inadequate; no potential for advancement; no paid holidays, vacations or sick time; and no medical insurance."
bad,Deal with complaints from customers constantly because of rates/rate increases. Pressure to sell sell sell. Some Agents treat their staff poorly but yet expect staff to successfully operate their business as if it was their own.
bad,"The company was great at first but then they started to go down hill. The management doesn't care if you get cussed out (which happens more then it should). You are also required to handle multiple transaction at a time and if you complain about it, you get written up. You can not vent to other employees about the conditions without the management getting butthurt. If you have to use PTO for a sick child you get written up. I do not recommend working here if you do not enjoy being stressed on a daily basis."
bad,The upper management are phony. They talk like they care about the people that work for them but that is truly not the case.  I was in middle management and seen this first hand.  They say they are not focused on numbers but the behavior and this is not the case.  They confuse their employee on what they want and hold them accountable.  They want you to give their customers a great experience and you are dealing with several types of insurance policies sometimes on the same call however they still expect a low number for their call times.  Want you to give great service but still rush them off of the phones.  Farmers does not know how to run a call center.  They care more about their Agents which are contractors than they do about their own employees.  Their Agents call in very arrogantly and speak down to the representatives.  The company does nothing to correct this and allow their agents to dictate how they opperate their business.
bad,"hiring only trainees with consist turnover (hired 78 trainee adjusters in 1 year) from the Dallas office only."
bad,"Most management figures are two-faced and wouldn't hesitate to throw you under the bus. There are a few genuine supervisors and managers but few and far between. Don't be fake with us, we all see it. Pay us comparable to the industry standard, we are considerably underpaid which is causing you to lose good employees as other insurance companies in the area appreciate employees and the stress that comes with the job. Finally, we are in customer service but most times it feels we are pressured to cut this or that causing customer frustration instead of doing what is right. That would not only retain current customers but entice others to consider us. To confirm employees, former and current, and also customers are frustrated with Farmers policies, Google search Farmers Insurance lawsuits. When your own employees sue you multiple times you might consider being more ethical with everyone, employees and customers."
bad,"the manager hired me as a customer service representative and had me doing agent tasks, he was hardly in the office and did not train me prior to working and would get mad when i made a mistake instead on teaching me."
bad,"The company overlooks their frontline employees, and adheres more to a call center vibe, rather than a customer focus.  Front line employees continually engage in mandatory shift bids, and Holiday bids.  Communication between management and Frontline employees was lacking."
bad,mostly answered the phones and a couple of little errands for the boss that i was working for at the time of employment. Helped people that called in understand what farmers insurance was and how we could offer them a better deal then all other insurance companies
bad,"Love interacting with my co workers and agents. "
bad,Very difficult industry with little support from management.  Limited training and lots of pressure to make quotas.  Long hours with little pay.  No life work balance.
bad,"I worked as a reserve Agent in training, no training pay. Farmers was an ok place to work, I did a lot of research on  Farmers history and how farmers does business."
bad,Management does not communicate to all employees and he/she is unavailable to help guide or find a resolution to current problems. Fails to respond in a timely manner. Cross distant relationships interfere with operational tasks and favoritism is displayed often.  Voluntary leave or lay offs are random and often.
bad,Insurance industry changing to online sellers and local store fronts. Insurance agent commissions are being squeezed to nothing. Companies compete against their own agents.
bad,If you are looking for a long term career do not look at Farmers.  This company has a lot of turnover.  This is why you always see jobs posted for them.
bad,"Answering incoming/outgoing calls.Filing documents, data entry, collecting and calculating checks/money. Opening the establishment and closing. Also Billing"
bad,"The pay is okay, the benefits aren't great and the culture is poor.  If you're lucky you'll get a supportive manager but you'll still struggle with support from anywhere else."
bad,Independent agent recieves no support. Hard to start a business. was promised to be able to write in both OH and PA and was told I wasn't able to.
bad,"The only way to make money is to own your own agency. Working as a producer or anything else is a scam. You will put in long hours travelling everywhere and making cold calls for less that half of the commission on each sale. Good for the agent, but TERRIBLE for anyone else who works within the agency."
bad,Great company to work for if you want to pursue a career in the sales field
bad,The management at the  office wasn't  structured or organized as I expect it to be
bad,"I felt that I wasted my time working here. The people in the office seemed so unhappy. Small office. People can hear your conversations. No privacy. Micro-managed. Management is clueless. A lot of gossiping and whispering going on daily. Workers afraid to stand up for themselves. Don't expect any fun in this place. Work, work, work."
bad,No training provided by the District Office or support associated with programs
bad,"Maintained a litigated and pre-litigated file pending of property/casualty claims for New York and multiple drive-through states including eastern parts of Canada. Regularly utilized a variety of alternate dispute resolution methods and worked closely with defense counsel. Took on additional duties of the triage desk for the NY claims office and handled an additional 55 Legacy file (paper) that were all in suit."
bad,"They don't care about you, your life outside of claims or even your opinions on what claims are worth. When working for Farmers as a claims rep, sure you get a car and a phone and a computer but you are pretty much a slave to the supervisors and managers. If they don't agree with your claim value they change it and then expect you to successfully negotiate something you do not agree with."
bad,"The one positive is that the KS call center will pay over $20 per hour to someone without a college degree.  But then again, those are the only type of people you get to work call centers.  "
bad,"I adjusted and processed hundreds of first- and third-party auto insurance claims. I analyzed and determined liability and validity of claims, which ensured the terms were met within the four corners of the contract."
bad,"Micromanaged and constantly berated by the owner, micromanaged by his office manager. Most coworkers are unfriendly and would rather hide behind a frown than engage in coversation. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the owner/boss. Most enjoyable part of the day is leaving at 5 pm."
bad,Long days of paperwork and lousey computer system input. Wasteful using their programs. They often crash after hours of input and you lose everything. Management is poor with follow up or help. Mostly tracking your numbers is all they concentrate on.
bad,Loved working in the insurance industry. Agent was less desirable to work for.
bad,"Agent I worked for belittle her employees way too much and some costumers as well. I was always thought costumers are always first, she’s a control freak that puts her “rules” before costumers."
bad,"If you ever worked for a Claims Dept for a large Insurance Company, the work here is fairly the same.  Very busy claims business with high expectations."
bad,"There is limited professional growth, and when advancements are considered, they tend to be personal and not merit based. One who has family already working within Farmers is more likely to get promoted over one who does not. There is no work and family balance, and if you have children, it can be difficult to get time approval for doctors' appointments.  They stress not wasting your vacation time as you may need it for doctors' appointment or other family emergencies. However, everyone needs time to decompress, but one has to think twice before using vacation time for that."
bad,You have to be able to work on your own. The people you do help on a daily basis makes it worth it though. Management only concerned about company not people.
bad,"Local agents without a strong corporate base makes for a confusing and frustrating work place. Goals were unclear both locally and from corporate. Training often came after the fact and with an overreaction/backlash. Too many ""wink-wink"" rules and regulations."
bad,"The company is another example of the good ol' boys club in that it comes down to who you know and not what you know, or your skill.  If you do well at your job but do not play the political game, prepare to be stagnant when it comes to growth.  Find a mentor and choose wisely, making sure this person is high up, on a clear upward trajectory, or is tight with the executive level.  Seen way to many stellar employees be looked over for the inexperienced who were tied to a shot-caller, in one way or another, be it family member or colleague from previous employment.  Nepotism is not frowned upon.  While priding itself as a top tier training company, there seems to be times where it misses the mark on internal jobs, focusing more on agents, the lifeblood of the company, despite being independent contractors.  Despite being new to the Northeast, and while some numbers show growth (inevitable when you start from nothing), the big picture shows slower growth than is projected/set as the goal.  Workload is either slow as molasses or unmanageable, no in between.  Also, headcount is always discussed with the moral of the story being, ""we can and will cut your position at the drop of a hat.""  In the end, exciting as a new insurance company in the Northeast but a letdown when it came to the actual state of things."
bad,"Get everything in writing, and I mean everything.  Supervisors and Managers lie directly in the face of contradictory evidence.  Favoritism is out of control.  Pushing back the goalpost has become a primary motivational strategy.  I can not say enough bad things about working for this company"
bad,Farmers is the par for the course when it comes to insurance firms.  They have funny commercials though.  Having connections with upper management is key at this company.
bad,Cut commissions often and don't provide enough mentoring to new agents and not very much support when needed.  They just want worker pumping sales and dont care too much about the service side.
bad,"Farmers allowed managers who only wanted to please other managers.  Many of the ""grassroots"" managers were more interested in pleasing the top management rather than actually spending time managing employees."
bad,"The job itself is ok. Relaxed atmosphere, pay really sucks. I've been with this company for several years no type of benefits what so ever. Its hard to balance work and family due to the schedule. The agent is never at the office, stressful when its busy."
bad,Strong Insurance Company. Strong Insurance competitive. The Company has been in business for a very long time. The insurance business continues to thrive. Insurance is the Company's number one priority.
bad,Farmers insurance company is a great place to work if you are an agent However finding agents to recruit can be challenging. On my tipical day at the office I had to make at least 120 phone calls to potential fit to become a agent with our company.
bad,It was OK even though you get cursed out and hung up on. I just did outbound calls trying to get people to join on getting the insurance. The manager was great I have no issues with him except for not enough hrs and I only got paid 40.00 weekly.
bad,Farmers Insuance was not in a good position while I was employed there. Insurance rates went up. which caused my agency to be in a tough position trying to earn new business. I lost a lot of money by signing on with the Farmers Insurance Group
bad,"This company like to sell agents on the fact you get to be your own agent. You get to own your own book of business. Either are as they seem. I am not aware of other insurance businesses out there, but please make your decision off of what you can see not what your hear."
bad,"Farmers Insurance is only about profitability. Which means that unless your an appointed agent, they don't view you as a valuable employee. The agents might sell the policies but it is their customer service reps that provide the day to day servicing of the accounts. While the agents practice their sales pitch, their CSR's are responsible for all maintenance of the policies, including but not limited to policy reviews, submitting payments, explaining different insurance products, selling additional insurance products, filing, faxing, and maintaining the office integrity. But these tasks are not considered valuable or a necessity to the district and corporate managers with Farmers. Despite working so hard to insure the agency is running efficiently, CSR's do not get paid a fair wage and are encouraged to sale policies in order to try to make more money. When your too busy managing your head agents book of business, it becomes very difficult to put in the required time to meet any sales goal that translates into fair earnings. With the experience and skills that I have and acquired, being paid $9 an hour does not cut for an income for a 31 year woman. I would seriously research the company and agency you want to get a job with before working for Farmers"
bad,"Learn a lot about finance and business as well as finance.  Good place to start if you wanted to go into sales. no real job security, since you are working for your self and completely reliant on sales."
bad,"I have really enjoyed working for Farmers in the past. Unfortunately, the last 2 years have gone downhill. I like all the people I work with, unfortunately I feel the companies upper management has an unrealistic idea of what our job entails and the work that we actually do."
bad,"Taking insurance payments"
bad,"sitting behind a desk every day fixing problems and getting auto quotes and make sales. learned how to work the system and how to understand how to use it. manager is a good person very smart and teaches us what you need to know about the business. like my coworkers  they are very helpful and they explained things in more detail. the hardest part of the job is trying to not to make any mistake, even though there will be a couple of mistake. the most enjoyable part of the job is to not having to work the weekend."
bad,"The people in my district office are great people to work with. Their training is top notch and you get a good grasp of their system before you actually start. The bad news comes after the training. I was being sent to numerous places all over the Bay Area and I was getting calls from clients pretty late at night. You will also have different managers telling you different things and each will get upset if their way is not followed. Overall, I grew unhappy as time went by. The money they promised is your revenue and not your profit. Yes you can make good money, but really all you're gaining is experience."
bad,"Perhaps some have had good experiences working with Farmers Insurance.  For me, I can only comment on the Total Loss Department.  This was a very negative experience."
bad,Farmers has good products but being an Independent agent is tough work!  Long hours making calls daily and you work on commission only.  You have to live at the office to make sales and Farmers does not make it easy since they hire people all the time.  You have to compete against other agents and if you don't keep an eye out they will take sales from you.  Farmers LOANS you money once you make it past all the red tape and if you don't make your goal you have to start paying it back.  Benefits are expensive and competition is fierce from other companies.  IF you decide to try this have a lot of money on hand to spend as you will need it.
bad,Cold calling to produce a client list.  Co-workers was a joy to work with.
bad,"They promise you the moon, but unless you are independently wealthy, and can go for a couple of years without steady income....don't even consider it. "
bad,"Do not get the proper training at all, and be very careful, they lie about all of the goals and advancements and contracts"
bad,"People that you work with on the day to day basics are very nice to work with . If you are not upper management , you are the problem and not them. I would call this company borderline mean and quite underhanded. Instead of letting a person go they demean them and basically wait for you to quit. They is no accountability for management and they do not know how to lead or motivate people to get the best from them. They feel if we mirco management and belittle you then you will do better."
bad,I was promised to learn and grow my insurance agency from the ground up.
bad,"Farmers is set up to be a really great place to work. Unfortunately employees place their experience on who their managers are and the managers are likely the reason Farmers has been sued by its employees so many times. There is very high turnover in this office with the complaint mostly being because of management. Upper management has not taken any steps to resolve this issue. You have to be VERY organized to get your work done in an 8 hour day and even the most seasoned people have issues with this. Your coworkers will keep you there longer than you wanted to be there. There is some flexibility if you are not in personal lines, but this is quickly going by the wayside."
bad,My poor training did not prepare me for the job
bad,"If you enjoy putting in 10-12 hour days and high stress environments, it can be a fantastic career. Since I enjoy neither, this position was essentially the worst possible fit for me."
bad,This company gave me additional experience as a independent worker and agency owner  I developed skills where I had to be creative to cross sell and asist the client to see the value of insurance.
bad,"Too long of hours"
bad,"When you get hired at Farmers you're told itll be like family and to work life balance is exceptional. Dont expect that to last too long. Once you're on full production of claims you wont o ly ne expected to do your 40 hours of claims but also anyone else that is behind. They put a very large emphasis on customer service but dont provide resources to hit those metrics and threaten your career at every turn in attempt to ""bring out the nest""."
bad,"I don't want to say a bunch of negative things and each situation is subjective. But know what you are getting into. Be prepared to make life insurance salea a top priority or you will quickly become under valued. If you think good sales & customer service is enough, think again."
bad,"lots of calls and followups. Rewarding when it comes to closing sales and meeting the quota. oversee projects and production schedules. researched coverage and premium options and supplied clients with the best coverage available. compared insurance policies, proved quick turnaround time when customers called with question immediate. helped banks and mortgages obtain proof of insurance in a timely manner."
bad,"Management never worked with me when I had several ideas on how to lower call volume. I also gave other ideas on communicating with our end users to make their job easier and to lower call volume. Managers just said these ideas couldn't be done and never looked into them. This department needs a team atmosphere not the ""me"" atmosphere like it is now."
bad,"Be prepared to hit the ground running, prospecting, studying product's and pay for the CDI State License Testing. This includes registering your license, given you pass the exam, and don't forget the finger prints. Then be prepared to clear your calendar and fill it with your prospects, write policies, and cross selling for MORE!"
bad,"I am not sure if all Farmers Insurance office was like the one I worked at, but I would never recommend working for the office I worked at in Laurel. The office is closed now, but the management was never there, he paid below minimum wage and sometimes would intentionally not show up to the office on pay day to not give you your salary. the upside was that it was a quiet working environment. After I quit, he shut down the business and open in a different location."
bad,good experience but not good support.  not going to recommend this experience to someone else though.  the insurance market is tough so be sure you do your research on the company you want to work with.
bad,"I currently work here so I am not going to say anything about this specific branch of farmers but I will not recommend it, that is all. I don't not have anything more to say at thing time."
bad,I learned a lot from working here but at the end of the day it is not the job for me as far as a career job. Very poor pay and benefits so I wouldnt want to continue with working here.
bad,I was hired at Farmers to be a life and health agent. The P&C agents were supposed to give me leads to work. That never happened. I had to scramble for leads. I sold one policy in six months.
bad,"Let me start off by saying that Farmers is basically a good and decent company.  Unfortunately, the company does not hire competent managers. "
bad,"•	Provided support and service for policyholders "
bad,"The office is nice, but it is phone-based work, and the callers on the other end are not usually nice. It is stressful, there is little room for advancement, and your performance is based on some very silly standards, such as call length."
bad,this isn't a job for someone who wants to move up because you work for someone else who does less work and you do more work. maybe one day you can open your own farmers but the trainings not there
bad,Although my experience while at Farmers began well it did not end up well.  Had a difference of opinion about the work I produced after experiencing a wholesale change when department managers up and left.  I do feel that I was given a chance to learn new skills when I accepted the job and found those skills to be transferable to today and what I do.
bad,"Company all about agent growth. If hired on the agent support side, however, it's all about which district manager hires you. That is what will make or break the Farmers' experience since DM's are independent contractors. On the agent support side (consultants, assistant managers, recruiters/trainers, etc.), employee cultivation and career development was nonexistent. Still enjoyed working with individual agents. Lackluster management and assistance from corporate office. No benefits, whatsoever. Salary job (or hourly) and that is it. No such thing as a raise. Disconnect between corporate ops and ops at state level. Suggestions to improve processes mean little. Heard superiors describe corporate as the ""good ole boys"" having their ""dog and pony shows."" Unfortunate lack of diversity. Over 75% of management are white males (2015 statistic). Little accountability. Enjoyed the handful of people I worked with at the district office, though. Would not recommend the company to anyone - whether you're looking for a career or even an insurance customer. Left with a bad taste."
bad,"unless you have the ability to buy a really quality book of business from an existing agent, starting out as a scratch agent is just not the position you want to put yourself in"
bad,"Very command and control style of management. They like to promote the ability to run your own team, but do not give you the tools, support, or ability to do this."
bad,Great company with lots of potential if you can hack it. They say they are not a call center but that is exactly what they are. Employees are either long time employees or only have a few years of experience. It does make for a nice dynamic. The company has a multitude of changes based on modernizing that they are implementing. However it seems management concentrates on those areas and neglects employee development and culture. Finally I will say training only seemed to capture about 40% to 50% of the job expectations which has been problematic in moving to the production floor.
bad,"Consistently felt like I was being taken advantage of. Company as a whole is very cheap/wont pay for anything. Had to fight to get them to pay for my test as well as a dollar raise for being licensed after they said they would increase my salary ""substantially""."
bad,"Don't expect to make any money as an insurance agent. Most of the district managers have the accounts locked up. They are basically trying to find deep pockets to buy into a franchise. There is no money to be made as a beginning agent. They will get any accounts you do get, after you quit."
bad,"You are just a number in the system.   They local office did not care about you as a person, just what you could produce on a day to day basis.   Did not feel like you had much support."
bad,"They have a tin of agents in the area and their prices are outrageous, so it was extremely difficult to see anything. Retention and claims were very questionable."
bad,The position seemed to change once the new insurance company came in. I trained their employees and continued working my workload but it was not enough.
bad,If you like being over worked and under paid then this is the place for you. Turn over is aweful.Nothing positive to say so I choose not to say anything at all.
bad,"I was able to pick up their system quickly and train others. The biggest draw back for me was someone profiting off my hard work and going on trips, no bonuses, fighting to get holiday pay, and match industry standard hourly pay plus commission."
bad,multitasking was critical and coming to this job which is something I do very well it is a very interesting position due to the fact that there a minimum amount of staff in the building with you and you have a one on one time to connect to the boss and see see what they expect andare able to provide you with Awesome feedback
bad,"Business opportunities are numerous. The concern is the charge back of commissions is what became a concern. Selling in a very competitive market requires immense efforts. Traveling long distance to see potential clients only to find out they were only ""checking"" but insisted I travel to their location was stressful. Having made the sale then finding out a few months later that the client had cancelled the policy made it difficult to manage personal finances as the initial commission for the sale would have to be charged back by the company. Inquiring with the customer that cancelled would determine they cancelled because they received a better rate from a discount insurance company. They did not understand nor cared that the coverage was not just cheaper but nowhere nears the level I was providing."
bad,"The company was ok to work for.  I was bored at times, slow staff, everyone was friendly though.  I like the location of this company.  Friendly staff."
bad,I learned basic admin duties and answering phone calls. As well as giving customers quotes. I learned how to set up new customers as well as serve the existing customers.
bad,Company focused more on numbers then customer service. Many employees have been promoted due to their numbers and lack true customer service skills often passing the buck to the next rep. The company says they want good customer service but really they want quick calls.
bad,"My bad experience was directly with my employer, not with the agency. After a full month of work without pay, my employer decided not to pay me my salary because, his sales on his office were diminishing."
bad,"The office is very unorganized, not properly set up, the staff consists of the agent and myself. Anything the agent doesn't want to deal with is put on myself. Unethical behavior and choices run the office. The best of the job is the normal Monday-Friday 9-5 hours. "
bad,"doing sales only working out of sales center."
bad,"If you don't have $ 20,000 to invest into this business right away, don't do it.  They will provide training and some marketing materials, but other than that, you are on your own!"
bad,"pay structure is nice, but worker hostile management causes extremely high turnover. liked my co workers. heavy work loads, micro managing"
bad,Don't waste your time unless you have money in the bank and a lot of time to spare. Also it helps to have a lot of friends to sell to ahead of time as there are already too many insurance agents out there.
bad,"Management was not good.  Terrible place to work.  A lot of hostility in the office.  Turnover was high.  "
bad,"Multiple claims per day with high workload. Management is not avail when needed (meetings). Co-workers are stressed "
bad,"Interesting Place it has some upside, just be aware of the contracts and the subsidy they try to force you to take. Also know that the book of business you grow belongs to them. The auto rates are higher than most but their HO-3 is very competitive."
bad,takes a lot of your time. You have to be really patient and be great when it comes to problem solving. But you do lean a lot when it comes to marking. I was a sales agent so i was mostly an Independent agent. This meant I was going on feet to gather my clients.
bad,"Telemarketing, and collecting data for quotes."
bad,"Do not have any complaints, was treated well, good salary, good hours, working environment was awesome, can not complain."
bad,Constantly making calls but no one will answer the phone. Get paid mostly on commission but it is hard to make sales/Quote sheets if no one answers. Not very good hours and not very good pay.
bad,"Underwriters no longer manually underwrite business.  Mainly this is done via the computer system.  Underwriters are now in a call center environment.  The goal is to get the customer off the phone and on to the next call/piece of work in under 7 minutes.  It's very production  and numbers oriented instead of client/situation oriented. "
bad,Farmers was a great company to work for. They had an excellent management team as well as a strong patrnership between offices offices. The teal was competitive and efficient.
bad,"The pay is good.  However, performance and pay advancement highly depends on who you are in favor with and if the company is making a profit.  Lots of downsizing so advancement is difficult."
bad,Worked to build my own insurance business from the ground up. You had some support from the company. But you need to have a strong business plan and capital to be successful.
bad,"Great opportunity to develop a fundamental understanding of personal lines underwriting. Also, due to Farmers exceptional education program, employees have the opportunity to obtain advanced degrees and professional designations."
bad,I anticipated much more from this job. It boiled down to phone sales and working a book of business without new leads. I studied hard and got my property and casualty license and was immediately told I needed to get my Life License within a certain period of time. I tried but failed the test (very hard) and was let go because of this. Disappointing on many fronts.
bad,The position is changing from being an adjuster to a paper processor.  Your experience is very dependent on who your supervisor is.
bad,"Opening the office, answering phone calls and answering questions about billing. Had to learn a lot about billing. Management was gone quit a bit and had to learn a lot on my own. Hardest part of the job was having to take my insurance license test over again because it had lapsed. Just enjoyed helping those who needed extra help trying to figure out what was being offered to them."
bad,Learned some good marketing and management skills enjoyed running my own business. But over all bad experience as a reserve agent no management help. cost me a ton of money for marketing and other business expenses.
bad,"maintained a respectful relationship with all clients, monitored monthly reviews of clients policies to give additional discounts if possible. customer service on billing and general questions and payment collections"
bad,They dont promote different ethnicities to management level.  Their benefits package was above the others and they reduced benefits to be competitive.  They also allow their supervisory staff to retaliate if they do not like the employee
bad,"Typical day:  visit six agents "
bad,"When i trained under my district manager, he told me to always read the manual so you will know the business."
bad,Even though I was there for a year and a half every day was the same people calling for quotes or getting the agent prepared on why the customers insurance went up or down.  I wasn't in management at this job.  My co-workers was awesome we work well together and we still keep in touch.  The hardest part of the job was the outcome when you notify a customer of the price jump.  Most enjoyable was helping customer receive the dicounts that is owed to them for all the service they received for their insurance.
bad,I pretty much ran my employer's business for him and he was gone all the time. He told me I would get a 90 day review and I got it on my last day of work (123 days later). He treated  me like I was stupid and when I worked 9-5 he wouldn't give me a lunch break. I learned everything but a few basic tasks on my own and I had no co-workers.
bad,I don't particularly enjoy it. Company culture isn't enjoyable to me. But not necessarily bad for someone else. Accounting department is very fast paced and busy. Lots of overtime. 
bad,"A typical day at work was hectic, fast paced and went by fast. There was a lot to do in regards to making contact with customers and negotiate settlements."
bad,#'s and profits over people. No time for personal developement or time off as your work will just pile up while you are away from your desk. You are micromanaged down to how many minutes you were in the bathroom.
bad,"There are always changes happening within the company. You have to accustom to the changes quick or it is a memo for you. The managers there are so quick to tell you that you are doing something wrong, yet they don't know how to perform the job themselves. The job is very stressful every day."
bad,"After 14 years with Farmers it was time to change. I am thankful that while I was with Farmers I was trained as a multi-line adjuster. Farmers sponsored training at that time was the best around. I attended Property, Auto, Liability and Management schools while I there."
bad,"Call center environment - micro managed - company changed over the years - have some nice perks if you fit in the ""click"" co-workers are very nice - call times"
bad,Just focused on numbers not people. DM was more about making money for Himself then his agents. I made less money here then I did in High School. Wen't into debt over Farmers!
bad,"It was fine when we went through product training. When it came to employee support, making sure we got answers to our questions and the assistance from the staff as promised, they flopped. Not to mention their prices have increased 15% this past year. Their product was 3x higher than most of their competitors for the exact same coverage. If the clients were able to save money, it was only about $10-$60 per year which some would have been overshadowed in policy fees and sometimes less coverage."
bad,I worked in the customer service department for almost 2 years. No one would listen to problems and let the supervisors talk to their teams in horrible manners without caring. When they get overstaffed they look to fire people for any reason. Its not with the abuse you are just a number to them.
bad,"I would not recommend working in customer service for this company. The management is terrible, the supervisors do nothing about complaints or issues, and they play favorites with employees. The pay is good if you have a degree but if not its less than 30k to start off. Everyone was so nice and helpful in training, but after that you were a nobody to them. Oh and you only get paid 2x a month...15th & 30th. You work hard with little to no recognition unless they make money off it (sales)."
bad,This jobs was fun and interesting. I see is as a sort of a insurance refresher course. Iwas impressed with the cleverness of the newer agents. I was most impressed with the knowledge of the industry that was shared by an older Agent who had been the Top Selling Agent in this area for years.
bad,Decent non exempt salaried position as an OCR but with a high turnover rate. Supervisors did not have set guidelines for their employees and meeting a supervisors goals often came at the expense of meeting quality assurance goals. The training was 8 weeks and should have only taken 4 but in no way prepared employees for the job at hand.
bad,1. What is the life span of recruiter here?
bad,Great job if your new boss is not out looking to make an example of you. Watch out for shifty management types. the actual job is a ton of work and time away from the family but its worth doing if you have the right team.
bad,Each agency is different. The one I worked at has no benefit AT  ALL  no advancement. They have half of the staff they supposed to have because they want to save money.
bad,"Very little regard for the health of their employees. Staff is constantly overworked, the position is constantly understaffed, management is not supportive."
bad,"I'm not sure if it was the agency I was placed in or the company itself, but I regret taking this job. The job stress is maximum with minimal benefits."
bad,"Corporate values failed to trickle down. Disconnect between management and employees with unsupportive work environment. Department was an ""every man for hemself"" environment with very few supportive colleagues. Definitely not a team environment. Unrealistic work load with very unsupportive leadership. Horrible job."
bad,"My team lead/manager and I were not a good fit. He was blunt with his criticism, and I would feel a lot of stress during and after our interactions. You constantly had to go over calls with your team lead and with quality assurance (who were a lot kinder). Farmers was always looking for you to be faster and ""better""....if you weren't improving enough, you would hear about it. More than once my team lead said to me ""Maybe you should think about weather or not this is where you really want to be"" and implied I might be let go on a few occasions."
bad,"Over work you, change procedures often , management is not supportive "
bad,"Been under a different BU head every year"
bad,Daily overworked and stressful environment. Little benefit to reach daily goals. Constantly shifting company and department goals. Unrealistic expectations set for anyone but the “top 10 all star workers”
bad,"Not much to say about my experience, the office I worked for was set in old practices and was no advancement available. To generate new business a firm must be willing to grasp new ideas and implement social media and personal meet and greets with your members. This is a way to establish an on going relationship for now and future family members. We as businesses have to evolve with the times and the care of your employees is essential for longtime commitment and loyalty. When licenced employees are asked to generate leads and new business there should be proper compensation."
bad,Training is not organized and people are always yelling at you! I would never work here. Also pay was not the same every time and I wrote down my hours.
bad,Claims employees are overworked and pushed to handle more than humanly possible. Employees are given unrealistic workloads and micro-managed about every tiny detail.
bad,Culture is do more with less and embrace it or we'll find someone who will replace you.  motivation through intimidation.  Promotions are not earned as it is about who you know in the company and you scratch my back I'll scratch yours.
bad,"I made many large sales (corporate), but that doesn't matter to Farmers.  What is important is the NUMBER of sales that you make, regardless of the value of the sale!"
bad,"I took on a producer/csr position and it was understanding that my job was to be a csr. I ended up being suckered in, working for two separate agents as a salesperson, not a full time csr. Farmers is all about sell sell sell."
bad,"During my employment with Farmers insurance working as a workers compensation adjuster, this was a great opportunity to assist and help client, giving direction and getting them back to work or retrain for another position that they were able to perform."
bad,Environment was stressful due to poor management. there was no official policy and procedures ever set for the office. Office was owned and operated by local agent.
bad,"nothing is worse that trying to sell people something that they don't want. My daily duties consisted of cold leads, calling people and offering some sort of car or home insurance quote, which was normally over priced and either on their lunch break or right after they got off worked and usually weren't in the best  mood, Management was hardly their and the office shut down shortly after i left"
bad,"Fairly standard large insurance company practice, though with more than predictable cliques and favoritism, good benefits, nice environment, significant turnover in recent years"
bad,The company keeps piling on more work in the departments when there is always a shortage of employees.  Stress level is too high and high turnover due to the circumstances.
bad,I took calls from employees calling in to file a claim.  I processed the claim and worked closely with the employees throughout the process.  The hardest part was the hours.
bad,"Not what was expected of the company. When I was offered the position, pay was described as a subsidy and not as a loan. Before any funds are available, must meet quotas."
bad,I started off in a new district and it was the worse experience ever they were unorganized and completely useless. It was shut down and then it took 6 months to transfer me to a new district.
bad,"Commercial Billing is  a very confusing department, rules change daily without communication to the actual representatives taking the calls. Little detail is paid attention to quality just get the metrics. Managers know little about the day to day work of representatives."
bad,"Job was flexible, was able to work from home often. Not much room for advancement. Received company bonus each year. Enjoyed my coworkers that I have worked with for years."
bad,"Worked for this company for a year. They were terrible at organization, and didn't care about their new employees at all. Never received proper training."
bad,"As an exempt employee this is exploited. Work evenings, weekends and vacations to keep up. Actual work is enjoyable. Management is poor and always changing."
bad,"I refuse to believe that the experience I was unfortunate to receive is something that is expected to be seen across the board as the company itself is full of great people. As a total loss claims adjuster, you are seen as expendable, are overworked and heavily devalued. Your job entails an excessive amount of work that is far too much for any one person to handle. The work itself is rather manageable, but the workload is such that employees regularly call in sick to have the remainder of the floor work on delayed assignments in order to help catch themselves up. At the end of the day, nobody is ever able to get caught up. The morale is very low. The department is expected to lose 2-3 employees per month. With only about 40 employees, the department is understaffed and the turnover is well over 100% per year. Pay is good. The 401k match is incredible. Training is adequate to give you the tools to be able to function independently with confidence. Many of my coworkers gladly took pay cuts to be transferred to other departments to lower the stress in their lives. This job led to family problems for some, depression for others and many resorted to picking up smoking cigarettes and have developed alcohol problems. Again, I reiterate as I feel it important to stress that I don't believe this to be a company wide issue so much as it may be something for the particular position."
bad,"Company restructured and moved all licensed agents from sales department to customer service call center. Lost our commission and weekends off. If you were a senior agent, you took the hardest hit. Regular agents got a salary raise while more experienced did not. Then shortly after starting CSR position, training began for sales (which we had already been doing previously) but the sales would no longer bring any commissions. Many left after the restructure. I tried to hold on but the experience took a toll on my health since I no longer had weekends off which allowed me no time to decompress. Callers were rude and it was not at all enjoyable. Felt like I was flying by the seat of my pants. Training was mostly useless. They need more organization and better thought out long term plans. You don't hire people then 4 months later eliminate their department and tell them they should be grateful to still have a job even though the new job will pay as much in the hours will be worse in the work will be more difficult."
bad,I worked for Farmers in the claims department for 8 years.  At first the culture was great.  We were a big family who were proud of where we worked.  In year 2 they started cutting benefits and it all started going down hill.  Constant audits lead to everyone being written up for even minor errors as work loads soared.  Management started ruling by the fear of punishment.  Most all the good people have quit.  The others feel trapped and hate their jobs.  Do yourself a favor and look else where for employment.
bad,"Customer Services"
bad,It was a good job overall but the environment was very uncomfortable at times.  There were also a lot of mixed messages about what is important.
bad,"I worked from home, I barely was in the office but when I did go in, it was a very good peer to peer interaction. I was in two departments in the 12 years there. I learned about Auto Insurance. Learned the system through my different Managers & Co Workers. The hardest part of my job was not being in the building on a regular to learn more. Interacting with Agents/Peers"
bad,"I am all for expansion.  However, you need to have reasonably good rates in the insurance market.  Extremely high rates, with one or two products being competitive.  Before throwing millions of dollars into marketing and development, fix the product."
bad,"I am currently employed in the call center - claims (not for long) and absolutely despise it.  You sit in a chair for 8 hours a day, having your phone calls listened to all the time with no chance of being promoted.  I see so many people who have extremely high scores but don't kiss butt enough to move up in the company.  If you make any small talk with a customer, you are told that you talk to much and need to just do the job.  Pretty much you are a robot doing whatever your supervisor tells you to.  You have no say in how to do your job and customers hate Farmer's because the price is ridiculous and agents don't want to stay cause the pay sucks.  Can't wait till I'm done at this place and find a real job with real potential.  The ONLY upside is you get a lot of vacation time."
bad,Farmers was a great company until they shift to the help point model.  Yes the company became more efficient but in the end employee and agent moral became worse as the months and years passed by.
bad,Way to many middle manager & half of them do not know what they are doing
bad,Profit sharing was wonderful. Claim count was excessive. Company was very conservative 
bad,Not my ideal job. Learned about all types of insurance. Management was be your own manager. My co worker was the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was the testing 
bad,very hectic not much room for advancement at this time. downsizing as we speak. for an insurance company you would think they have better benefits.
bad,"Inconsistant, lack of training, poor training program. It is a good opportunity for someone who is leaving another company. Management is poor."
bad,"There are only a couple of ways to survive or make money as an independent agent. It is commission only with little to no support. If you can buy a book of business off came from realistate or similar background with a huge contract list, there is a chance. Farmers is expensive and built for a specific clientele."
bad,"Compensation is good, incentives are okay but there is no concept of work life balance."
bad,"I will start with the positives. Many positions at the company now have a work from home option (only after having completed training and remained with the company for a bit), only requiring you to be physically in the office once per week. The paid-time off is another perk, as you start with 12 days and after a year that gets bumped up to 17."
bad,"Illinois is a permanent catastrophe zone.  It seems like every year we break the record for number of claims in a year, simply for that record to be broken again the following year.  Management loads you with 150 to 200% percent of your capacity for the amount of time that you are approved to work."
bad,"Farmer's is one of those companies that is so far in the past, they don't even realize they have a problem. The applications are outdated and some are practically unusable. They like to give the impression that they welcome change while actively discouraging new ideas. Good luck trying to get into a different department because management has probably already decided your career trajectory. They also have the stupid surveys multiple times a year where they encourage you to tell about how much you love working there. They actually had a meeting before one encouraging everyone to put a more positive score than the previous survey, rather than trying to correct the problems of unhappy employees. Why fix problems when you can encourage employees to lie about how much they love their job?"
bad,"Farmers is a great place to work, especially if you do not have much experience.  The reasoning for my scoring is because they struggle to choose managers and leaders who understanding the purpose of our customers and spend time and money to change practices instead of evolve practices.  "
bad,"Farmers is a great place to work if you are not looking for advancement. Since you will be with an agency, the only higher position would be agency owner."
bad,"The worst thing about Farmers is their appetite restrictions. For example, FARMERS will not accept anyone with or prior insurance, whether its a business or personnel. They will not accept state minimum prior insurance."
bad,"It was a decent job, although over qualified for the position, advancement was difficult even though qualified and was excelling at current position according to reviews but current supervisor."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"The contract was not clearly presented. Compensation was a loan, not salary. Your debt just got bigger over time. There was no point in continuing to create an agency under those conditions."
bad,Customer Service and selling. There are constant issues being addressed due to the amount of agents and lack of management. It is difficult to keep up.
bad,"When I started as a new insurance agent here, I was put into the district office expecting to get a lot of much needed training...I got none at all.  I was left in an office, by myself, with little to no help or guidance."
bad,During my three years there middle management was cleared out three times. Add in a 25% across the board layoff and you can understand how moral wasn't the best. Claims files were extensively audited and individual adjuster's audit figures were displayed for all to see - with below expectations ratings marked in red. Not a big deal if you're hitting all the numbers but with reduced staff claim volume was crazy. 3 people quit in my office the week before I put in my notice. I still keep in touch with some that still work there and it seems things have calmed down. Compensation was good and of the three companies I've been with Farmers was the most mentally stimulating. Had the work/life balance not been so skewed it would have been a great place to work.
bad,"Generally things are quite nice but job security in the average agent's office is rare, goals set by corporate change frequently, the corporate mindset seems to be shifting towards hiring agents that are aiming to quickly build a book of business and start their own agency (not a bad concept but it will cause turnover rates to skyrocket for those who can't maintain the cut). "
bad,"They pay well, provide great benefits but there is a feeling that every employee is replaceable and your position is not secure.  Management is of poor integrity as well."
bad,Job is very repetitive and management tries to help but it is such a big company nothing ever really gets done. The people there are friendly and very helpful but there is a disconnect from management when they say they want people to be happy and not over work themselves then expect people to work mandatory overtime.
bad,"The best part about the job was the employee groups that tried to make the work day fun and engaging. Management was disorganized and did not appear to work together. I had 10 previous years of experience working in claims and it did not seem to matter. There were a lot of double standards among the supervisors. If I had started my career here, it might have been fine."
bad,.  Company is profit oriented and employees are trained to make judgement decisions that are sometimes counter intuitive.  Average length of time in position is long.
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 10 years and I have had only 1 good manager in my time there. The company talks a lot about supporting their employees and employee development, but frankly, it's all talk. They elevate people with good technical skills and smarts, but who don't have the interpersonal skills to manage, develop, and support those around them. "
bad,"Typically, I would come to work and immediately dread the day because there is poor in-house communication and supervisors will often not do their jobs. I have learned many steps to customer service and how to manage a workday efficiently . But after having a close personal friend pass away and being allowed to take more than a day off of work, they've managed to erase any thought of me maintaining a position at this company. The people you work with are very wonderful, and are typically understanding and fun. The worst part of the job is that they've implemented a system so there is a different adjuster for many different steps of the process which confuses and irritates customers. Between being on the phone throughout the day and feeling stressed out enough to feel uncomfortable with breaks in the day."
bad,"The company structure doesn't lend to team building, but the every day worker is great.  Management has no clear, coherent guidelines or synergy.  The insurance business can be ambiguous and if you need clear instruction and disciplined environment don't apply."
bad,"typical day is very draining, I have learned that you must know people to move up in the company.  Management likes to set goals that are unable to be accomplished so no raised can be given out.  Co-workers are great and friendly. Hardest part of the job is trying not to worry and bring your work home."
bad,"Owning an Agency is a very difficult job. Especially starting out with nothing. I gave it my all and pushed and pushed myself to my breaking point. I made one mistake on a renters insurance policy and was treated as if I was an outcast. I got every license and every achievement that I could in order to qualify myself and my district for bonuses and after that, they really had hardly anything to do with me."
bad,"Farmers Insurance is more interested in saving money than satisfying claims.  Due to a huge volume of fraudulent claims in South Florida, Farmers refuse to negotiate the settlement of claims.  As a result, a lot of Farmers claims end up in litigation."
bad,"Managed insurance business when my customers had any concerns.  I had to market and sell to potential clients.  I have worked for Farmers for five years, and it is time to move on."
bad,"I worked for Famers Insurance in and out for two years because the first agent I worked for got let go from the company due to low enrollments. "
bad,"This is a typical call center. Get the call, answer the question as quickly as possible, move on to next call. Everything timed. Everything recorded. Lot of stress."
bad,full commission sales. I needed a steady income so I found another job
bad,"I worked virtually and traveled to different offices coaching personnel on how to be more productive, feel important in their job, and to obtain a better work/life balance. "
bad,Actually everything was great with Farmers until I moved to one of their divisions for auto insurance 21st Century. They have a systematic way of making you want to leave if you are over the age of 50. It keeps happening over and over. I was told that I was fired for calling myself a derrogatory name in a private conversation. I was moved from sales to a position of rewriting lapsed policies for customers. I no longer was eligible for overtime or commission because 21st Century did not want to pay commissions on rewrites.
bad,"no job security, very little flexibility. The company is ridding itself of the very people who have worked hard to help them achieve everything that they have at the kansas city servicepoint. Tenured, knowledgeable employees..all in the name of saving money. They are now bringing  these newbies through the door promising them a future but in all actuality they will hit the glass ceiling within the first year. Management CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!  They will lie and try and manipulate any situation that may expose whats actually going on. The only thing that I can say that's positive about Farmers is that the pay is decent.  The benefits package use to be awesome but since about 2006 they have slowly but surely changed every good thing about the benefits."
bad,"Heavy phones, directors are cold and untrustworthy, co-workers are great, hardest part of the job is being tied to your desk, most enjoyable part of the job is helping agents."
bad,"I started my career in records and ended in claims. It got to a point where there just weren't enough adjusters to handle the case load. I enjoyed my co-workers and my two bosses were amaze balls. my last boss on the other hand, not so much...I was terminated under her watch and she was the first sup to write up a negative review on my work ethics. the compensation back in the day was amazing with profit sharing and medical. I now hear that they offer a traditional 401k...bummer"
bad,"While the opportunity to develop your agency with Farmers is rewarding in the end, the journey getting there is very difficult. I have been here in San Antonio less than a year, and trying to reach people who you have never met is extremely difficult."
bad,"I stared with the company under the promise of University of Farmers training and help with clients lists. There was no training and I was told to get everything on my own. It was not a team atmosphere, very individual based. Was very disappointed, not a good working atmosphere."
bad,"Outdated resources, technology, software aside, also outdated unprofessional people management skills go unchecked. I do not recommend this location of this company."
bad,"Farmers had good training.   Then low pay, so had to leave to secure competitive salary.  However, some stayed and moved up a management ladder... but those friends all left after a few years to secure a fair salary."
bad,"There was no official training program at Farmers, ended up mostly self teaching or learning from online videos on how to use the computer system. It seems like the communication between Agents and the Main Office was inconsistent and left subordinates without much support. While the pay was good, the management of everything else was somewhat lacking."
bad,"This job as a sales representative is on that requires dedication, planning and perseverance. It takes time to build an book of business so you need to have another income source if you are making a career change into this field."
bad,"This will not be a petty /venting review, more so a forewarning. I and many others hated this position. However, some actually loved it. It depends on your personality, I think. "
bad,"Farmers is not an innovator, it takes a conservative, risk averse approach to everything it does. The Sourcing & procurement team is significantly behind and very far from best in class. Management lacks leadership, the team lacks skills, and there is not enough support across the enterprise for Sourcing and procurement to be effective"
bad,"I feel they are lacking in training their new agents. Not everyone can watch a video and call it good. I also feel they try to push out new agents with their new commission structure. The rates are not competitive AT ALL in the area, plus with the commission cuts, makes it very hard to build your business."
bad,Great incentives Great incentives Great incentives.  I have to use one hundred and fifty characters and don't have much to say. I like turtles and beer.
bad,"I worked with farmers as an independent agent, i was in charge of my own office, scheduling, hiring, and direction. The freedom is nice but the goals they expect you to meet are challenging, especially if you work in a city that is over saturated with their other agents, like I did."
bad,"I'm from property claims. I have worked for a few insurance companies, with Farmers being the worst place to work in my opinion -- management has a long way to go. Property claims was understaffed, but management wouldn't hire the adjusters needed to spread out the work load. Senior adjusters were leaving left and right for other departments because they couldn't handle the huge workload or the managers. With that you end up with the new people having to work overtime, falling behind, and getting stuck with messy claims. The pile never seems to get down, and management will use the amount of overtime you work or how many claims you have against you in reviews. When you complain about the workload they then tell you that we should've expected this was coming in our catastrophe environment."
bad,"They didn't supply you with any leads. Without leads it was very difficult to develop a book of business. Every agency is differen though, so it depends on the agency owner as to how successful you can be."
bad,overall good company worked with agents and tried to help resolve customer related and company issues feel they cared about employees relaxed atmosphere
bad,"This review is for working in a Property Branch Claims Office. I've heard some Branch Claims Offices are better than others. The office I worked in was comprised of mostly incompetent and lazy employees, supervisors, and manager. They don't see the big picture. Luckily, I quit."
bad,I enjoyed the customer service experience but there was always downtime. often the agent would leave as soon as I would get there and be gone for the rest of the day and leave me with little to no tasks to be done in the 4 hour block that I was there.
bad,Very tough job with a lot of work in a short amount of time.  Co-workers were great.  Management was who you knew not what you know.  Claims is a position that you need to stay in for a few years to get experience coming out of college then move on.
bad,"The job was sold to me much like the policies I was trying to sell to clients. After passing my licensing test, I was given 4 days of training and little follow up assistance by district management. I was trained by my DM's wife who was not licensed to sell insurance. Needless to say, training wasn't all that in-depth. When I did need help, I was more likely to get it from the unlicensed recruiter in the office than I was from my DM who spent most of his time in his office with the door locked. I think the job could be a good one for someone who is willing to work the hours it takes to meet with enough people to sell the required amount of policies every quarter in order to keep your subsidy, but it wasn't for me."
bad,"Great job and great pay, processed claims for auto insurance"
bad,Management struggles and poor office moral. Lack of leadership by owners and unprofessional staff members.
bad,"Typical office experience, friendly staff low volume office."
bad,"The company knows how to lead change even with its large employee base, even with the wake of hiccups they have been able to implement, re-evaluate, re-align, and implement. Most challenging aspect is remaining available for your customer as this is the focus of my duty. "
bad,Micro managed and competitive enviroment with constant change and work requirements.  
bad,I spend alot of my time marketing for new prospects also on the phone with underwriters
bad,"I worked on my own pace, setting up appointments and demo insurance sales as I pursaded clients to purchase. I had to use tremendous amount of pressure to get clients to purchase"
bad,"I inspect 3-4 cars per day at various places though mostly at body shops. My territory consists of a lot of difficult shops, including Eli's and Paulees, along with City of Stars and Rick's Auto Body and many other shops. I am a problem solver and good negotiator."
bad,"Farmers puts a lot of pressure on their employees.  They offset this with great pay and benefits but that only then makes one feel trapped.  Once you are in, you feel you can't leave because of the pay cut, yet the work is stressful and pressure driven.  It's an unhealthy cycle."
bad,"The wages are fantastic. However, very stressful work environment. The managerment pushes for unrealistic goals for you, and your team. They micromanaged down to the second.They do not take our ideas into consideration to make things better in Service Operations/personal lines. The mind set of the floor and overall happiness of employees next to none. People in our department are not happy with what they do."
bad,"80 to 120 calls per day which included anything from billing issues from customers to producing new policies or changes for external and internal agents. Continuing education was required, and they presented excellent resources and time to meet requirements. However, if an employee didn't fit well with the immediate supervisor; they were on a fast pace to be terminated."
bad,"While the company may appear attractive at first, don't get too comfortable as things WILL change.  There is rapid change with very little notice several times per year.  The compensation is great - almost too good as once you make a certain amount and realize you'll take a pay cut going anywhere else, you begin to feel trapped."
bad,"Owner had serious problems with work ethic.  The atmosphere was ok to work in, however some of the things that were asked of me made me very uncomfortable."
bad,"The job is fine. But I don't see it long term at all. There's no benefits, no 401K and not very good pay. I love working from home three days, but not enough to stay."
bad,"As I do enjoy the opportunities provided. The agent of whom I work with is very small minded, and unfair to other employees. The office turnover (hire/fire) ratio is not in favor of the employees. I have been here since 01/31/2017, and have seen four co-workers hired and then fired within a one-two week time span. Overall the work environment is unstable, and unprofessional."
bad,"Farmers pulling out of Florida, did not want to pay Sr. adjuster in the field his(my) severance due...made up an excuse, fell silent, peers running scared."
bad,"If you succeed you could be having a great lifestyle, but if you don't you could be in 70 thousand dollars of debt. At least that is how that agency did things."
bad,"Farmers has a whole machine dedicated to supporting it's desktops. You don't as a developer have admin rights to your laptop, so you must go through this machine to setup your development environment. The problem is it takes 3-4 weeks before the desktop team can help you."
bad,"long  hours, with  heavy  workload, very  slow  claims  process  with  delays  in  settlement  authorization."
bad,A typical day at work was filled with cold calling and attempting to peak interest in insurance sales to customers. 
bad,Given the freedom to be your own boss and work as many hours as you want. There was not much help from Farmers to offer benefits or capital to start your own agency. Most of the business was created through your own networking and marketing programs. This is not a job that would be recommended to anyone starting out in the insurance industry. There is very little money to be made unless you already have a solid client base.
bad,Stay away you have no value and they will keep cutting commissions and they are the most expensive company out there not even in the ballpark of being competitive in the market.
bad,"You receive good benefits including 401k, medical, dental, and generous vacation. Management is sub par. A lot of nepotism and walking on egg shells,  so it is diificult to communicate issues freely."
bad,"Opportunity to represent one of the best home insurance companies in Georgia. Also provides opportunity for special event coverage for needs for weddings, etc. Several out of office opportunities provided to build your book of business."
bad,"Fast paced, high stress not for everyone. I enjoyed the job for a long time then the culture began to change. More was expected, without the same level of support. I saw a lot of good people get burnt out and leave."
bad,I can't give a review of the company as the department I worked for moved out of state and I'm unaware of management or any other important variables pertaining to the job.
bad,"Was not there long. the company is not the best, needs major improvments. I was a summer intern and it was not the best. small quiet not much business"
bad,"it is awful, you sit in a cubicle all day with a phone headset on, talking to people who have totaled their vehicles, handling over 100 a day, lunch was the best part"
bad,"Poorly organized department with unreasonably high expectations on how quickly software systems were to be mastered.  None of the software systems communicated with each other, making for a lot of duplicate work."
bad,Learned to deal with all kinds of customers. Dealt with all kinds of personalities which is a skill i am grateful for. My boss always pushes us to sell so that was stressful at times.
bad,Typical administrative assistant work; data entry. The office was pretty big so you had the opportunity to learn about other areas in insurance industry. Pay is good for a College student!
bad,"At the time, it had a tolerably good training program. Good pay to learn the business but few considered it a career to stay with this company. In flux at the time as parent company Zurich exerted more control."
bad,Great company but they are changing rapidly and moving a lot of offices and will continue to do so.  If you like lots of change and the possibility of moving this would be a great job for you.
bad,"The environment is mostly nice, just dealing with people that you work with. Supervisors tend to pick their favorites for everything. They continue to hire people when they don't have work and don't hire enough people when there is a lot of work."
bad,"Insurance agency. Secretary. Met with clients regarding their home, auto, rental, and life insurance policies. Answered customers questions regarding their policies. Managed payments."
bad,It was a fun workplace with a laid back management team. I learned how to effectively work in the Copy and Print area here.
bad,"There is a great work/life balance and the benefits are good but this isn't enough to keep the scales even.  If the recruiters still don't tell people about what this job is really like, know that you can probably only thrive if you enjoy call center work. Most people will agree that the best part of the job is the people you work with but, due to the nature of the job and the suffocating environment, the people you work with are highly likely to be there only for a couple of years."
bad,"During my training,  Farmers went through some reorganization so I had to start over 3 times.  Since this was commission only, I could not live on commission only.  So I went back to my roots to work for an Agent."
bad,Recruiters are very friendly. Product is hard to sell in the current market.
bad,I was not paid right because I was just an Agents Assistant. He was not a very humble or nice guy.. I did learn quite a bit though from working there and was happy I was given the opportunity.
bad,High claim volume is expected. Depending on the location can be either an excellent company or not so excellent.
bad,I picked up some well needed experience here. This is the perfect job to help me get back into the flow of working again.
bad,Great co workers but management is off a bit.  Supervisor who shouldn't be often comes from who they know instead of  their work ethic.
bad,"Typical day consisted of reviewing resumes online via job search engines and contacting possible candidates to advise of job opportunity to become an insurance agent. The job itself was very basic and simple for any person to do. I did not enjoy calling people to tell them of the job, only to later advise huge investment would be needed to be ""successful""."
bad,"I worked for Farmers during & after the Zurich acquisition and the culture there did not suit at all."
bad,"•	Established expansive East Tennessee network by generating countless consulting appointments"
bad,"N/A"
bad,"Working for a Farmer's agent will obviously differ from one to the other. My experience was good at this particular agent's office, but there is not much of an opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Farmers Insurance is a terrific company to work for in regards to the personal satisfaction of helping people in time of crisis and tragedy. The claim load is consistent and challenging.. Time management is one of the most important requirements for being successful with this company. There is a lot of in-house incentive programs to strive for success. Also, an in-house insurance university online that helps expedite your job growth, knowledge and merit advancement.. Pay and benefits are outstanding.."
bad,This is a great job if you have a solid DM and a good list of contacts. If you lack those two things you will hate it.
bad,I was responsible for executing orders from the manager and managing a staff of 6-8 people. I was responsible for keeping sales high and meeting quotas myself as well as motivating employees to do the same. The hardest part of the job was working nights and every weekend.The most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow co-workers.
bad,"Staff always there to help.  "
bad,company was helpful in their assistance and training. Did not give much in terms of real advice to its agents.But It was a very impactful learning experience.
bad,spent 9 years in the army most of which was active duty. I was a combat engineer and ended my career as a non-commissioned officer (SGT E-5). It was a tough but rewarding 9 years.
bad,Farmers Insurance Gp is lagging behind on innovative marketing strategies.  The company needs to re-assess its marketing strategy!  Possibly a name change to reflect a universal appeal to all.
bad,My own office. Prospect and sell insurance products for Farmers Insurance. Income is limited by product pricing(uncompetitive).
bad,"-always something to work on "
bad,I enjoyed what I was doing.  I took time to explain and answer the customer questions.  My employee was all about the number and just wanted fast.  I feel I was just jumping from one customer to the other.  I was there for 30 years it was not the Farmers Family that it used to be.
bad,"No big support for bilingual questions, the coverage change to often and different criteria for each customer, poor managment"
bad,"Company was good to work with, though not the ultimate company but has a good work ethic and Work culture."
bad,Before you make the decision to become an insurance agent for any carrier you really have to do your homework.   I spoke to different companies before deciding to go with Farmers.  It is the less risky of all of the business models but it comes with its own risk.  If I could go back I would have kept my job while doing this.   All the money that these company two about is not easy to attain.   Most of the agents I met that started with me were all struggling to pull in enough money to pay their bills.   You have to dig deep into your savings!
bad,"You stayed very busy. As you took incoming calls for any claim by insured Farmers customer. Hard at first and can feel like you learned nothing in training. However, they have great coaches that help out a lot."
bad,"On a typical day I would get to work and immediately construct a plan to prioritize everything that needed to get done, while trying to keep up with new assignment and close current assignments. At times it seemed manageable but in the end it would get out of control."
bad,a day at this job is very relaxing and taking incoming customers from different people as well.
good,"Farmers drives new sales activity monthly in order to earn a bonus which used to be part of commission and renewal commission. Therefore you must constantly be acquiring new customers in the company defined lines of business and the volume determined by the company as well as retaining the current book of business in order to earn the monthly bonus. The monthly bonus is significant and must be achieved to support overhead. Small business owner challenges apply as in any other small business. For example, identifying and hiring quality staff. Long hours due to managing all the details of a small business, planning and preparing marketing strategies, etc. after business hours since you have to spend business hours selling."
good,"Opening and closing of office. Performed basic office procedures."
good,"Agency owner was unorganized and lazy. Her son worked for her and exhibited the same qualities, to call them that at the least. Drinking alcohol in the office was not frowned upon. Owner was always sick and closing the office, altering my pay. Don't apply, much better opportunities elsewhere."
good,"I worked for IBEX which was hired by Farmers to do there member services  dept. I enjoyed the challenge it brought everyday. But Farmers decided to take it's buisness, to another company out side the US. so i do not support them they do not support the US"
good,"Thought this job was going to be a great new step for me, but it turned out to be a joke. No level of good compensation to have a livable wage. The Agents are not understanding, or even pay for study time for test. Not the best decision for me."
good,"Good company, great products even a bit pricey.  Working here is not advised as the DMs are not interested in seeing new agents advance it seems.  They provide very little support and are not interested in doing anything other than holding a occasional meeting."
good,"Brokers office. You are responsible for making your comission and paper work on time. Must be able to multi task. Must have good customer service for all clients. computer experience. Must be able to put in data entry of all customers and be able to quote car, home, rental, motor home, motorcycle, non owners, boat."
good,"Farmers could be a good company to work for if the Agent you work for is well trained and has good management skills. everyday at work. Could be horrible if you dont have good"
good,"High pressure claims job, that requires constant overtime to complete daily assigned tasks. Management is too segregated, which leads to unfair advancement and promotion opportunities between coworkers."
good,Do not work for Farmers in Small Markets or Dying Towns. Robust cities and you can make money.  Rates are determined outside the State used and management acts like rates are what they are despite being higher than competition
good,"answering calls servicing the clients needs, claims, sales and marketing. I loved what i did and my clients appreciated that, receiving a thank you and a family/friend referral was very rewarding for me."
good,"Shift bids, The hours are Monday through Sunday. Some teams have 10 hour shifts. Working a weekend day and chat plus phone.30 minute lunches. Excellent training program."
good,"Working for a Farmers agent is good except not being able to find licensed people to help out. If you are looking for a job with benefits, most Farmers agents to provide them. The hardest part was having to man the fort while agent was out at meetings. I do have to say the best part is meeting some very amazing clients and building relationships."
good,They didnt give me enough hours. My boss didnt even train me my co worker did and then my boss said it was wrong. We had to do weekly evuation but my boss never stuck to it.
good,"favoritism towards the wrong people, policy standards are only true for some people, communication is lacking, too many layers which reduces actual effectiveness."
good,"Too much work, consistent  staffing issues, no work life balance and a management staff that is not pro active on resolving issues."
good,"Work life balance was non existent. "
good,"This was a temporary job while finding something more stable. This was a good job for me, but not something I could make a career out of."
good,"I learned a great deal from my last job in Insurance.  I came from a background in healthcare and with little training I became office manager and was very dedicated to my customers and had some "
good,this company was new it just started and with in the time i was there it never really grew i believe it needed more time.
good,"It has its days some busy some slow , customers very polite lean something new every day, make sure to long every call that comes in, transfer calls to the agent"
good,Always new products and procedures to learn.  The company offers no room for advancement unless you become self-employed. The company offers no benefits at the District level.
good,"The company overall is good but it depends on the agent you work for. "
good,"Long hours, management doesn't know what they're doing.  Trying to recruit agents in a down economy was tough but they expected results.  Lack of training."
good,Highly stressful.  Tossed into the insurance industry with little direction and then tossed into being a business owner with little direction.  Sales quotas will be the same nationwide regardless of the community you're working in.
good,"There is procedure for everything. No room for creativity. The hours are incredibly long. Because working from home is so widespread, it's difficult to get business done.  Interaction suffers.  The industry is suffering due to global warming and natural disasters."
good,"Products offered did not fit surrounding areas budget, which made it difficult for adding multi-products to the customers policy's. You had to work harder to get many single accounts. and if you had a larger multi-policy customer, you lost counts if you lost that customer and had to make those policy's up or be penalized."
good,"As the Agency Producer, I was responsible for prospecting, soliciting, quoting, and selling both new and renewal accounts. Specific sales goals and service responsibilities were determined during the yearly planning process. Service and sales standards must be met with emphasis placed on the quality of the insurance product presented to the client. Essential Duties and Responsibilities included assisting in the development of the sales objectives. Meeting the forecasted premium volume and commission growth goals as established with the Agent. Creating and maintaining prospect and suspect lists. Constantly request referrals from existing client base and respond to the referrals quickly and effectively. Ability to quickly pre-qualify insurance prospects for insurability and quality of risk. Ability to identify the client’s insurance needs, gaps in coverage, and loss exposures both insurable and uninsurable. Ability to obtain accurate information from the prospects; including completing applications, supplemental questionnaires, risk surveys, and other related documentation in order to provide complete, comprehensive submissions. Confidently designs insurance programs and recommend insurance coverage to clients. Voluntarily participating in community activities on behalf of the agency. Offer reviews to client’s insurance programs annually and makes recommendations. Accurately documents client files and electronic files as to coverage discussions, quotes, declination, and coverage change or declined. Maintain a concern for timeliness and completeness when interacting with clients,"
good,"Lack of support for staff. They worry to much about pleasing agents and not taking care of employees unless you ""fit"" the culture. Very hard to move up unless you are willing to give over your soul."
good,"A typical day is in the box testing of the same exact things over and over. Very mundane, very strict environment. worked there about a year and did not know ANY of my co-workers."
good,"Secretarial tasks, assisting clients with premium payments, filing, etc"
good,Lots of nepotism and harassment of employees by certain manager
good,I was at work on time everyday and sometimes early.  I missed one day during the year I was there.  There were times of frustration with the owner because he was new to the business.
good,supervisors don't have experience.  some are rude.  issues that arise are not addressed causing stress on employees who are just trying to do their job and get through the shift.
good,"Over all, it's a place that provides a pay check. It was a good place to work but not a place that I would highly recommend especially for bilingual employees."
good,I have mixed feelings about working for the company .There was very little concern for the lack of competitiveness of our auto insurance product. This lack of understanding has led me to look for a new position.
good,"While I enjoyed the work, I did not enjoy the atmosphere at work.  Many people live together, were family members, had dated, went to school together, grew up together.  So if you had a break up everyone knew.  There was a lot of mean girls behavior, not just among women and includes the supervisors and managers."
good,My mornings started out with reviewing the dashboard to handled any customer service issues. Marketing either by phone or canvas. Writing policies and handling paper work I loved my job helping customers insure the right coverage while saving them money and building a customer relationship. Accounting and bank deposits were done at the end of the day! I managed 2 employees handing scheduling and payroll while motivating positive attitudes.
good,"Farmers took on Rate 3 times the first year, even when you sell a policy Farmers will tell you that the customer dosent fit their Appetite, no new auto policies unless  you are already covered."
good,I did not fit in with this working environment well.  It requires a lot of overtime that is not compensated.  Not a great place if you are a single mother.
good,This work was challenging and I learned so much about civil & workers' compensation litigation.  The goals that management set for employees/associates were usually unreasonably high or near impossible to meet.  I think this was the strategy so annual reviews would be low.
good,"Was not the right fit for me at the time I entered. Pretty much a sales position, which was not my what I expected. But great experience to understand a new industry for me."
good,I worked SERVICE from my home office and was never paid on time and sometime 2 mos late.  The Agent has severe money troubles and I was the last to get paid if I did not get left out.
good,The management staff needs leadership training.  I do appreciate the paid adjuster licensing opportunities.  The communication of management is very poor.
good,Good work environment but not a lot of growth opportunity unless you know the right people and have a good amount of money to start your own agency and know business owners.
good,Loyalty is expected but not given. No advancement. No acknowledgment for hard work. Complaints go unheard unless you're willing to work in a friction environment.
good,My office was very unorganized and management did not offer training when needed. Agents did not call customers back all of the time when it was requested.
good,"I enjoyed working for Farmers Insurance, a typical day of work would include me going into the office and checking my emails. I would converse with my fellow office co-workers about work that needs to be done that day. As the day goes on I would work not the office files, talk with clients and execute what they wanted done as they walked in and whatever else the boss had requested me to do that day."
good,"I enjoyed working at Farmers but for the amount of work I did and the amount of premium I personally brought in, I should have been treated with a little more respect. Bringing in over 300k in premium in just over a year. I would make on average 100 cold calls a day to set up appointments to give the prospect a quote. I was micro managed so it was not enjoyable at all. The workplace culture was very independant and not a lot communication in the office. I like being able to work in groups and individually. Farmers was strictly independent which I didn't completely enjoy. The hardest part of the job was making so many cold calls, but that is sales so I put my life on the line and busted my bum. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with clients and closing big accounts. My biggest account in premium dollars was 180k. I enjoyed talking with my current clients and helping them in anyway I could."
good,"There is favoritism; when 21st was acquired by Zurich group of companies, they made a mistake putting Farmers on the list. Most of the Farmers agents were uninformed victims that merely took a blow to the chops. We were encouraged as call center agents to work with the exclusive or field agents who would sometimes call us because they could not get a contract through usually as a result of claims or tickets. There was a lot of time between calls, and I always took overtime when I could to meet the goals. I acquired a low metric of performance regardless of meeting goal which netted a result of my being grouped in a quorum of low performers without the same acumen and work ethic and all of us marked for ""transition"". There were other people who performed lower and had more seniority and tenure as well achieved the minimum acceptable rating somehow were not called or singled out."
good,"process claims documents, take pictures, write estimates, gather evidence and information for claims investigations, submit payments to customers and clients, negotiate settlements"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of meetings and working with various departments, then work on your projects to meet company deadlines.  The hardest part is to balance meetings and projects."
good,Unrealistic goals and high case load. Employees expected to work over-time without compensation. Local management ignored recommendations of regional management. Resulted in class action suit against Farmers which was won by employment.
good,"This used to be a great place to work, but changes and incompetent managers are making it a terrible place to be. The work is very repetitive. The only people who advance are people who have no technical knowledge and can interview well. The co-workers are the best thing about this job but even lately, everyone is jaded. High production demands and micro management will wear on an employee, even a top performer."
good,Enjoyed learning about insurance and met a lot of really nice people.  Farmers is a changing company and I enjoyed my experience with them.
good,Come in and start the computer and get set up for the day. Learned how to create policies for different needs. Management was okay. Only worked with two other people one was cooperative the other was higher than us and didnt want to help. Hardest part was not being able to make a sale.
good,"Farmer's pays you well compared to others in the industry. You have a good opportunity to get an annual bonus. The down side is upper management, though. This company micro manages its employees and sets goals that are not attainable. If you do attain them, no matter as if you are in the bottom 10% but still met your goals, you are only a party meets. They try to make your ""behaviors"" the only way to make an exceeds. Obviously this is a ""subjective"" system. I will say if you keep your head down and say ""yes"" and play the game, you will do well. You just feel stifled as you can't be honest. It is a company where you are thrilled when they rate you a meets. They look great on paper and they try, but are totally misguided due to upper management philosophy."
good,"Multi phone lines, filing, customer relations for new policies and claims.  Computer input of all policies, claims, mail etc.  Schedule appointments for agent."
good,I prefer not to say anything about this job and company. We parted ways amicably and it's just better to leave it that way.
good,"While working as an agency producer I found great joy in helping customers find the correct coverage for their current needs. I was paid on time by the DM and one agent. They did have a great learning environment, and was a great place to start in the P&C industry."
good,"I originally started at Bristol West Insurance in 2000 and appreciated the opportunities I was given, including the chance to work hard to advance and the opportunities to share my opinions with management and other employees.   Farmers purchased Bristol West around 2009 and things changed.  I do not wish to make any further comments. "
good,Goals set are unrealistic and absolutely no job security. I worked here for 5 years and felt like I could lose my job at any time. The training is excellent though.
good,"It's challenging to build an insurance agency from scratch, particularly in tough economic times. Farmers does help with low interest subsidy loans, but in order to continually requalify for the loan program, you must sell the mix of business that the company decrees. That can prove difficult if your focus is commercial, for example; you are still required to sell a significant number of personal lines policies each month"
good,"A typical day started by printing my daily tasks as well as checking and satisfying the morning alerts, Briefed with manager (insurance agent) on daily tasks. Answered and directed incoming phone calls. Learned Farmers Software and used multiple systems to manage customer information and database triggers. Some billing and daily deposit reconciliation. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing the customers. The toughest thing about the job was the lack of training and support from the manager (insurance agent)."
good,I was given more claims than you can handle and then berated by management for not completing all of your assignments in a given time. I worked over 90 hours a week keeping up with assignments.
good,"A good place to hone in on some accounting and customer-related skills while looking for FT work.  The hours are OK, there just is very little pay and even less room for growth."
good,all agents care about is money. if you make them alot of money they keep you. if not youre fired. this is not simple because they give you OLD leads and hardly anything to work with. find another job if you aren't licensed in insurance
good,"I love our clients, but the work is very cookie cutter and boring. My agent is a very nice person, but he's older and wants to retire and focus on other things."
good,Very unfortunate that they can not keep enough employees and they have a very high turn over rate.  Some people turn over to better positions.  The amount of claims though is never adjusted and it takes them 2-3 years to have an employee fully trained.
good,"Farmers could be a great place to work but maybe not the office in Fresno under the office manager. The training given is great however its very hard for a new employee to get 30 sales in 90 days or less. But the manager is expecting all new people to get those 30 sales, no matter what. If you do not get them then he will have no use for you. NO excuses it seems its all about the sales to him. When no ones gores out with you to show how its done you are expected to do it anyway."
good,Farmers seems to not have a clear understanding of what direction they are going and at the moment they are cutting employees with no real rhyme or reason other than to save money. Morale is low and people are jumping ship.
good,I would not recommend this company because they make it very hard to succeed with extreme and ever-changing rules. There is very little support provided and they are always lowering bonuses even when you perform well.
good,"Very nice guy, but was hard to work for. I liked what I did, was wanting to learn more about the job. He offered to train me and failed to do that. I decided to leave and find something where I could learn more and make good money."
good,"Being an independent agent has its rewards and challenges. You have the ability to own your agency. Additionally offers schedule flexibility. Farmers offers a subsidy program that assist with your career. Once subsidy has ended your income will come from insurance sales. Additionally if you haven't hit certain benchmarks you may be responsible for paying back the subsidy. If anyone is looking to become an agent, you will need to be willing to grind it out on a daily basis."
good,"While they like to say they follow Agile/SaFe, in fact, they do not.  Management simply wants to hear that everything is ""okay"" (e.g., Blue Sky) and when told about issues, do not really address them.  No autonomy or authority given to the Project Managers and that, is a problem!"
good,"Property and Casualty company plus life insurance"
good,"Farmers is a good place to work just not a good place for me."
good,The commission rate on sales was low so you were in a constant state of mild panic trying to build your business and pay your bills at the same time.  If you can make it 4 years with being broke it'll pay off in the end. I couldn't make it that long.
good,"Assisting clients is rewarding. However, there were few benefits aside from vacation. Pay was very low and advancement opportunities are limited.  Insurance rates aren't very competitive with other companies. This makes selling the products difficult."
good,"Too many number requirements.  The job is too stressfull.  They want you to see the clients as numbers, and I don't function like that.  I want to see the customers as people and treat them as such."
good,I opened and closed office 5 days a week. Handled almost all data entry answered phones and daily interaction with policy holders. Assisted the agent in all operations of the office.
good,"Great place to work if you aren't someone who wants to get things done quickly and wants to think out of the box.  Lots of meetings, red tape and lack of timely decisions.  Old school ""this is how we always did it"" mentality.  Not progressive at all..."
good,lack of career advancement and little effort is put into their interview process.  They talk about how they value you and your work life balance but when you need something or help leadership will drop the ball.
good,The work was great! The general upper management was not.   A typical day was never a typical day as the rules changed often.   I fully enjoyed my very smart co workers and my agents and felt that I made a great impact on their business.
good,"Walk into the office greet co-workers with a smile, sit down at my desk and begin smiling aand dialing searching for new prospects. Hardest part is getting to learn the comanies systems"
good,"A typical day at Farmers begins and ends with team work. This factor in particular was extremely helpful with managerial issues."
good,"Farmers is a good place for someone starting out of college, but the management and promotion system is a buddy system and if you don't ""drink the Farmers Kool-Aid"", you will be stuck for a VERY long time."
good,Overall a great company to work for.  Many changes in management and policies sometime makes the work environment stressful.
good,was on the phone all of the time not much luck getting the quotes needed though people were already a customer or they didnt want to change to farmers.
good,Nice people. A lot of cold calls. No benefits. Opportunities in getting licensed. Hardest part is closing sales. Good company but not a lot of opportunities for movement in agencies
good,"I worked at the Farmers Help Point for 12 1/2 years.  I learned a lot and had some great work experience.  I also had some good promotional opportunities.  My first 10 years were great."
good,Ethicon has excellent products and training for their employees!
good,"Can you say micromanagement, which is what all the managers are forced to do. If not they get cut, when I was working their; I saw about 1.5 to 2 employees get fired every month for not meeting some metrics. Such as audits that ARE cherry picked. With 3 audits under 95% you’re caned. Not a great feeling, this is a place with the largest revolving door I have worked at. The bonus is great, 10% of your salary. This if you make it out of their 6 month probation period where they can fire you without cause."
good,I like to keep myself busy and that wasn't the case here lack of work was an issue. poor direction from management even thought they were pleasant to talk to.
good,"•	Analyzed loss data to identify opportunities for loss reduction through consultation and preparing recommendations to achieve lower losses.    "
good,"Typical day consisted of Farmer's Agents calling in to make changes, get assistance with plans or to re-write plans. I learned a variety of coverages you can have on your auto, home and life insurance plans. Management did not work closely with employees. Co-workers were very friendly. Hardest part of the job was learning the different types of dollar amounts you can have on plans. I enjoyed the team I worked on the most."
good,I worked real hard at doing everthing that was needed of me when setting appointments or filing/re-filing. I was not compensated enough to really live in general though and the pay was very inconsistent.
good,Answer complex calls from both agents & customers regarding billing issues.  Find & correct any & all billing issues.  Provid Billing breakdowns of customer customer account via excell.
good,A typical day would be interacting with agents and making thousands of phone calls.  The staff was okay.  The hardest part of the job would be to meet quota for phone calls and enjoyable would be lunches and incentives
good,"Company handled BI and PD claims."
good,"Consistently recruiting candidates for only one position (Insurance Agent). Management preached that they preferred quality candidates over quantity, but this is simply not the case. Limited opportunities to advance."
good,A day at work was alright but there was always a problem with what you do wrong and not what you did right.
good,"The companies are all about more, more more and when it trickles down to the office staff, the expectation is that the staff will ""take it from there"" A typical day at work consisted of me updating files and making sales, while the agent drank wine went computer shopping. Not a very progressive or competitive company. And their commercials suck. Someone should buy them. I always enjoyed the customers....seldom were there any issues that couldn't be resolved. Farmers should find a way to update their ads. They are neither clever or cute."
good,"I spent two years there and it was very difficult to move up. There was not alot of opportunities for advancement. the money was ok, but even after advancements, the pay increase was so small, it made it hard to justify all your hard work. call centers are not great places for career advancements. even the top level performers would wait a handful of years before getting advancements they deserved."
good,"When our office was divided up and St. Louis took over the Property claims management side, everything started going disastrously south. Some very fine adjusters were targeted for ‘elimination’ for no decent reason, other than someone’s lust for power and ‘my way or the highway’ approach to management. The best word to describe the St. Louis involvement / experience was ‘toxic.’"
good,"Great program in theory, but the success of the program is highly dependent on market factors and on the competitive rate structure of Farmers in the area. Rates here are not competitive so it makes the success of the program tedious; very low closing percentages."
good,For what we did pay should have been much greater.  We covered about 38 states and we had to know a the required laws for each state. We were also very limited in what they allowed us to do.
good,"The job comes with many perks such as a great 401k (10% match) and decent benefits for health and dental. The stress can be a lot as the turn over is quite high in both field reps and office reps. We’ve seen a lot of people leave but not a lot new people came on to replace them. Due to the short staffing the work load is crazy at times and doesn’t feel sustainable at all. But if youre determined and have the fight in you to take work one day at a time you can be rewarded with a competitive salary, overtime and annual bonus when the company hits its goals"
good,"The company has good pay and benefits, but that is where the good ends. People are petty, passive aggressive and their policies in force are decking, causing cut bacns"
good,As one would imagine starting your own insurance agency from scratch takes true dedication and drive.  Farmers sets you up initially with a training course on the ins and outs of sales techniques but not so much on the nuts and bolts of insurance itself.  for a new to insurance agency owner they should focus their training more on the inter workings of the insurance industry to increase their agencies knowledge level from the beginning.
good,"After many years and several reorganizations, my job was finally eliminated.  In fact, most of the senior positions were eliminated.  So this would be a great place to get some experience but then move on to a place that would appreciate you."
good,"Caseload was extreme, with poor management and little or no support from supervisor. Toxic work environment. Incentives for management to overwork adjusters."
good,"Probably pretty similar to other insurance companies. Average pay, normal hours and small office work environment. The work that I did was easy and came with little stress"
good,"Why does it force me to write a review on all my jobs? I kind of got screwed a this one. I'm trying really hard not to be bitter about it, but I still a a little. It's depressing not having a job."
good,This was a start up business for the District Manager.  I helped put the office together.  I sent out emails to agents on a daily basis to see where they were on their sales and what they were doing.  I also provided them with leads for new clients.  I set appointments for interviews for new agent positions.  We received calls from customers who did not agree with policy changes which we had to explain what happened to their policy and why the changes were taking place.
good,"I worked for a Farmer's agent years ago. She introduced me to the insurance industry, and changed my life for the better. Although, this was a positive change in my life, I didn't see much benefit to being a captive agent."
good,Agents didn't know how to run their own businesses with would result in failure. I was very successful when I was able to be. I landed the biggest sale at headquarters and i was recognized with a plaque but no added compensation. Agents didn't know if they were coming or going. That is why it was stressful.
good,"Overall great learning experience but little room for growth. Customers can be friendly or irritated, rates go up constantly never down, selling to people who don't want to be sold to."
good,Management was not very understanding about needing to take time to visit doctors. They were not very patient when it came to needing to take a day off for health reasons such as cardiologist appointments.
good,"Commission rate was very low.  I wanted to work more in Customer Service, but my manager didn't want to pay for that. The company as a whole is good.  The insurance plans are good for the customers.  However, I couldn't afford to drive all over the state and make presentation to companies and not be paid adequately.."
good,"I like this company, and my boss. But since it's a small office, there is no Medical Insurance provided, and no 401k.  There is not much opportunity for growth."
good,Got stuck doing the exact same thing every single day with no hope of moving up. It became monotonous and boring so I would not suggest working there for a full time career
good,If you are looking for a career with this company you to be aware that you will need to invest a lot of your own money to be successful. If you plan on a career with Farmers It's best to buy an agency vs. build one from scratch.
good,"Farmers Insurance is changing the way they do business. Commissions are being cut by double digits. Farmers once was a top notch company to work for. Now with online business, Farmers is behind in technological advancements."
good,"Farmers is a great place to cut your teeth in the insurance industry. They invest a great deal of  time and money into employees, but unfortunately the company culture does not appear to value your contributions as much as the company would initially portray."
good,"I really loved working with customers and helping them find auto, commercial, life and home insurance. It was a bit harder to sell policies because of the higher pricing. I wish they had training for new employees which would have made more agents stronger and able to educate for the high pricing on policies."
good,"Don't go into the full time agent program without sufficient funds to support yourself while you build up a clientele.  If you have funds to live on and a large area of influence, and an extremely can-do attitude, you can succeed in this job.  If you are reluctant to sell to anyone and everyone, maybe concider something else.  You need to be all-in and believe in yourself or the stress may be too much."
good,I am looking at this job as a stepping stone. As I gain experience I will be looking to go to a broker. I want to work for a bigger company for room to advance my payroll.
good,Insurance industry isn't fun in general. you really have to have tough skin. If you don't you will not last long here. I pretty much had to deal with upset customers at all time.
good,You make your own schedule throughout the week and schedule accordingly. Volume is not steady as the majority of inspections deal with recent storms. Management doesn't notice you until something goes wrong.
good,Your success as an agent will depend on your manager and your drive. You must have some capital because there is no financial assistance to help you set up your office.
good,"Management style is based on fear for your position.  Very stressful environment as each month began a new period in which you had to prove yourself and if goals were not met, then your job was in jeopardy."
good,"Good vision within C level management but does not trickle down. "
good,Flexible hours. Nice co workers. Usually very busy throughout the day. Good with rewards and recognition of employees.
good,I was hired in 2011 by 21st century. 21st century was bought out by farmers insurance. My first 2 years I made close to $50k each year. The company has gone down hill. Barely making $30k a year now.
good,A typical day at work for me is managing the office going out a visiting new and existing businesses getting to know them and letting them know that we are here if we could be of service them. I really love helping customers figure out the best way to cover their assets and making sure that they can reasonably afford to keep the policies.
good,"Highly demanding job, long hours, little or no training from management given, no benefits after 8 years. Horrible management experience."
good,Farmers as a whole is an okay company to work for but some of the supervisors are micro managers who at the same time do not provide a clear direction of expectations when asked
good,"great opportunity, if you have money to invest in adds and leads"
good,"Took on a role of many while working there from recruiter, manager, IT person, Admin, Customer Service and so on. I never saw my pay increase although I did see my work load increase significantly."
good,Difficult work life balance. CEO has lost his way and is tanking the company. Stressful work environment. Good benefits and 401k matching is 6%. More and more going away from local reps and going to large offices that handle a large territory. There is movement within the company and it's parent but you need to be cut throat. Plan on a 60-80 hr work week.
good,"Overall the company is great, but the management needed some help with direction and leadership."
good,"For the majority of the day, I was given lists of cold calls and sat in the office continuously leaving messages on answering machines."
good,"Contacts potential prospects using scripts provided by the agent. Works directly with an "
good,"Over all a good place to work, but problems with the management team and how major changes are implemented."
good,"great start office job learn a lot about the insurance business, short temp employment would have love to grow."
good,"Working in a call center environment and having peers around you that don't have the same work ethic is frustrating.  I tend to block it out and do the right thing for the customer.  When I see something that is not right or ethical, I have no problems reporting it.  I look for the best interest of the company and the customer.  I treat the customer in the manner in which I wish to be treated."
good,since it was a small business that was bearly staring it needed alot of organizing and my job was to work on their financial book.
good,Previously worked for AIG unfortunatley got laid off due to the buy out.
good,In this job one has to focus on the job so no mistake are made on customers account.
good,This company was great to work for. I worked a call center in Olathe Kansas filing claims. It was about making the customer happy and satisfied. Quality over Quantity. Then along came a new North American CEO who decided Quantity was more important when it came to making customers happy. A lot of great workers were fired because of the sudden change. More still are trying to get out because they are unhappy.
good,"As an office manager for a insurance agent and an owner who had several different small business as well, i was responsible for several different tasks. On a typical day i would supervise one employee and assist with a heavy calendar for the owner. I was responsible for balancing the books and payroll as well as contacting new and previous clients in order to keep business flowing. The hardest part was balancing the many different businesses and being the direct contact person.  The work ethics of the owner were not as good as I would like because he was very unorganized and never really mastered anything. The hardest part was dealing with disappointments from the clients because they felt treated unfairly.  The most enjoyable part was learning to plan high dollar events for the owner as well as having access to many prestigious people in the community.  "
good,"Do not ever apply for a Customer Service Associate unless you want to bring crumbs home to your family, have to work weekends and unconventional hours.  Your treated like a robot!  Heard the rest of the positions in the company have great reviews but stay far away from the Help Point!  Everyone loathes coming into work! "
good,This is a great opportunity for someone who is self driven and doesn't need a lot of training. 
good,"Honestly if I was giving a review of the people I worked w/ - I would have given five stars across the board.  But because I have to review the entire company including they way they treat customers and their employees - I couldn't wholeheartedly give anything more than a middling rating."
good,I have enjoyed my career with this company. Moving laterally has been relatively easy give you a wide variety of options however it has been difficult to seek advanced opportunities do to re-organization of the company.
good,Everyday was an adventure. I meet new people to introduce my product to and nurtured old relaionships to build upon existing policies in place. I created my own success at price. As a business owner I was responsible for the staffs lively hood. I was the person to make or break the business. Every expense was paid by my agency. so it can be very scary at first.
good,"Sure there's a STIP bonus in March but that's slowly going away. Salary increases are based on tests that you can only take if the office unanimously approves you. If one supervisor is against you promoting, you're stuck. The company is downsizing but still has money to try building Farmers Field? Some management truly feels dedicated and on your side but the company is quicksand. Beware of the promises they make when they put out an offer for hire. They're empty."
good,Manage direct reports in the assessment of claims
good,Hard to contact Trainers and support staff. Not enough hands on training.
good,"Things started well. I have learned so much about the industry and always felt like a productive member of the team. However, recent decisions made my the high level representatives have made everyday that passes more difficult. Expectations are beyond reach and the work load has become unmanageable. Management protects themselves and leaves the people doing the hard work hanging out to dry. Ive gone from being excited about the future to dreading the next day. They say if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. No doubt about it, I work everyday. They set you up to fail, and that's no way to run a company."
good,"I was a back up to the producing agent. I relieved him at lunch and helped cross sell products, customer service, and took payments in the office when needed. I didn't do much at this position but learned how Farmers worked and what their coverages were."
good,"Typical day at work was I opened office, checked messages, returned calls, checked emails, assisted customers with payments and questions regarding their insurance policies. I was the only employee there besides the agent. I learned more about auto and home insurance. I managed the office when agent was out. The hardest part of the job was that agent was rarely there and some customers needed to speak specifically to him about other financial services that he provided."
good,"Good place to work, but while I was there insurance rates were high and increased the difficulty to sell the product."
good,"Claims is a very stressful job due to the workload.  From what I hear, that is not unique to Farmers Insurance.  Overtime is often worked.  High turnover, so there is always more work than the department can handle reasonably."
good,"The field adjuster's scope is getting smaller and being phased out.  I would travel the state handling auto claims from the initial inspection through repair.  The hardest part of the job is you are often defending yourself against the company, the shops, and the insured/claimant.  The pay would have been better if I would have taken tests to advance, but I found a different career before completing the tests."
good,"Being with Farmers for almost 8 years, I have seen a significant shift in its culture to one that no longer seems to care as much about employees as profit. They continue to drive ""innovation"" as a way to get employees to do more with the same amount of pay and do not recognize high performance, or do so in a limited way."
good,"The company is great.  Training and support are good.  Not for you if you just want a regular paycheck.  This is a commission only job.  If you are good in sales, this is for you."
good,"The job was great up until a certain point when I could do it anymore. I was enjoyable for the most part the coworkers were nice, and the job was very competitive."
good,Insurance is a tough industry.  The pay isn't great and management sometimes will just purge employees to try to change things up.  If you decide to become an agent prepare to work your butt off for not a lot of money.
good,Claims Customer Service is a highly micromanaged position. On the plus side it's a 24/7 position so nights and evenings are always hiring.  Getting to a day shift or a different position within the company can be difficult
good,The bottom line was how many auto did you quote...quote more ...you then write more.   REALLY!  Farmers is largely non-competitive currently.  I hope things change. They lack flexibility and up to date technology.  It is unfortunate.
good,"Supervisors seem to hang out at their position until they are dinosaurs. No motivation, drive, or ambition. Great career for someone willing to chase the carrot dangled in front of your face until you retire. Your salary will keep you just above broke."
good,"AT this time I have no comment, due to just resign.  I have to time to think of my career with Farmers . I know I will not go back this time.I the old day the company was for the agency but now they are all bottom line"
good,"Its a job if you want a steady paycheck. There is hardly any room to develop or advance."
good,"Working at Farmers will teach you a lot, however you will not be able to make your own decisions.  You will be micromanaged abut everything, and will have to deal with the manager never being able to admit his mistakes."
good,"Reviewing all Life insurance cases for the state of NJ"
good,"Worked on contract for an Independent Agent of Farmers as a Producer."
good,"You have the opportunity to own your own business with the support of a large company. I can be really tough at first, but if you can stick with it, and adapt, you might make it."
good,"They just couldn't figure out how to keep their productive employees happy. They would work you to the bone and have no qualms about hiring a new employee to replace you. They did not want you working overtime and yet would pile on more work than anyone could do in an 8-hour work day. They treated 'inside adjusters' as second-rate to the field positions. They did, however provide fair pay and good benefits if you can put up with all of the above issues and more. They have a decent game room if you could ever spare more than 30 seconds to use it."
good,Desirable work environment office setting. I learned a considerable amount of customer service. The most difficult part of the job was convincing customers to purchase insurance policies. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers resolve their issues or concerns.
good,"Fun environment to work in, lots of great people.  Rates are not competitive enough and they focus on selling value.  Pay changes are always in place.  But I did learn a lot and I enjoyed working with my colleagues and the learning opportunity was amazing."
good,"I was an captive insurance agent, responsible for attaining minimum sales quotas each month. You have to be self motivated to make sure you met and exceeded your sales quotas. You would be paid for your sales, but if the customers cancelled their insurance before their renewal date, the difference would be deducted from your commissions"
good,"it was a pleasure to work for that company. Ive learned a lot, and it  helped my through life challenges. Great experience working with people and insurance companies."
good,I learned that this is a tough business and not for the faint of heart.  This review is not objective due to there being so many different factors involved and all positions have different goals.
good,"If your proclivities and abilities are more toward general business rather than technical disciplines, it might be a good place for you.  It merely was not a good match for me."
good,Very competative. Need to work hard to advance. Very hard to get started but if you make it through that it is a great business with lots of chance to advance.
good,"I enjoyed learning and working in the Insurance industry; however, it was very stressful, very long hours and I worked on commission. They put me in the office all by myself with very little insurance knowledge and basically told me good luck."
good,Insurance was not an industry that fit with me or my personality. Plenty of people do well in the industry but I am not a slaesman and do not enjoy that line of work.
good,"They are more loyal to the agents then they are their own employees. I had an agent, screaming and cussing at me, but I was apparently supposed to sit there and take that abuse. If you can handle people screaming, cussing and abusing you on the phone then this is the company for you. The pay isn't that bad and the vacation days are plenty with the option to earn more. However, all the supervisors are not experienced and they don't always handle situations appropriately. My only advice is if you can handle being on the phone all day and being screamed at, then this is the place for you."
good,There is a whole new change in management. New management is unrealistic and very subjective and their performance reviews.  PTO is very generous. Salary is good to
good,This is very easy job as far as labor but its mentally stressful and when a employee point out ways to improve your voice goes unheard. It is really hard to prove excellent service without the tools needed.
good,"There are many positive aspects to working for Farmers Insurance but the quantity over quality approach to handling claims investigations has been very disconcerting over the years.The typical day involves receiving up to 4 different assignments, all from different lines of business, and investigating the noted indicators. The direct management team is very supportive but have little power or say in the day to day operations. The hardest part of the job is the dealing with the high volume of investigations as there is very little concern for work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work from home and the daily field work."
good,"Farmers is not family oriented, lots of the employee perks have been removed, good chance that certain locations will be closing.  Stressful work environment."
good,it was my first office work because i was working like a cleaning lady for 3 last years. I wanted to change something in my life so I went to school and I took Office Assistant certificate. After that I found this work and it was great but i was moving and i could't work there.
good,I have heard different stories about Farmers but when i started it was hard. i didn't get any help for my superiors on training or working with potential customers. i Had to start my own insurance company basically on my own.
good,"I was a claims rep in total loss, auto.  It is a stressful job."
good,"Most of the time doing customer service work, answering about 50-100 phone calls a day. "
good,A typical work day involves a lot of meetings and hands on work. There is not much learning however and growth in position is limited to those who brown nose and are close to the higher up's. Hard work is rarely appreciated or rewarded
good,With the company reducing compensation rates and struggling to adapt to an online market it's only a matter of time before agencies become obsolete.  If FIG corporate has observed this they aren't exactly being forthcoming with their agents.  Unless an agent has strong support from his/her district manager it will be sink or swim without a life jacket.  This is a captive carrier so know freedom to write business through another insurance company; your agency is a slave to the rates.  I suggest going independent if you must enter the very volatile insurance industry.
good,"It was a good working experience at Farmers. I learn a lot as a licensed insurance agent from maintaining existing accounts, How to build business and providing excellent customer service."
good,"This was my first home based call center experience. Although it not that big and the salary was average, I was able to talk to people of different cultures for the very first time."
good,"It was a good company, I learned a lot, but there was no growth or pay advance. There was always something new to do and follow up, but once you reach the top there is no growth."
good,"Farmers is offering a very good homeowners, boats, motorcycles, commercial products, competitive to others. But as long for commercial lines they do have a very high professional skills underwritings, so than for personal lines included life products is TERRIBLE. The level of underwriters professional skills is discounting, they don't use commonsense in decision making, only guidelines, which is horrible."
good,"I was on phones all day talking mostly to agents-sometimes to the insureds and making changes to policies or discussing eligibility.  I learned a lot about insurance but there was always more to learn and they frequently changed products, so you had to learn all over again about the new product.   I enjoyed management for the most part-they were helpful till this last supervisor I had who was negative frequently and didn't give positive feedback.  Hardest part of job was getting questions you never had before even though you've been on the job 8 years.   Hard to find answers using their search engine.  Helping agents find correct answers to their questions and educating them on how to find the answers themselves was the most enjoyable part."
good,Telemarketing/marketing & being in constant contact with potential prospects. This job requires time to build upon the client base. management within the company of farmers is supportive.
good,lot of vendors. Trying to blame each other resources. but lots of learning. overall not bad. But is not great when it comes to pay especially in CA.
good,"Huge work load with very little pay. Did not feel valued as an employee. On a positive note, there was a lot learned and there was never a slow boring day."
good,"Typically, a claims adjuster will handle 1-3 claims per day depending on the amount of claim volume. Claims vary in complexity. However, there is also a wealth of ""post claim"" tasks that have to be handled in between claim inspections."
good,"I have worked with Farmers for the last 10 years as an automobile claims adjuster. I have developed my skills in handling conflict, serving customers, and solving problems. Like in any company, the goals and purposes of the company seem to change regularly. There is no clear defined purpose, goal, or way of doing things. The people in management positions are friendly, but there is little to no opportunity for professional or salary advancement. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with angry or unreasonable customers. The best part of the job is interacting with fellow employees."
good,"The work would feel less daunting if we were compensated better. Being a claims Customer Service Rep and taking back-to-back calls eight hours straight is stressful. You are dealing with everything from routine fender benders to highly complex claims. You are the ""frontline"" and have many metrics to be accountable for, yet you are given entry-level pay. "
good,great work enviorement fast paced must be able to multi tasks must be customer orientated must be friendly able to catch on quickly must be computer knowledge .
good,"I worked for Farmer's Insurance for nearly a year, but in all honesty, their rates were super high and could not come close to being competitive with several of the other major insurance companies.  So I went independent, so that I could work with many companies in order to provide the best rates and polices to the public."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, and I loved the type of work I did. My coworkers were true professionals who worked well together and always wanted to produce quality to work to exceed the expectations of their customers. The culture handed down through top leadership could be healthier, however."
good,"Arrive and start your shift, check your email for the count of your work.  Depending on how much work there is, you may be sent home early.  Management only works in the daytime, so I don't see them as I work the evening shift. My co-workers are very friendly.  The hardest part of my job is processing one document every eight seconds or less, even if you receive more than one document and have to separate by the Document Type, no talking.  Training class was not informative.  The most enjoyable part is, listen to your music through your headphones, wear jeans Monday-Friday, no weekends."
good,"This job was incredibly boring. The hours are not good. This company does have some good qualities. If you like to sit down and be bored all day then this will work for you,but if you like to be up and about i would'nt recommend it."
good,"Lots of filing, answering phones, and data entry. I learned a great deal of customer service. Management was OK, could have been better organized at this particular office. The hardest part of the job was learning the system and finding out the best option for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer by finding them the best deals."
good,Experience depends on the local agent. Mine was not the best. Good luck!
good,"Recruiting, and driving sales is all day everyday. I work in a fast pace high stress field that requires a lot of me."
good,"Calling potential clients to offer business."
good,"Great for self starters who are willing to invest their own money and time to build a solid business long term."
good,"It is a very busy place and requires someone who is willing to be glued to his/her desk. You are expected to participate in the office activates but are shamed if you fall back on work. There is very little room for error; it is a rare occasion to see people helping each other, if you are behind watch out because your name is going on a list. All in all it only a good place because of the benefits and to get your foot in the door."
good,There are plenty of resources to be successful. You must also try and invest in the business if you want to succeed. Those who spend more time marketing and going business to business will succeed. You must be willing to live on Ramen for several years before it will start to kind of pay-off. Tough!
good,i am the only csr and we are in a small town we get busy but most the time we are not
good,"When I started premiums weren't bad, but in the last few months it is so hard to beat other companies.  We are not only more, but 2 to 3 times more.  We are pushed to get customers, but we are way to high and on top of that they care more about money then the customers."
good,The pay was decent but the major problem was management and disorganization. They didn't have a good structure. It seems like things are improving.
good,"I would help the current customers with any questions or changes they needed. I would sell auto, home, life, business, workers compensation insurance. I would cold-call new prospectives."
good,Farmers Insurance Group was a nice company to work for but I had to leave due to medical problems.
good,"Managing customer accounts, sales, sales calls, cold calls. Inspecting insurance needs & risk management"
good,Typical day was to go in and sit down at a cubicle doing nothing but phone calls. I learned to be patient with people over the phone and that communication is crucial no matter what you're going into.
good,If you rock out your job as I do and have a low inventory then you get to do more work than your co-workers that can not keep up. Yet I do not get a portion of their salary and we make the same amount??? I am tired of being taken advantage of for my efforts.
good,Fast pace as an independently owned insurance agent. Training program is excellent.
good,The Farmers Family is really family. They make you feel like you have been friends for years.
good,"The job pays fairly well for the kind of work you are doing.  It does require a lot of Insight and it takes time to know the vast field of information you need as there are a lot of intricacies with insurance.  All of this I fine and farmers does the best they can however it is a call center and you are there to solve peoples problems, often these people are not happy.  If you have issue with your mental health I would not recommend a call center environment.  It has personally caused me no shortage of stress anxiety.  The company espouses the important of mental health but if you are not within certain parameters with their date set on their spread sheets you are more or less threatened to be more efficient or be let go.  Long story short they preach a game about caring about mental health but don't really."
good,"You are on your own most of the time"
good,Worked to build business with little compensation. Seldom recognized for  bringing in new client/prospecting.  Not much room for career growth unless you are the business owner.
good,"Great company, hard to advance career. Excellent benefits and work life balance. Also great bonuses that rewards job performances.  Very organized with claim system."
good,"This job is definitely great for transitioning to start a small insurance office. This was a great experience for me, in terms of exposure to insurance. This helped me understand exactly how to manage people and tailor insurance policies for customers."
good,"I like working for the company, however, every Agency is different. Some will be very good to work at and some will be a bad experience. I personally have had issues with some Agents because they don't want to pay or they expect you to do way more than what you should, but if you have a good teamwork that shouldn't be an issue."
good,"I didn't care for the ultra-micro managing, the shift bids (and ending up stuck with work hours and days off I didn't like), the non-stop calls (its a call-center), people quitting non-stop, managers who are on your butt constantly, and having your job duties constantly changed (having to do more than what you were hired for). The benefits and pay are really good - but that's about all."
good,"Working at Farmers isn’t the best job but it puts food on the table. The training is ok but for my district the district manager is an a** and he admits it himself. If you work with Farmers, make sure you find an agent that is willing to push you to a promotion or open an agency, because mine doesn’t want that and that kills worker productivity. Overall, not a bad company but certainly not that good. I’m trying to leave ASAP"
good,"The hours were flexible. The enviroment was structured. Management was willing to help me learn and answered questions openly if I was having a difficult time. Often times, the job could be overwhelming with high call volumes."
good,"Not a lot of room for growth, hard to deal with at times, have to know how to deal with aggravated customers, good pay, have an hour lunch, pretty understanding with kids"
good,"I spent 7 years here and just about every type of experience one can have; good, bad, etc. Pay is low for the amount of work requested in return. Vacation time is liberal and encouraged to be taken. In the end I left because the office management became too political and the only people making advancements were in a superior's back pocket. They also heavily play favorites."
good,"The agency was basic, salary below expectations. No culture and investment in the business. work was redundant. Customer service was and customer contact was minimum."
good,They should improve their education and orientation process.  Very mundane and time consuming without much benefit.  Old marketing tactics and not open to suggestions.
good,"Farmers is a fast paced work environment with demanding time management skills. "
good,"Farmers is a good company to work for. Their premiums and expectations are pretty high, but overall it's still decent. Depending on the agent you work for I am sure."
good,"Sales driven culture, not as concerned about the employee.  You could work as hard as you wanted to achieve the goals.  The most rewarding piece of the job was the rewards that could be received based on performance."
good,Farmers is a good company to work for if you a self starter. Management is very busy and they don’t have a lot of time for employees. You need to be able to work independently without needing much direction.
good,Employment was mostly contract work. On call to fix any technical problems that occurred. Most of the problems involved system restores due to employees using work machines for personal use.
good,"I would look up resumes on online sites such as monster, indeed, and other sites. I then contacted them via telephone and emails to set up an interview to meet with my manager to become a sales agent. I loved my manager, he was great, but I hated the women that worked there. They are catty, childish, act like high school students, go into each others offices and chat about everything but work when the head boss isn't there."
good,"I was an agent, so had my own  office. My work schedule would  vary based on customer. I was an agent for 13 yrs and am now looking to do something else that will be a new learning experience."
good,Company was not looking out for the growth of their agents.  Multiple rate increases for the customer and reduced commissions to the agent did not promote growth or advancement
good,"Farmers gives you decent compensation and a good benefits/PTO package. The company does suffer from antiquated technology and a management culture that's far removed from the day to day to reality. Company is in constant flux and suffers greatly from managerial decisions that use employees to work out issues as opposed to properly vetting and testing ideas and processes prior to release, when issues are discovered the company is painfully slow in implementing solutions. "
good,"If you know the right people, kiss the right butt, and are prepared to move around you can promote up pretty quick.  The company is horrible about hiring claims managers/supervisors with minimal experience.  I had at least 2 managers over a 7 year span that were hired with 1-3 years of claims handling experience."
good,no room for advancement unless you want to become a licensed agent which I had no desire to do because during the few years I worked there I seen many agents come and go
good,"a typical day at work is working with people to help with their insurance needs  sales solving problems and learning new tasks."
good,"It's hard working for a senior agent/owner who don't appreciate those who exceed their goals and coddle those who don't. I pride myself with my work ethic and it bothers me that someone who has none gets away with tardiness everyday, doing nothing but texting on their phone & stealing accounts only to fall short of her monthly quota.  When she messes up  the manager admonishes everyone except her."
good,We had printing down to a science at our Chino facility and they decided to move everything to Grand Rapids which they didn't even have mail piece tracking. Looks like Farmers is reinventing the wheel.
good,"After constantly trying to meet or exceed their standards, I was rated poorly.   "
good,This particular location was not for me. I advise whom ever works with a famers insurance agency they make sure that the owner has his values for the company right and not be non-appreciated.
good,"The job itself and the people are awesome - however the continuous uncertainty is extremely stressful and creates problems with work life balance.  The stress culture however it is more about the company than the people.  There is an obvious unbalanced relationship between employer and employee. Leadership is more in for themselves and not the the folks doing the work.  "
good,"Too Network Marketing like. It seemed, as though, the management's sole purpose was to make money off of recruitment rather than focusing on preparing new agents for success on their own."
good,"I spent most days by myself in a very small office of an agent.  I did not receive much training and was being pushed into more of a sales position, which I was not interested in."
good,Requires getting out and talking to people and bugging them about coming in to get a quote. Also you have to take getting griped out when their prices go up. Wasn't for me at all.
good,Many different authority heads all asking for different things. No one treated each other well and the environment was not productive. No organization.
good,there are lots changes and instability in the office. the jobs in florida are being moved to other states. the employees are fantastic. They are resilient and are making the most of the situation.
good,"This job turned out to be one of the hardest I had ever had.  The test we had to take to become licensed insurance brokers was tough.  I scored in the 90's on my test but once we were put on the phones, we felt totally inadequate.  I hated the shift I had been given.  I worked M-F from 12:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.  Since my husband had a regular working job from 8-5, this interfered with our family time.  Most of the people that were hired with me were young people who didn't mind working holidays or weekends to earn extra money.  "
good,"Customer Service and sales done every day; worked with every client the agency had established and continued to bring into the business; management was new to the insurance business and did not have the background to substantially run an insurance agency; hardest part of this job was to balance customer service, brining in new business and train the owner about insurance and how to run the business so it would be successful;  enjoyed making things work for customers and giving them the confidence that "
good,Farmers offers no benefits to its employees even though they sale insurance. Leaving for Benefits. Farmers always takes rate increases. It's hard to keep customers with the rates always going up.
good,"This job started out well, but then after a while the boss I had told me that she could not afford to pay me anymore and then I never got my last two weeks salary."
good,Unless you are the Agent and basically your own boss with Farmers it isn't a job i would suggest. If you have your license and don't have someone you have to answer to every day it is a job that you can make a lot of money doing and have tons of free time on the side.
good,"Founded in 1928"
good,Farmers is focusing on channeling claims to streamline process.  This means that there are less claims for field claims reps to work.  Additionally the claims left for the field to work are far more complicated.
good,"As a scratch agent not knowing the game it is hard to hit the numbers you have to meet, they are a little bit out of the reach of a lot of people.  You must be willing to sit at a desk for hours on end making cold calls."
good,The company was failing when I started working there. The boss never guided me in any way. He was on the phone all the time and could not answer simple questions.
good,"Everyone had a smile on at most times of the day, even when the training was taking place. However, the training material on certain products was a little out-dated."
good,I have been with Farmers for a little over 5 years and have witnessed nepotism and unethical work culture. Employees are encouraged to work from home as a company policy but is frowned upon by leadership. Lots of politics and favoritism. Some departments also have racism to a certain degree.
good,The office I worked in had a good vibe and I enjoyed the other staff members. Premiums continue rising and it became more and more difficult to write new business and retain existing business.  No hard feelings but I would not work there again.
good,"Felt like i was in a college fraternity. No advancement in my former geographical area. Long hours but great pay based on your performance. Enjoyed traveling to Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis, and Orlando. Enjoyed dressing and wearing suits."
good,Training taught you how to test for your adjuster license. Once out of training it seemed that depending on who you got as a supervisor you would sick or swim. Your reviews were based on surveys done by email. If the customer didn't use email it hurt your chances at good reviews and a raise.
good,"Management changes are very persistent, work culture is okay and I enjoy working with different functional areas. Job security is very hight, if you are able to keep your skills up"
good,"I personally didn't have a great experience working for the company and it's manager, company is not structured for success, weak customer service department."
good,"When it comes to rates, Farmers is generally not the most competitive, so selling value is more difficult compared to other companies. Service is sub-par so high premiums may not necessarily reflect the quality of service."
good,"We strive to make sure all customers are happy and cared for.  From day one, the message was to look for coverage, pay what we owe, no more no less.  I appreciate a company that looks for coverage and wants to treat customers the way we should."
good,"No security, no long term plans. I've learned a few things in this office, but not trained only teaching myself. I have enough experience to have adapted and follow my steps in this positon, but I need something with more establisment. I'm not mirco managed at all which is good. However, I find myself that I need a but more of a challenge and more growth."
good,Small office. Its not bad to work at. However i just graduated and am looking for somewhere i can advance my career. there is not much room for advancement here.
good,Largely disorganized and unproductive.  Low moral due to upper level management.  Co-workers mostly fun and knowlegable.  Clients are easy to work with.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty fast paced, due to the fact that the office was pretty busy. I have learned so much about insurance in the past few months it's unbelievable."
good,"Farmers offers decent pay and benefits, especially for recent college grads. However, it is a large corporate culture for better or worse. Too many executives whose primary objective seems to be justifying their salaries. Advancement is based more on political skill than any understanding of the insurance business much less any decision making ability. What's worse is most managers are constantly looking over their shoulders due to non-stop right sizing. This trickles down and causes a very negative office atmosphere. The unwritten rule is ""he who names the problem is the problem"". Most employees do their best just to keep their heads down and avoid being noticed."
good,"Commission only which can be very trying and difficult. Its either something you can handle or you can't, there is no in between."
good,"As an agent, you are not an employee of the company, however they treat you like one. You are independent. You are 100% commission based. Sell more, Make more! All expenses are out of your pocket. If you want freedom with a lot of stress, become an insurance agent for FIG."
good,A good insurance company with diverse employee base to meet customer needs 24/7 by offering multiple opportunities for customers to meet their insurance needs.
good,"Enjoyed coworkers.  Provides structure that you don't see at a lot of companies. Training could be better.  Very ""clique-ish'"
good,"Log into the computer and begin the day by answering incoming phone calls from third parties and clients about accidents and incidents that occur to their vehicles or properties."
good,"The people there are great. However, there isn't a lot of support for the beginner agent in establishing clients and moving forward within the company."
good,"Enjoyed working on telecom billing and research of wireline inventory. Conversion projects for Bullseye and Granite Telecom helped create the wireline database. "
good,Select opportunities may be available for credible candidates. There are some excellent leaders and managers.  There are tenured executives in the company who are not productive or competent.
good,growth opportunity within the company and they provide quarterly raises.
good,"Typical day consisted of processing leads to find viable clients.Collecting information in order to create initial quotes in order to make a pitch.Calling prospective clients in order to set up a face to face meeting, Using information gained from face to face to create custom insurance package for the client."
good,Very stable with good benefits.  Good organization to work for overall.
good,I was able to take a few classes that the company offered. I enjoyed the people and customer service.
good,"Wonderful company, good hours, good stability. Very little room to advance your career here."
good,"Dependable employees"
good,Best part of this job is getting to talk to people on the phone and trying to get the problem fixed. Very nice environment
good,"great time off very boring work weekends off, never work past 8pm good managers bad traning"
good,Small office but it keeps us busy the whole day.  My co-workers and I work as a team and that makes everything smooth.
good,"I balance and cashbox daily, process payments answer incoming calls and emils, handle service requests.  I learned about insurance coverage and who needs what. My co-workers have been many in my few years there. It is only me and another part time person. We recently hired a marketer and a producer and I have 2 bosses. The hardest part of my job is working for 2 seperate people who like things handled differently. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers all day long.  I love talking to people and helping them learn things that they do not know."
good,good company to work for...  Some good years and other not so good
good,"A typical day at work would include answering the phone and walk-in customers, conducting interviews for agents, CSR's, marketers and agency producers, recruiting, meetings with the agents to consult on a weekly basis, marketer training and coaching at nights, studying for the series 6, 63 & 26."
good,"When i worked for farmers insurance as an intern it was fairly slow-paced. I would shread and file documents, do light cleaning, call transfers and general office work. I would also occasionally translate quotes and policies for customers as needed. Manegment was helpful and kind but seemed overwhelmed. My only co worker was also my supervisor and was very detail oriented and was able to teach me many things from how to tranfer calls to how to use thier typewritter. The hardest part of the job was not being able to advance in the company due to the maneger haveing no extra funds. I really enjoyed working with the customers and finding the right policy for each individual."
good,Several departments have moved out of the Illinois location to larger regional offices in other states.  
good,"Great co-workers, easy hours, consistent income, worked mainly on the phone, with clients, and was the office assistant. "
good,"I’m responsible for profitable growth of Property/Casualty and Workers Compensation business.I evaluate commercial business for risk acceptability-matching price to exposure, loss frequency and severity for profitability and rating."
good,"I was the office manager/assistant/sales person. I pretty much wore a lot of hats wuth this job. I manage my boss' schedule, clients payments and policies keeping them up to date and also working on quotes and selling them. I had an awesome boss and anagement as a whole."
good,"It was a good experience for retail, selling insurance. I really not into forcing people to buying anything. I learned that it is best that you have some time of insurance in case of serious emergency or death. You want to protect your love ones before it is too late."
good,Farmers Insurance Group has excellent training courses for the agents and they are there to support you along the way when you are financially unstable with your business. Excellent management at the district office and they treat you like one of them the moment that you walk into the office.
good,"Investigating, evaluating and settling injury claims. Working with customers face to face. Co-workers are great people; smart, friendly, helpful, and team-oriented. Balancing workload is difficult from day to day, making it difficult to effectively plan for the day. Flexibility is the most enjoyable part of the job, being able to occasionally work from home and not tied to a time card."
good,I would only do an agency if I was single again. It's alot of work because it's all on you. The biggest downfall is you have no control over the rates.
good,"I learned about insurance in general and proper insurance coverage. I handled commercial lines which involved insuring companies, homeowners associations and commercial business and also did personal lines which involved insuring autos, homes, motorcycles and any other recreational vehicles. In this insurance agency I was giving the opportunity to handle tough, in depth insurance situations. I was also able to learn more about the computer system, customer service and answering phone calls."
good,I worked for Farmers prior to being transitioned to a call center. We were all laid off and given only one option-to be a call center agent. The morales and values decreased dramatically and customer service went down hill. Management changed and made it almost impossible to enjoy the workplace any longer.
good,This was my first job fresh out of college. I really didn't know what to expect. It was a good place to test out my knowledge and get comfortable writing web apps.
good,"Assist Home Policy Holders with new claims regarding damaging to home and contents. Direct callers to adjusters handling claims for Farmers, Foremost, and Bristol West insurance companies, customer service, and New Claims."
good,"A normal day at work is checking voicemail, calling clients back, checking emails and responding to them. Giving quotes to potential clients over the phone and online. Answer any questions clients and potential clients might have. Cold call potential clients."
good,"A typical day at work involves sitting for 7.5 hours in front of a computer screen, taking back to back calls from customers who have either gotten in accident, have damage to their home or if their property has caused damage to someone else property."
good,Well i worked during the week everyday at 1:00 and learned a hole lot about documents like legal lawsuits work comp and titles.
good,I like the job it is challenging but not very secure. I make lots of phone calls. I have learned that people don't really like to switch insurance companies even if you are saving them money. Not too many co-workers. The hardest part of the job is calling people. I enjopy it when I do sell a policy.
good,The department I was in was new to the company & unfortunely fortune the heads of the department didn’t know how to run that part of Farmers. It was learn as you go.
good,"Having worked for Farmers Insurance for over 15 years in the claims department I can testify to the rapid decline in the corporate culture in the last decade. There was a time when you could listen to the CEO get up and say ""at Farmers, our people make the difference"" and truly believe what you were hearing. Now, you can substitute the word ""numbers"" for ""people"" and would be more on point. From my perspective (and many of my ex-colleagues who also worked for many years with me), Farmers has forgotten the very people who helped make the company what it once was. The training is noteworthy and the salary and benefits are among the upper end of the industry. Unfortunately, all of this does not make up for the shortcomings in basic management skills in the workplace. Hopefully, Farmers will eventually return its focus to the people who strive each day to bring about the results it sometimes ruthlessly pursues. Then it will no longer just be a large company but will return to being a great company."
good,"It is a typical field claims position.  There is opportunity for advancement, especially if you live in one of the hub cities of Grand Rapids, MI, Olathe, KS, Phoenix, Az"
good,"typical cubicle job, management is very nit-picky and will look at everything you do. they track the amount of bathroom breaks you take and record every call and criticize you over mistakes. pay is ok and if you're new hours are usually bad. training is fun though."
good,"I was with the company for just over 3 years. In that time, the culture steadily declined. They put more and more on the adjusters plate to handle and kept reducing the work force to the point that those left were always on the hunt for a way out to get out of the negativity that had been fostered and having to give self pep-talks before even walking through the doors in the morning."
good,"I was an employee with Farmers for over 10 years and I worked in 5 different departments. My biggest piece of advise to anyone seeking employment here is to move around often. Do not stay in any position for over 2 years. Also, be prepared to be stressed out especially if you are handling more complex claims such as field auto or property claims. If you suffer from anxiety and cannot handle stress well, this is absolutely not the job for you. I think that it is imperative that an employee working here has a strong support system because there will be days that you come home and all you need is a big bear hug. "
good,The agent I worked for was really unorganized and she micromanaged everything. And she would not take responsibility if something went wrong. And she was rude to a lot of the customers if they had more questions.
good,"It was my temporary job, and I enjoyed to learn a new skills. That was experience to work with people, solved some problems, and answer the questions,"
good,"My position transitioned to the parent company, Zurich Insurance, where the management style changed significantly. The Zurich CRE team was not well managed."
good,"The people that make up the organization are great. The friendships made over time last beyond the years of employment and are the best part of the experience. The employee group is often referred to as the ""Farmers Family"" and it is indeed true."
good,It was very slow because I had limited access to things and did not get enough training. Boss was a family friend therefor he was not professional at the appropriate times
good,"I have worked for Farmers for over 10 years and the most important advice I can give to a person starting off here is to change positions and move to different departments once every 3-4 years bare minimum . I do not care if you like your current role, it will change for the worst eventually and you will end up kicking yourself for not getting out sooner. The key to moving around is to find a mentor in the department you want to move to and schedule shadowing sessions where you can learn more about the role. Rarely do people interview for a different department the 1st time and get hired on. The hiring manager wants to see that you did your research and by shadowing it shows that you really want the position. If you don’t move around every 3 to 4 years you might as well quit because you will find yourself stuck. I also don’t recommend that you work here if you have a stressful home life. You need to have a happy and fulfilling personal life to deal with the amount of stress thrown your way on a daily basis here."
good,Contract work  that required minimums that are unrealistice. had to pay for own advertising didn't make the investment back as we were told.  Had to go to other methods of non-company marketing.
good,"I spent over 20 years with this company, and while their pay and benefits are excellent, the work environment is not. Training is spotty, depending on whether the supervisor is familiar with the positions they supervise. This makes for a very stressful work environment, as employees either ""fake it"", or work their best but with no support from the supervisor. Also, there is a long-standing history of unfair promotional practices, which indicate that the company is unconcerned with getting the best workers in the jobs, and more concerned with appearances and promoting their friends."
good,worked 7 years in a department and was a known leader in the department.  When a supervisor position came open I was told not enough experience as a supervisor and they went with someone outside the state and department.
good,I was a Life Ins. specialist and worked with many agents who were licensed Auto and Home ins. agents.  Leads came to me from those agents to follow up with them regarding Life Ins. or other Insurance products offered.  The manager was indifferent to many aspects of my job and was actually fired after I left Farmers in 1999.
good,"Pro-Has been a great experience and learned alot.  "
good,"Farmers Insurance may one of the best companies in the USA to work for.  However, as most large corporations are, there are a few small departments that do not follow or reflect Farmers as a whole.  It is possible to have a fantastic career with Farmers if you are under the quality management.  Sadly this has not been my experience."
good,Behavior based rating system with inconsistent calibrations.  Lack of opportunity unless you are willing to relocate.  Too much emphasis on engaging loudest employees.
good,"Although our region was one of the two regions that contained the printing center and handled the most states, our region was combined with other in another part of the country."
good,"This is a very structured environment.  Good pay.  Flexible hours.  However, you are left to find your own answers, management is rarely available to provide assistance or support.  You are always graded/scored on the recording of the phone call, even when you aren't able to provide the right answer, because you can't reach a manager for support.  Co-workers treat you rather abruptly and aloof, but they care about helping strangers in the community."
good,Opening an agency is tough. More upfront notice on cost of expenses.  Money can be made and opportunity is there but make sure to have saved up and buy an agency if possible to have immediate income.
good,"Worked to refresh my office skill, low phone managing and mail. Copies and packaging. Learned the car insurance industry. Great family work place management."
good,I was hired on for a marketer. The Job security was based on how well the insurance market is doing. The hardest part of the job was doing cold calls.  The work environment was nice.
good,I answered multiple calls and entering the claimants information into the database to be processed. I learned how to process claims and better phone etiquette .  The hardest part of the job is listening to the claimants sad experience that led to having to call me to file a loss with their insurance company.
good,Good place to work I recommend to others some times you do not get good price but for sure you get good coverage when it comes to protect yourself and family it s ok to pay little more
good,The training I experienced was not very helpful. The trainer was not prepared and would come without manuals and guides. There was one incident where the class was required to take a state licensing test and we were not given an entire section that was required. The entire class had to do an express learning session 1 hour before test time with 3 of 25 candidates failing that section. It was very competitive with most team mates unwilling to offer assistance.
good,"Farmers paid well, with good benefits, but the management cares more about the rules than they do employees. Just before my one-year anniversary, I was in a car accident. Because of that, I missed several days of work, and was fired. My performance was the best among my colleagues, but my aptitude and circumstances didn't matter."
good,"Good for College Grads that don't know any better. Get in, get your training and leave after a year. You will not grow with this company unless you kiss major butt."
good,"I retired after a 30 year career, could not wait to get out.... retired at 55 and got a pension and took a year off and found a much better company in the same field which I was much happier with..."
good,"You should already have office experience because the work here is pretty independent. Goals for commission can be quite stressful, but also quite lucrative."
good,Stressful environment with lack of training from District Office. Know what your investing before you do so. If you don't this could result in being in debt up to your ears.
good,There are many opportunities at Farmers in the right type of positions.  The culture is driving inclusiveness and diversity.  Positive strategy to move into the next generation
good,"Overall Farmers is a great company and I enjoyed working there.  When they split Bristol West into a separate company, it was non standard and the work environment/expectation changed."
good,"I worked the front office so managing the office was nice, meeting new people everyday was a great experience. i had a great boss so he made my work easier for me."
good,"Farmers is a good employer for someone who is striving for a comfortable career. The opportunities for advancement are strictly limited, specifically in certain business units. The staff is tenured and hard to get career progression and the company is constantly making changes in their people strategy."
good,I had several amazing managers and supervisors. At the end of my career at Farmers I had a manager that treated me awful. I received my 1 and only write-up from her. My other superiors loved me as an employee
good,"most of the day is spent on the phone, interviewing, talking to shops and other insurance companies.  multi-tasking is a must and must be willing to deliver decisions you may not agree with. continuous learning environment with little collaboration"
good,"Not too long of a stay with Farmers, but their overall company seems good. Their rates aren't the greatest so it made it hard to do business as well as I'm used too."
good,"I would have loved working in the office I was in, if it wasn't for the agent I was working for. He created an extremely hostile environment, accused employees of many things, even without proof, and went as far as making  comments that made his employees extremely uncomfortable."
good,Their values were not satisfactory for me.  There was no mutual trust.  The job was very informative and interesting.  The culture of the OKC office was more buddy-buddy than customer centered.
good,"There is no back up from Farmers for the Agents or Farmers employees.  They do not have a clue of demographics and ask that Agents in towns with populations 10,000 or less to have the same amount of policies of Agents in cities with over 200,000 people.  Agents and staff do not get or are offered the right type of training, and the under writer guidelines are always changing making it very hard to keep policies or book new clients.  If it wasn't for the agency owners I would not stay working with Farmers insurance."
good,"To many claims for one person to handle alone, allowed to drown in work and then blamed for issues.  Claims are not distributed evenly or fairly.  Stress level is really high."
good,"Farmers encourages a happy workplace, and engaged, educated employees. The workload can be overwhelming at times - it's just up to you to decide if you can handle it. Depending on the position it can be high stress, as you're dealing with people who have suffered a loss and can be frustrated, upset and emotional. "
good,"Good job, but limited promotional opportunities with out moving to a different market. "
good,"Waffle house was a job that you never had down time, because it was always busy. I loved this job because I met many different people and different personalities daily."
good,"The job required a lot of self motivation since it was mostly myself doing the customer care, sales, and marketing. There is not a whole lot of interaction with others, but events such as golfing made for some fun times with account holders or business reps."
good,"very family oriented"
good,"Typical day started with customer calls identifying damages to vehicle, locating vehicle, andverifying coverage(s)."
good,"It is strictly commission based. They will draw you in and get you excited about working. But at the end of the day you are working for yourself and by yourself. Monthly sale expectation are high, the cost to run your own agency will be high. They have no problem with terminating your contract, if you don't meet your sale number by your 4th month. (40 standard policy and 4 life policy) each month.  Stay clear if you don't know how insurance jobs work."
good,"did not enjoy working for the agency, as there was a VERY high turn over with this agency."
good,"I learned how to deal with different types of clients, problem solving skills and how to type out letters and make templates for both office and client use. "
good,Farmers is tough place for advancement. I was a meets employee for all my years and received one promotion. Farmers changed their way of evaluations every so often and it became too subjective.
good,"little support from corporate, good direct supervisors but, above that level very little help.  Long uninformative meetings, and no imput recognized from those in the trenches."
good,"It was a good Part time job."
good,"Busy work environment, job security, difficult to promote within the company without a degree, general call center environment, pay is okay"
good,"Obviously, if I had known the company was going to outsource my job I would not have taken the job. "
good,"communication has room for improvement"
good,"Call, on-line chat, e-mailing and assignments was not distributed enough to keep the work flow at a level that was manageable. Mandatory OT is the only way the department could keep afloat."
good,"I assisted agents with marketing pieces, did mail merges and mailings to customers, made customer data bases and answered phones"
good,I had a great progressive manager that believed in presenting project objectives and trusting in her staff to get the work done.
good,It was difficult to have your work not follow you home.  The culture and benefits steadily declined.  Coworkers were great because they understood and were going through the same things you were.
good,When in the field you have to be self motivated to complete the work in a timely and productive manner. Support from management depends on who your direct supervisor may be. There is a lot of busy work required throughout the day as well as required from management. Peers are extremely helpful when in the field. You cannot make plans when at home as you are on call essentially 100% of the year. You can be given same day notice to leave and drive across the country. Compensation is fair for current market but could be considered behind the competition when looked at the amount of work that is required. Not a lot of opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,"I was able to meet and work with many types of people as well as gain a better understanding of the insurance industry. I was responsible for giving future clients accurate quotes for home, auto, and life insurance and when applicable commercial insurance. I also submitted claims involving damage from car accidents, floods, fires and earthquakes. "
good,Frequent changes to procedures.  Very regimented schedule.
good,"nice office but no benefits, no insurance. very little pay. hours and location were good. liked the manager."
good,There were many of opportunities for growth but management was poor.
good,They have a lot of grind to make up. We are not competitive on price.
good,"Learned about insurance"
good,"I worked in Farmers Insurance Agency as office assistant. I covered auto, home, life and health insurance customer services. The Company culture was very competitive, which lead to high standard customer service performance as the basic requirement. I took the daily duties as challenges and completed my assignments before I left the office. The co-workers were supportive. The hardest part of the job was providing excelent customer services without lossing control of maners. The most enjoyable part of the job was counselting customers with professional insurance knowledges."
good,"	Analyzed and interpreted data to select prospective leads, and constructed direct marketing materials for potential clients, while collaborating with over 20 agents"
good,"basic and typical day at work"
good,Answering phone calls for call center and entering every call into the data base.
good,"Need work hard, all commision and no base salary."
good,full time job a place to work monday thru friday no weekends. The job consist of being on the phone
good,"As a Farmers Insurance Agent, you own your own business.  While the insurance agency was not for me, there were a lot of great people there.  If you are willing to put in the time and enjoy that industry, it is a great company to work for."
good,"Servicing clients policies, cold calling, prospecting and understanding the needs of the client. "
good,"There was no typical day at Farmers in my various roles, which made the work stimulating and enjoyable.  I always sought out different positions within the company to increase my development. The company did attract good talent in the ""rank and file,"" however, recent changes in leadership and management, changes in organizational goals, and wide-spread layoffs created a downswing in morale and increased anxiety.  The most challenging part of the job was implementing changes as much of the company operates in silos.  I was successful in working with cross-functional areas to overcome these challenges, but it took energy and resources that could otherwise be dedicated to higher value activities.  The most enjoyable aspects of the job for me was the latitude I was afforded to put my marketing, communication, and creativity skills into action.  I also enjoyed my co-workers very much."
good,"Reviewed multiple queues for claims and assigned to correct claims representative or department.  Assisted claims rep and supervisors with claim handling implementation and claim closure.  Provided first contact calls and distribution of letters to insured. Handled other insurance lines and quickly grasped multiple systems to submit correspondence, document claim file and submit check payments.   Compiled statistical data on employee claim handling time and their returned customer surveys.  Ensure confidentiality of management and employees.  Maintained vehicle and equipment records for 49 claims representatives, supervisors and managers throughout the United States.  Also, assisted employee’s equipment and vehicle needs.  Prepared and submitted insured check payments for property and contents.  Arranged meetings and presentations for managerial staff.  Completed special department projects.  Researched and resolved department issues with streamlining workflow.   Processed invoices and generated checks timely, communicated with vendor, researched invoice discrepancies, monitored payment status checks.   Served as community leader in various local volunteer work and established events for office personnel.  Created and dispersed weekly newsletter regarding human interest.  Resolved customer calls regarding claim status or redirected to adjuster or supervisor documented claim file."
good,Farmers is a great stepping stone to gain education and experience. I have learned and gained much knowledge in the Insurance claims industry. Management has its pros and cons. Hardest part of the job and working with co workers in the office is morale issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting others when in need and being in a challenging always changing industry.
good,"Communicate with internal/external customers about basic underwriting guidelines, policies and marketing initiatives to service customer accounts.  "
good,"- Typically on the phone making cold calls for more business."
good,Came in as agent was getting ready to retire. Assisted him in phasing out his business and transferring to other agents.
good,I started working for Famers right out of college. I was promised tons of advancement opportunites and told that most people move up very quickly. I had only worked for Farmers for a few weeks when I found out this is not true. The company is so large that people do not promote quickly as there is a lot of competition.
good,"Farmers is a great company, with excellent support staff. But... You will find consistently that the premiums they charge are several hundred to even a thousand dollars more per year than almost ALL the major competitors. And the subsidy they allow you is just that- a loan you will end up paying back in full when you don't meet the sales quota. Ad Aid is a joke- they absolutely will not reimburse you for leads purchased or ads made with ad-builder."
good,The company mission statement and goals were good. I enjoyed learning the job and my coworkers and supervisors were friendly. The warehouse facility was fairly comfortable.
good,"Worked as service advisory for 21st Century (under Farmers) handling customer service for auto insurance policies . Call center environment so will be sitting whole shift. Some managers are good and care about their employees, while others have no idea how to manage but were hired from the outside without much thought it seemed. Best part is the coworkers and the customers are usually pretty cool. Hour lunches and two 15 min breaks helps ease the stress. Hard to change shifts because they have to think about call management. NO OPPORTUNITY for advancement unless you leave customer service. You can get promoted to upper levels of service but have to jump thru many hoops and be there forever. And its also whose butt you kiss to keep your name out there."
good,Repetitive work environment. Objectives change frequently.
good,"A typical day at work involves speaking with insureds, attorneys, medical providers, and other parties to extend applicable coverages. Processing medical bills and determining correct amounts to pay takes up much of the work day, as well as sending state-mandated correspondence."
good,Often wanted employees to work after hours as well as the weekend to keep up the volume of claims received.
good,"I worked here for one year. And then moved on. Lots of politics, long hours, and tons of work. It was overwhelming at times. But I learned a lot."
good,Farmers works you hard and adds additional work to your plate constantly without even thinking about increasing your pay.
good,My position as a CSR required consideration to lots of details and focus. I was mostly on phone either changing customers account and policy or taking lots of complains about their rates going up which I had nothing to do with. In other hand it felt good to save people some money on their monthly bill and providing them with top customer service.
good,"Farmers will not pay for your training. When you sign on as a Career agent you have no choice but to accept the subsidy. If you miss your quota in one area they will automatically start taking back a percentage of your subdsidy the next quarter. Also, most of the subsidy funds end up going back to Farmers to pay for marketing programs, so it is as if they give you the money, you give it back to them, then you have to repay it back. Shady business tactic unless you make your quotas every quarter. You better be good at life sales. Also, you start with no book of business. It is an all you sales approach."
good,"Enjoyed the work and pay was adequate. I learned various ways to interact with internal and extenal customers, and de-escalation techniques. I enjoyed my time with Farmers, however the leadship was not consistant and very poor. One supervisor would approve something, while another would dispute. I feel that I should only have to approach one individual in management to inquire or address a certain situation. The focus has become the bottom line. I have seen this be the failure of many other companies. I do not see Farmers reaching their goals unless they change their views on how to meet goals."
good,"Farmers Insurance pays salaries twice a month, the 15th & last day of the month. Since Farmers pay an annual salary instead of a hourly salary and they use a paperless environment, it is expected for employees to work after your scheduled hours at outside of the office."
good,"Was not a hectic office, would receive about 10-15 calls a day some days were less. Very quite place to work sometimes it will be extremely slow. Agent was mostly gone so it did get overwhelming when people constantly called for him and could never get ahold of him."
good,"Overall happy environment to work in. It had a lot of slow moments but, I always kept myself busy. Manger was amazing and very understanding of my schedule."
good,"As an Agency Producer, you make this job what you want!! You make your paycheck what you want out of it!! I love this job and it makes me smile. My Agent is amazing."
good,"ran quotes, answered phone, issued new policies, processed payments, made bank deposits, opened and closed the office, submitted sr 22's to the state."
good,Good company to work overall for but hard to continue work when an agency owner unexpectedly sells and other company agents in the area have a full staff
good,Insurance jobs aren't for everyone. I personally did not feel accomplished at the end of my work day and the day to day was very unorganized. Some enjoy it but time just felt never ending.
good,"Very low morale. A lot of turnover, place looks like a ghost town. Leadership is no where to be found. Pay is okay, opportunities are given to favorites and its hard to get promoted or noticed."
good,"They will bombard you with claims and when you are done with your own you will be given someone else's.  Local management is fine, but corporate levels make decisions with little to no working knowledge of how their decisions effect the daily workings.  I have never spoken with someone who worked in their help point who did not absolutely hate their life while working there, but they will pay you really well for a time.  Unfortunately there are note enough advancement opportunities to go around and once you hit a certain point you will max out your pay."
good,"I was a contract worker, the company has awesome computer help, because there is no other training available.  You get responses immediately in real time."
good,"The biggest issue with Farmers is the industry itself. Insurance is stressful work for most people, and Farmers does not use any creative solutions to combat that stress. I remember one example of ""collaborative planning"". They asked some peer groups how to improve employee moral without increasing costs or decreasing work load.  ...they started sending out digital ""thanks"" badges. Thanks Farmers."
good,"If you like to look at premium and sales this is the place for you to be. There are weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually required goals to meet. You are always quoting binding and selling options and education. Great place to stay challenged and competitive."
good,"It was an internship, wasn't the best but it gave me experience and I was able to learn things. Dealing with clients wasn't easy but it gives you thick skin"
good,The department went through leadership changes that have negatively impacted the climate.  Employee and leadership morale was impacted by the lies and decent of the politics.
good,"Unless you are the top 1% of achievers in each department, there is no possibility of advancement or relocation to another department that may better suit your skills. Management only cares about the numbers and not about customer relations and detailed or thorough investigations."
good,Loved working for Farmers insurance company. Had lots of fun while working there. Nice people and great customers. Very flexible with your schedule. You kind of make your own.
good,"Working with an independent agency for the past 25 years, we've had our ups and downs, we have spent as much time adjusting and reacting to new corporation decisions that affect our livelihood as much as trying to maintain our client base and run a successful agency. "
good,A typical day at work was cold calling potential clients in an attempt to gain their business. I would get their information and pass it on to the agents so they could follow the hot leads.
good,"Farmers offers good compensation and benefits for the entry level worker. It is a tough job and in the auto department they are very understanding of this and try to do what they can to create a positive work environment. However, the property line of business is not as supportive of their employees."
good,"Farmers is a good company with good benefits and good people. The Woodland Hills campus is a very nice campus with walkable access to The Village, Costco, and Westfield Topanga shopping mall."
good,"Farmers is a strong company and many of the older agents are extremely loyal, so I know the company has taken great care of them. "
good,They shut down the call center even though it was very high rated and had good customer satisfactions. I guess customers and employees were not the priority.
good,"For a sales agent, you need to hustle. You'll have to pay for your own licensing process to get started and the company will mostly just hand you a list of people not listed on the ""don't call"" list and mostly wish you the best of luck. Only recommend to people who thrive on sales jobs and who don't mind making commission only."
good,"If you're just getting your start in the working world, or world of business, this is an excellent choice. As for longevity, ...this may not be the ideal company. Definitely not the place if you're changing careers like I did. High turn over due to a confluence of factors. Easy to make lateral moves, but due to the size, nature of business, and hiring strategy of the company (I hated the BBI), there are too many people battling for a single job. This results in the following: your education level is minimally consequential (lest the position requires it), individual contributions, merits, achievements are all too often overlooked, lost, or poorly/not celebrated, and your accomplishments outside of Farmers are inconsequential. When you start here (likely on the phones), just understand that you've hit the reset button to your previous experience. You now have none moving forward. That's what they told this teacher (me)."
good,"Lack of training due to Owner not being around. Took care of answering the phones and giving quotes, took care of incoming customers requesting quotes and handled their insurance needs."
good,great place to work. staff friendly and helpful . job training and ability to advance. very large firm. always busy and face paced. attorneys have very large case load
good,"M-F "
good,"Good place to work, very good pay. Benefits aren't what they should be given it's an insurance company but who knows maybe that will change some day. I covered 3 territories because of my work ethic which got old fast."
good,"Stressful work environment and low pay.  It was a good training in sales and customer service plus phone skills, computer, internet skills and communication skill."
good,"Different place to work.  I didn't have insurance qualifications but my sister who was the office manager trained me.  Her expertise not mine.  The hours were ok and you received bonuses if you sold car insurance, life insurance or home."
good,"i enjoyed working for this company but i was not in claims then. i was in clerical when they had a clerical dept."
good,I enjoyed my time with Farmers Insurance but this was at a specific agency. You may have a different experience depending on which agent you work for.
good,"At Farmers, I scouted new leads for prospective clients, sold insurance, and helped to coordinate marketing/advertisement opportunities. The workplace environment could be stressful."
good,The office has a great atmosphere with more focus on clients. An organized company. Management is great and understanding. Flexible to work in or outside of office; huge plus.
good,"While farmers does promote from within from what I have seen, to get into the company regardless of experience or education you have to start at entry level positions."
good,Flexible hours.  Nice building with small office with nice meeting room.  Lots of meetings daily.  You meet new people every day.  You talk on the phone most of the time.
good,"-answering phones/emails"
good,You must have lots of cash to start this business. You will not make a living for your first 2 years until the business grows. Keep expenses down until profits are up.
good,"It has been to long since I worked here.  I'm sure things have changed in the past 15 years, surly for the better.  Things were pretty crazy when I worked here long ago.  They did have an awesome training department"
good,"Interview panelists in the pre-hiring process to recruit possible candidates."
good,Very high paced call center. The job is not for someone who cannot effectivly handel unplesant customers. You need to have a attitude about upselling products to customers.
good,"It was fun working as a Marketer with Farmers, lovely people and nice customers.  But sometimes can get stressful. While it is an relaxed atmosphere to work in at times."
good,Answered calls and made out bound calls to try to bring in new clients. The owner of the agency was a good laid back guy that was there to help you succeed.
good,I thought sales would be a good thing to get into but it was a lot harder then I thought. The industry is very competitive and is hard to start just getting out of college.
good,"Good job.  Slow work.  Needed more pay and hours.  Had a great boss.  Insurance field is not for everyone.  Has it's very slow times and if you are not good at cold calling and sales, it is not for you"
good,Claims rep handles both property and casualty. Case load increased each and every year. Typically handling 30-40 claims each month. for the most part you worked out of your home. claims were faxed to you to set up initial contact with insured or claimant.
good,"Start a Free Quote and Learn More About Farmers ® Policies & What You Can Protect. 24/7 Claims. Flexible Coverage Options. Smart Savings & Discounts. Local Agents. Types: Auto, Home, Renters, Business."
good,"I did start with a salary and became a independent agent."
good,"Cutthroat, competitive, Industry of mostly men caucasion few women of African American and caucasion. Lack of traiing . Manager was new and his background was claims. Nondiversity, training."
good,"It has been several years since I worked for Farmers Insurance Regional Office. Spent 16 years after that working at the District level - which are privately owned, not as a Farmers Insurance employee. I had great relationships with all who I worked with. Many relationships have lasted for over 20 years.  Farmers was - directly or indirectly - responsible for building my work experience to what it is today."
good,Worked as agent selling Farmers products.  Built my agency from ground up and had free time anytime I wanted.  Learned all the ins and outs of the insurance industry.
good,This career choice was meant to give me a flexible work schedule and to gain experience working with people. I would not  make it a full time position.
good,"I enjoyed working at Farmers, however the claims department (especially the liability auto department) is held to an extremely high standard. Farmers adheres to the “claim owner” model, in which one adjuster is expected to handle the coverage, liability, property damage, and injury portions of the claim. This model essentially makes you the main point of contact for a claim. You are expected to meet strict timelines while also meeting your numbers. This was all on top of going out into the field to meet with customers, which would take time away from other things. You are expected to make quick decisions, have accurate and exquisite file quality, maintain a consistent standard of work, and go the extra mile for the customers. All of this is on top of the steady stream of new claims you receive on a daily basis. I did not have any prior claims experience and it took me a very long time to comprehend everything that they wanted from you. I did not receive a proper training from my peer mentor which started me off in the wrong foot. I was unable to successfully pull myself out of the whole I had got myself into. If you can catch onto the job quickly and can maintain high efficiency of work while balancing field work, new claims, injury evaluations, follow up investigations, coverage investigations, and settlements, then you may be able to succeed in this position."
good,"While I Farmers, I had a company car which was a definite perk. Much of my job required time in the field. This provided some flexibility and autonomy."
good,"It was very stressful as soon as you would do one project, you had to change it because i wasn't perfect even though it was the exact way that the manager wanted."
good,loved the schedule 9 to 5 work week with weekend off. it was hard to get people to come in and get insurance from farmers because the price was so high.
good,"Depends on your agent, usually the days go by quick if you're doing your stuff but even then its hard to move up if your agent isnt in the office and the managers are only looking out for themselves since the agent calls the shots at the end of the day"
good,My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting one on one with the agents and clients.  A typical day at work was very busy fast paced I learned so much about insurance.  Homeowners auto renters and life policies.
good,"I thought I would be good at sales, I guess I didn't have a large enough client pool, they gave me a deadline to reach a goal and I believe that I might have been used for the few clients I did drum up."
good,"The work itself is tedious, but you have a variety of other things you can catch up on. Management could train new employees better. The hardest part of the job was making sure every phone call was answered and policies were updated accurately."
good,"There was no chance for advancement, promised raises and never received, as a licensed agent my schooling was not being used.  Broken promises, long hours and stress, not for me."
good,"I enjoy my work. The only thing that made is difficult was my boss micro managed too much. I've been in the business for a very long time and I understand how to do my work and when someone adds 10 things on you and expect them to be done faster than your brain allows you and then add another 10 and asks you if you finished the 1st 10 when you barely sat down to get them started, can be way too micromanaging for me."
good,Trabaje muy bien aprendi muchisimo al respecto del papeleo necesario para terminar un proyectp
good,"I didn't like working at Farmer's.  It is a very stressful company.  I had to get a doctor's note to go to the restroom for over the 3 minute allowable restroom break time.  "
good,learned the ins and outs of health insurance. Learned how to get ew customer and make sure they were taken are of. Learned the rules and regulations to abide by
good,"It is a call center. Great company and great people to work with but the schedules/hours are not great, supervisors are not great and the phone work (Call center) is not fun. Good benefits though."
good,Very fun and relaxed. Just a lack of mentorship and structure. Friendly and clean environment. New faces and different conversations and situations makes everyday different.
good,I was hired through a temp agency to help them with their files. It was fun and I enjoy it. I would have like to stayed on with them. They really take care of their employees.
good,"They put me on cold calling. They said here's a list of over 800 numbers in your zip code and said ""start calling."" That was one of the most difficult things that I have ever done. I hated it. I am not meant for that."
good,The last 10 years have been the worst. The company has no real idea where it is heading. We get into markets and pull out. We change underwriting and rates still increase. When I started we were in 28 state and were the 3rd largest. Now we are in 45 states and 12th
good,Solid company to sell insurance for. Adequate resources. Definitely a job for the self motivated. Insurance sales is something you have to want to do.
good,"Work duties varied on a daily basis. Customer service WAS paramount EVERYDAY whether sales, service or claim related."
good,"everything was about sell sell sell and not about saving the customer any money or really helping them, Cross sell was horrible we bothered clients all the time until they went on the DNC list"
good,"Small insurance defense firm with big opportunities, this firm gave me my shot at showing my legal skills at a different level.  I was able to bring what i knew in personal injury to this firm."
good,Could have used better programs for agent hiring retention. More positivity and agent unification. More customer service training's would be helpful for client retention.
good,we did a lot of cold calling which I think is ok but they would get angry in no sales which is very hard in cold calling with no script I think we should use different methods
good,"Overall, I feel this is a great company to work for. They have pretty good benefits, although their maternity leave could be better. The office environment is a lot of fun, there is always a lot of involvement in activities. "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reviewing my claim, making first contact with any new claim, going to my appointment, completing my inspections, and then returning all my phone call."
good,Typical day at work was getting a text message with a claim and you look up the claim and call the home owner to meet. The hardest part of the job was being knowledgeable about the computer system and knowing about construction of a home.
good,It was very well to work with farmers you do receive bonuses for opening policies which is good it is fast paced and exciting you get to meet many people.
good,I was only at Farmers for my internship while finishing school. The agent was also new at the time and did the best that she could but it was not an easy start with minimal training.
good,"Agent in Charge of the Sherman Oaks Branch providing coverage for home and auto. Made cold calls, assist clients with accounts, promoted coverage for business accounts."
good,"Short Term Contract Assignment. Helped start a new district office in Burbank, CA. Looking for individuals with CA Property and Casual & Life and Health insurance license. The staff are amazing and will assist you in all of your insurance needs.  The office is brand new and located across the street from the Burbank Airport. Specifically across the parking lot of Marriott Hotel."
good,"Working as a filing clerk, I handled a set workload every day. The environment was quiet and organized which allowed for efficient independent work. There was minimal stress."
good,"Pay is good, but the job is very demanding. There is a very high turnover rate and much of that is due to people being fired. Morale is very low overall."
good,"I only worked through their training program while I was going through my licensing.  Their training involved hands on training,  role playing and videos.  Nice working culture there."
good,"Fast paced environment where either you make the cut or you do not. I did well, but it was time to move on. Typical day was making calls then going out on sales calls."
good,I am a Customer Service Rep at Farmers. I feel they have prepared me to have great communication and to be able to work effectively with individuals. I am looking for more career growth. I like challenges and to learn new and different things.
good,agecny was growing and didnt have a lot of customer service jobs since the agency was still growing. loved the location my agency was in but want enough for me to grow.
good,Too much over head as an agent and I gave up on being a agent and the whole grow your agency idea when Farmers Corp. raised rates on your book two ties a year.
good,"Not a lot of training, more like a throw you in, you either sink or swim. Set hours and days, makes it easy to plan around. A lot of phone work, and very slow paced."
good,This pretty much all I can say about this place. I didn't really enjoy working here but they paid okay for the position I had although my hours were constantly changing and so were the rules and goals at work. It was stressful towards the end because I wasn't sure if some other change at work would be announced.
good,"The company offers great opportunities if you live or can relocate to Woodland Hills, CA area, unfortunately the opportunities outside of this area are limited to a few hubs around the country.  Offer lucrative bonuses and 401k matching at 6% currently, and reasonable medical benefits."
good,"Great opportunity to learn insurance sales. It was a long commute and the office environment was fine. Good, knowledgeable people. This just did not turn out to be my cup of tea."
good,"Love working with different customers and different challenges daily. Your days will be what you make them, so make them count. More quotes is more money."
good,"I like working for Farmers Insurance Group. It is really hard to convince people to move to a new company though, when rates are double or more, than their current carrier. In most cases they aren't competitive in pricing"
good,"Slow Paced, Learned alot about phone skills and communication with clients, learned i prefer more of a challenge in the work environment and that I love working with people in person or over the phone."
good,It was fun to work there. never had a bad day at work. Customers at times were mad but they will relax after they find out why there bill is so high. But it was all good.
good,Hard to see this job end. relocation just not in my future. This is the second time I have gone through departments moving to another location out of the state of Illinois.
good,Selling insurance is depressing. It's ok for entry level experience. With good support from management when needed. Minimal leads provided so hard to make any money.
good,"Difficult environment to succeed as an agent/owner. Continual uncompetitive rates, commission decreases, and lack of company and management care or concern"
good,"Farmers is a solid company and if you have the means and patience to invest in a long term career, you should give them a serious look. "
good,"Culture is negative, unprofessional at times (in the department I worked in), and advancement is difficult. The benefits are amazing, the company does a good job of recognizing hard work.and liked the work its self.."
good,I learned a lot about insurance and human behavior. I enjoyed the job but the evaluation process is not good as you are rated on customer surveys. Typically if you find anything you can not pay in the estimate the customer will not give you a good survey.
good,"* hours of sitting at a desk typing and talking on the phone. "
good,Great place to work if you are extremely competitive. The culture there is very positive and everyone is always ready to help fellow employees out. The hardest part of the job is how competitive the insurance industry is.
good,"I like the job but no benefits , advancement within the company or  paid vacations , otherwise it would have been a great company to work for."
good,"long hours not enough for what I was expected to do"
good,"The Document Expediter job is for introverts who prefer to remain in their own heads and have little or no contact with co-workers.  No one talks to you, and you do not talk to anyone throughout the shift."
good,"Commission structure has changed and went downhill.  Very little room for advancement.  The enviroment is very stale and little things such as no free coffee.  Upper management needs work to do concerning there employees such as being more transparent as well as listening to there employees.  My immediate manager however, was awesome."
good,There is a great culture here at Farmers where you do feel like family.  There have been great opportunities for me here. I have learned a lot about the corporate side of Recruiting.
good,"This is a fun place to work with great career advancement opportunity at every corner. Also, close to many different shopping centers and restaurants."
good,Performed lots of cold calling and lead acquisition. Lots of Customer service. The work was steady with its lulls. It is a very good office job with good pay.
good,Was in charge of going through applications for potential candidates. Did a lot of cold calling and over the phone interviews. had to process appointments and set up interviews.
good,First position following college graduation but I didn't have a passion for working insurance claims and over time the position became repetitive. The amount of claims expected to be processed by each adjuster can sometimes become a heavy load.
good,I learned that not all insurance companies have very competitive rates.  It was hard convincing people to buy a high priced policy. It was difficult to get prospects as the book of business was fairly small.
good,"I learned a lot from my time with this company.  I learned mostly that I do not like this industry.  I learned too that just because you can do a job, does not mean you have to.  The company had on line courses available.  Not all the students who took courses were given the opportunity to use their new skills or knowledge.  Often managers took credit for work completed by a subordinate who received no compensation or recognition.  I pushed myself, volunteered, and made myself round self try and fit into their square holes in vain.  I felt like I had to stay there because I could move up or out of the company."
good,Okay place to work requires long hours to get started in the business.  Subsidy must be paid back if certain sales levels are not met.  Was not informed of this up front.
good,"I enjoyed learning the insurance industry but the company's main priority was the agents and not their own employees. They come across as an employee centered company but when it comes down to it, they give the impression that you are less important than the agents who call in."
good,"Our Workforce Management team consisted of Forecasting, Scheduling and Real Time.  My role was an Analyst on the Real Time team.   Our new leaders decided to move this role to Austin TX and eliminate it on Olathe KS after 11 years.  I was the last remaining employee from the original Workforce Management Team.  It is unfortunate that our leaders are going in this direction."
good,Equal pay. Fast paced and constantly changing. Handled 125+ claims for multiple states.  Determined eligibility of claims according to the letter of the law.
good,"Overall it is a fair and respectful workplace.  You are very much on your own, and you are rewarded when you do well.  The expectations and daily responsibilities are very high and broad, however, and there isn't much of a mechanism to help you learn how to manage them if you can't do it on your own."
good,"Pretty much summed up above. The job is great for someone who would like to stay at that same level forever. However, for a younger person who is motivated to move up, you will be frustrated and you will be disappointed."
good,There are advancement opportunities at this company and many different positions to transfer into. The management tries to develop you as an employee and give you options to move around.
good,"It was OK to work here, was making minimum wage, no vacation, no benefits, working for an underwriter that the more I did of his job the better he like it."
good,"..................................................................................................... I've not worked at this company long enough to give a review.................... this software is looking for information via text forcing me to continue to write, whether or not I have an opinion.  I have no opinion, good or bad as of yet due to lack of experience.... oh... did I mention that I haven't enough experience ?"
good,Worked out of office. Purchased leads and contacted clients. Most were looking for auto insurance. Not competitive. Offered multi-line discounts with homeowners insurance. Most were not interested.
good,I worked with at least 100 women in a call center environment. I processd entry level claims for Med Pip. I processed claims for three yeaars. Very interesting work.
good,"My experience was not  working in an agency, but undergoing training in a field office. I personally had a horrible experience. My training was week and I received nothing but empty promises from day one! I am sure Farmers is a great company, I think I was just unlucky with the office I was receiving my training with."
good,Farmers/Bristol West does not have competitive  pay. At times it is understaff and makes the work load a lot harder on individuals  and causes a stressful work environment.
good,Each agency has different views of selling and addressing individual insureds needs. If you are wanting to work on the agency side of the company you just need to make sure that you are compatible with the agent and agree with their views of the insurance industry.
good,Farmers has updated technology that allows their employees to get the job done efficiently.  They have good bonuses and try to reward good performance.
good,"From my perspective this is totally a sales organization.  That can be good and bad, depending on your skillset, personality and ambition level.  Recruit and sell and if you have thick skin and deep enough pockets to get started, then this could be the gateway to a thriving business."
good,"Unfortunately the agent I was assigned to did not have a proper training schedule so that I could do my job properly. The recruiters are very nice, but I cut my losses due to inconsistency."
good,The office environment was not very friendly.  Management had their favorites and I just didn't fit in to that type of culture.  I was glad to find other employment.
good,"I was able to gain skills in Maintenance, buffing floors, work in residential and commercial properties, lawn care. It was a great experience at Farmers Insurance"
good,"I have spent the biggest part of 20 years with Farmers Insurance.  My daily duties included but not limited to quoting home/auto insurance,  processing applications, cancellations, changes,  processing billings, payments, cold calling,  marketing.  My employment with Farmers Insurance has been a pleasant. I have enjoyed the work and the customer relationships I have made.  I have gained great satisfaction in knowing the customers and bosses were pleased with my work."
good,"I appreciated my time at Farmers Insurance. I was a consistent high contributor to the company's, the department, and my team's goals and look forward to bringing that same, and even an improved version of my work ethic to my new employer."
good,This is a very well established organization that has been around for nearly a century. As with most older companies they go through a transition and Farmers is no different. While they do a great job with work/life balance there are few roles available outside of leadership.
good,Rates are higher than most and not very competitive.  Management on the district level could offer more help to agents in order to attain goals set by company and district.
good,Good company that needs to find direction in what it wants to accomplish.  Needs to focus on being good at one thing and not overwhelming customers and employees on being too many things at once.
good,It was fine. I worked with wonderful people. My job was enjoyable and they treated me well. My dad also works at the facility so we could carpool.  It was a very good experience.
good,Answering phones and supporting the needs of the clients. Giving quotes when needed. Reviewing premiums for clients. I have learned the insurance business as well as the commercial too.
good,"Most of my time working at Farmers, I was offered paid studying time in order to get my license. We do group studying from time to time, but mostly alone in our office."
good,"A good job if your'e fine with being micro-managed and if you enjoy being on the phone all day. Ability to move up only if you have a Bachelors otherwise, you're stuck in the call center. Overall, decent company with decent benefits and decent pay. Great if you are fine with being told what to do and you don't think outside of the box."
good,Good place to learn about the insurance industry. A lot of cold calls and efforts for client retention. Not much room for growth.
good,"I started during a massive hiring surge. Farmers Insurance had just built a new call center in Hillsboro, OR and they planned to fill it would phone reps."
good,Farmers Insurance Group is a financial institute with very formal work culture through which we got to learn professional skills. They majorly  work with third party vendors to build the project.
good,Management wasn't very fair towards the workers. Point system was ridiculous. We worked 7 days a week and 12 hr days.  The company was growing really fast and not enough help.
good,I worked here years ago when I was still in high school.  I'm in my 30s now so I honestly can't remember a lot.  What I do remember is that everything was fairly simple to learn.
good,great place to work. Hours were nice and so were my days off. the pay was decent. it was a very non stressed work place. i would return to this work place if given a chance
good,Being a captive agent is not a good fit for me personally.  You will always be beholden to the company.  The other agents were great!  Management does what they can but it is a numbers game!
good,"I enjoy working for the agent. Flexible hours, close to home as well as my children's school. Great company to work for. I'm in need of more hrs and better pay."
good,"The pay and benefits are decent, but they're focus is on the length of the call, not whether or not you've solved a problem.  Your calls are monitored and you're expected to be able to get the customer off of the phone very quickly.  They don't care if you've solved their issue.  If you can't solve it in 3 min, transfer the call.  This just upsets the customers.  It's a frustrating environment that rewards employees for the wrong things.  All of your breaks/lunch is accounted for down to the second.  And sitting for long periods of time can be difficult to get use to.  Oh, and they go through your desk on a regular basis.  All of your stuff.  But, they don't drug test, so there's always that..."
good,You have the opportunity to be self employed using the company products with a relatively small investment. It's very difficult to start especially considering the pricing of the policies is not competitive and hasn't been for a while.
good,Your typical call center position.  You can only advance if have a degree not great for those that are currently working on degree.
good,"A typical day at work included a daily routine that ensured messages, packages, and outgoing mail where ready for pick up. The following item would be to adjust calendar according to priorities. After checking in with office staff I began marketing, sales, calls to build business."
good,A LOT of overtime. Hard to balance work and personal life. Upper Management is very unappreciative of your hard work and long hours.  Management have made it known that she wants her employees to be intimidated by her
good,"the company is getting diverse but still white employment first. Once hired you are given a fair chance to stay employed. fort Lauderdale female managers are clique and white females oriented. the head knows nothing how to investigate, evaluate and settle a claim"
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Farmers Insurance is focused and dedicated to the insurance profession. They are motivated to provide superior customer service and drive sales through cold calling, referrals and strategic outside marketing activities. "
good,It was a good experience and I enjoyed it. It was very boring at times and there were always unhappy clients. It was difficult to make an unhappy client happy.
good,"I learned so much about insurance, and everyone is very willing to help you grow and get better. The hardest part is feeling like you're good enough"
good,"Good company, typical day is processing commercial endorsement request"
good,A great place to work if you would like to become educated on insurance products. A typical day of work is busy with a chance of busy. Service work is constant and writing new business will keep you tied up for hours.
good,A typical day at work was finding new clients to sell insurance to. I learned how to sell and market with this company. I liked to co-workers I worked with very nice people. The hardest part of my job was having a deadline to meet production. Overall I liked this job.
good,"Handle customers wrecked cars, calculate and offer settlement amount, solve the claim, send paperwork out and follow up on the status of the claim. If payment applicable, pay the claim."
good,The rates are the major problem. It is a rare moment that Farmers quotes are even close to the competition. If it were somewhat close it would be okay but it is not very close at all.
good,I worked there for 3 years with constant restructuring.  This is still going on today.  The people were good to work with but the constant feel of instabilty was disheartning.
good,"It's not for everyone.  It's great for people who are good though. It takes a lot of focus and determination and most importantly, it takes a lot of money to run and maintain an agency."
good,"I learned how to treat different kinds of customers during this job. Some of customers will come to our office with a very bad mood, because of they just got into an accident. We have to know how to calm the customers, and give them a professional attitude in order to solve the problem perfectly. "
good,"Cold calling binding apps, love my co worker and love my customers wish I could stay on, just not enoughhours love the people and the place"
good,"Good Work culture and updated technologies to work on."
good,"My boss was nice, but never around. I was left to fend for myself, and while I succeed it is not what I want to do forever. I did learn a lot about insurance."
good,"Farmers used to take care of it's own.  If you worked hard, improved yourself, you could advance.  Now they are just filling seats, if you make too much you are pushed out and they are not friendly to the Hispanic customer."
good,"I provided customer care for policy holders and independent insurance agents. Assist Insurance Agents with troubleshooting & navigating billing and payment systems while providing clients with conflict resolution. Requires analytic skills. Management made it clear that it didn't trust it's employees to work. So they recorded and watched everything and pressured the employee's with unrealistic expectations. "
good,Independent job orientation with progressively increasing budgetary authorizations to settle claims. Balance between field work at claims sites to write estimates and staying in the office to complete administrative work.
good,"After working in professional tennis and being an ex-professional player, working in corporate life took a little getting used to.  When I was the Director at clubs or playing for a living, everything I did was solely based on what I did, nothing else.  In the corporate world, I have found that is only partially true."
good,"Captive agency model"
good,"I worked as a self employed insurance agent for Farmers. insurance. I was responsible for all aspects, Selling, servicing and account servicing"
good,No consistency.  Had 7 different supervisors in 30 months.  High turnover.  Very little opportunity for advancement on operations side.
good,"hardwork abounds, friendly co workers, management more robotic than helpful.  Central located work location close to shops and restaurants."
good,I would start my day off by pulling my teams inventory and advise what claims needed to be touched that day. I would make outbound calls to customers to discuss their estimate and payment options. If they missed their appointment I would attempt to reschedule. I would address any issues or concerns about the estimate they might have. I managed rental if it applied.
good,Fun place to work with supportive environment. Easy to make personal relationships with customers. Satisfying job! This job allows personal growth as long as you stay on top of your prospect list...
good,"fun environment, great management.  Good work like balance.  There is always something to learn.  Has a great team environment coworkers are always willing to help."
good,"Predictable working hours. This company's agents are independent entities, so pay and benefits vary from agent to agent. Retention of clients was the hardest part with so much competition for the lowest insurance rates be it home, life, auto, business, etc. Extreme organizational  and great customer service skills are definitely a must Meeting different people from all walks of like was truly the best part."
good,"Entry level build the business, investment required book of business builds the next book of business feeder system maintain accurate records contract required"
good,"I really enjoy my team. I have developed great, trusting relationships with each of them. We mutually respect each other and work to help and strengthen each other. Together we have become the leading team in the office in Customer Service Survey Results (100 surveys YTD, overall score 93%), Direct Deposits (for claims payments) and File Quality/Inaccuracy Dollars (Overpayments/Underpayments)."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is educating my clients on what type of coverages they have to protect their families. I have learned that I will never stop educating myself on how to better protect my cleints.
good,Management is difficult.  You will carry a large claim load and there is nothing fun about yelling on the phone all day long.   However if you are ok with the issues the job is a fun place with lots of comraderie.
good,"Great experience, learning the insurance business how to sell products that will help potential customers, its a very stressful industry but could be rewarding."
good,"My day consisted of doing requotes for perspective clients on home and auto policies, and making cold calls to new potential clients for home and auto quotes."
good,"the people I worked with were the best part of the job, mostly. The company loaded on the work and supplied very little opportunity to finish it within the time frames they wanted.  They did supply the training, some might say overboard and allowed opportunities for extra training if you could find the time to complete it. Management tried to care but I think the pressure from corporate hindered that a lot and they micromanaged everything you do and did. Overall I learned a lot and appreciated the training they provided, but hated the environment."
good,"Office drama needs to stop.  Management is good.  Benefits could be better, but good opportunity for advancement in corporation."
good,"I had a good time working with Farmers insurance, i had help from my co workers and management with anything i had a question about. it's a tough industry, unfortunately it was not for me."
good,I learned the entire insurance industry. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. Management was helpful but sometimes lacked the skills or information needed to train or assist employees.
good,"Lots of calls, people are very nice and willing to help. Lots of information, many systems to navigate around. Its a good company and there are great people, but sometimes the long hours can suck the life out of you and if you get in ka-hoots with the wrong people, your work and social life could be filled with nothing but drama."
good,"There is potential to make a lot of money, but you have to be willing to invest a lot of time and money to make it. The company is also very restrictive in new business it is willing to take, which makes things more difficult for you. You are investing the time and money to find customers but it is very possible you won't have a product that works for the customers you are able to quote."
good,"Property and Casualty Insurance is linked to your credit score."
good,"Review and estimate claims on a daily basis, handle rental, service the customer and issue payment. Holidays off and weekends off"
good,"This job demands the need for me to be a self-starter, to set and meet daily, weekly, and monthly goals. It has allowed me to develop solid and lasting relationships with nearly every customer, and even non-customers."
good,"If you are up for a dedicated, un-tethered, start... Farmers Insurance would be a decent way to go. Also, must mention, a sales and marketing aptitude and management potential/experience are a must. "
good,"Demanding job. Hard to balance work and personal life. Ability to set your own schedule is a plus, but most weekends are spent in the office."
good,"Typical call center environment, except the agents and customer service reps for the agents could talk or yell at you anyway they wanted and the company did nothing about it. There were a few out there that were very pleasant to work with and made your day. I learned how to underwrite a risk based on information and photos, however when the agents didn't like your answer, they were rude and hateful."
good,I have enjoyed my work and learned a lot about technical and business work.
good,"Negative environment - constantly speaking with unhappy customers results in coworkers complaining all the time."
good,Culture is good and the company trains really well.  Good palce to work bu the pay isnt that good.
good,"Dealing with customers, helping your co-workers. I learned how to have better patience and better customer service."
good,"Handling multiple phone lines and transferring callers to the appropriate individual.  Clerical support. "
good,"Farmers corporate is a good place to grow in terms of knowledge and skills, however, project and program managers seldom have authority to make decisions in this weak matrix environment."
good,"Farmers is one on the largest insurance companies.  They have a strong competitive advantage because of the strength of their company.  Farmers has a solid business plan and has instituted a strong training and employee relationship program which allows their employees to feel secure and at ease."
good,"Full scale breadth and depth of the entire insurance realm – Worked in all facets from effectively marketing, quoting, and selling of Life, Health, Property, and Casualty Insurances policies to maintenance of customer accounts and customer support. Excellent worker when comes to customer relations and very personable."
good,"filling paperwork, answering phones. customer service was a big part of the job, making sure you helped each customer the best I could. most enjoyable part of my job was putting a smile on there faces and doing my best to help with all there needs."
good,"The agent I worked for was not financially stable, Farmers is a good company though."
good,Good office to work at but limited opportunities. Was excellent experience and fun to work despite poor office management and recognition of accomplishments
good,"Always letting people go for the smallest things, system always messing up"
good,I haven't worked there for many years.  The coworkers were great and so were many of the team leaders.  However; procedures and equipment desperately needed modernization. Hopefully these things have been handled by now.
good,"This had great potential, but I did not like the used car sales approach they required.  They also provided no training.  It's a cattle call job.  Hire ten and see who sticks."
good,The pay was not great for the amount of effort that i put in. translating for Spanish speaking people was good practice.
good,"My experience was not a positive! lacked company support!"
good,"This was my first job in the insurance industry and I wasn't sure what to expect. Along with property and casualty, I enjoyed commercial insurance the most. Unfortunately Farmers was unable to come up with comparable quotes. The hardest part of the job was cold calling. I enjoyed speaking with the customers"
good,"I enjoyed working with clients over the phone and learning a new software program specific to the insurance industry.  The management (owner) was knowledgeable in his business, but rather shy when it came to customer service.  Because this position worked around my school schedule, it was ideal for me, but he then changed my hours and job duty to strictly telemarketing.  Because I personally do not respond to telemarketers, I didn't feel comfortable cold calling to sell insurance.  I had no co-workers save for the other agents, but enjoyed the company of the other agents tremendously."
good,"No stability - hours constantly changing."
good,shifted from position to position.  pay was not good.  ethics and management were poor.
good,A rewarding position that provided a great opportunity to discuss P & C coverage as well as financial services with potential clients.
good,"It is s wonderful experience working in here, it was a day to day challenges facing work done here"
good,Help customer from start to finish with auto repairs after accident
good,"I enjoyed working in an office environment. I stayed motivated on the field by speaking with customers,"
good,"I would go to work, clock into my phone and put my headset on right away. As soon as my computer was on I would open all my programs and turn my phone on. From that moment I would receive call after call with no down time of customers needing to make claims on their home or car insurance. I would need to hit certain points in my call that I was graded on later. The grading and standing you have within the department helped with raises, bonuses, and moving up in the company eventually. We would also take calls for existing claims and help get customers to their correct claims adjuster. I would have a scheduled 15 minutes break then I was right back on the phones till lunch for 45 minutes and my last 15 minutes break. Most calls were not too bad, you always had the occasional customer who was upset and did your best to call them down and get the necessary information to accomplish the claim correctly."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day at work is satisfing all my customers needs in a one call resolution. The hardest part  of my day is not having the necessary tools/resoures to assist my customers.
good,"I am on call 24/7 waiting to be sent to the next catastrophe site, where I will work 10-12 hours/day for 21 days straight (including weekends). Daily activities include: Investigate catastrophe losses, analyze property damages, prepare loss assessments, negotiate settlements, and handle multiple claims daily. The position requires up to 100% travel but usually ends up being about 75%."
good,"great company, I just could not find the work/life balance to be an agent."
good,"•	Skilled in telephone and face-to-face interaction with clients and business partners"
good,Great opportunity to be a successful business owner. New agent programs support the agents very well.
good,"Process faxes via computer in between calls, taking calls back to back depending on traffic volumes on anything from reviewing coverage and procedures to changing vehicles, etc. Every week calls and performance metrics are reviewed in self-evaluations as well as unit meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is always knowing how well you are performing, having some independence, and helping people with their coverage."
good,learned a lot that i did not know prior to working there and am taking that knowledge and applying it elsewhere.
good,"Various tasks performed each day from quoting to taking payments and processing changes."
good,"I learned how to help people with they're insurance, I also learned how to take payments"
good,"Tough rules and regulations"
good,"The training is excellent, the job is challenging. I enjoy the people I work with, and my supervisors have helped make the job easier. "
good,"I enjoyed the freedom involved in the job, but money was flowing in the wrong direction at an alarming rate.  Between the cost of leads, gas and advertising, my savings took quite the beating.  If you're well connected or have the money to buy an existing agency, by all means go ahead."
good,"Position as Call Center Manager was a challenge from the beginning, but gave me a chance to see what I was capable of.  Turns out that the position was not a really good fit for me, so I decided to move on to another opportunity that would better utilize my abilities and skill set."
good,"I ended up working here for 6 months. I was hired on as a temporary employee to help the permanent people get caught up with their work."
good,Limited opp for advancement.  Unrealistic daily goals for claims.
good,"I am at the office at 6:30AM to complete webinars and follow up on emails. Around 8:00 AM, I start answering phone calls until 3:00PM. During the last part of my day I meet with the health insurance broker to go over any tasks assigned to me such as  making outbound phone calls, putting client's spreadsheets together for each health care provider. I've learned that all our customers have different insurance's needs and importance of tailoring each product according to their needs. Management is very helpful when it comes to answering my questions regarding complex situations. About one third of my co-workers are bilingual and everybody tries to help each other. The hardest part of this job is reviewing complex billing questions. The most enjoyable part of this job is assisting clients with their health insurance's needs."
good,"Was a great place to start employment  after high school."
good,Busy fast past work place. There is is alway something new to learn and a very active enviroment.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, especially the direct people I work with."
good,"I did not have a memorable experience in the Insurance market. It just wasn't for me. I did learn about the rating system in california for auto insurance. In addition, I learned that there are many different parts to insurance. I did however, love working with the people. I spent a great deal of time working with seniors on making sure that there policies matched their needs. This was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was constantly being told to produce more business and build a rapport later. This took some adjusting."
good,Was very hard to get the agency profitable due to the North Ridge earth quake.
good,"The management is nice in the Olathe location but it's a typical call center. Work takes precedence over personal life and it's hard to advance here. If you're looking for a good benefits packing and steady work, it's a great place. If you're looking to use your creative juices, have a more relaxed schedule or looking to move in your career- it's not really the place for you."
good,A good job that shows you how to work with other peoples lives and money.
good,"The 'salary' you receive is actually a loan which you must pay back"
good,This was a call center environment. A typical day consist of heave inbound calls regarding personal insurance lines of coverage. 
good,"Customer service representative, sales, client quotes in Life, Home , Auto and Business. Prepare all necessary documents and all needed client information. "
good,"Time management, Sales, General Office, hardest part is providing your own leads. I did not have co workers, this is a self start position"
good,They give you most everything you need to develop yourself professionally in sales. Every day was focused on developing a consultative approach to any needs basis while educating the consumer and focusing on value. It was a great learning experience from cold calling to initial meetings to close. 
good,Working for Farmers gave me invaluable insight into the Insurance industry as a whole. 
good,"A typical day started out with checking messages, handling new losses, determining liability, issuing payments for property damages and bodily injury claims. I learned to multi task and perform my job better since I was a field adjuster and also worked in the office.I had an open door policy with my manager that I was able to ask questions as needed. I worked well with my co workers, asked them if I had questions or needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was time management since I traveled a lot to go to scene to take photos and take recorded statements or obtain police reports. Then I had to come back to the office to handle all of my paperwork on the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work both out in the field and in the office. "
good,I learned how to write an insurance policy.  I tw as a lot of information to learn. 
good,"Farmers does a great job training their employees, but has a difficult time providing a good career path for people. Insurance claims is a difficult job and will beat up any good person. They provide decent compensation and benefits, but they have been declining since I started. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Insurance agents.
good,"My normal work day includes checking my voice mails, reviewing my claims inventory, and working my inventory from beginning to end."
good,"Call center environment, sitting all day, answering approx 80 calls a day.  Co-workers are friendly and helpful.  Learned much knowledge of the insurance business."
good,"I was dependable, and a hard worker, and they were fair to work for."
good,"Overall, I have had a pleasant experience while working for Farmers Insurance. My responsibilities include building a strong sustainable book of business through selling Auto, Home, Life and Business Insurance. I have exceeded my sales goals every quarter. Typical sales are made in the late afternoon or early morning. My co-Workers have come and gone with the high turnover. In order to succeed, one must treat position as a building business as opposed to a working a job."
good,"*File work, phone call mangement, office coordinate and customer follow up"
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and supervisors at Farmers. It is a very strict work environment.
good,A very intense work environment. Everyday came with a new stress
good,"Assisting customers with their billing and auto insurance policies. Learned how to manage work loads for other departments such as clerical, accounting, sales and claims departments."
good,IF you want to stay busy then this is the job for you. High stress and lots of learning. Work is non-stop
good,Good place to work but no advancement opportunities. The days go fast with a steady stream of work.
good,"I would prefer not to say as I still work there, however, the people I work with are top notch."
good,"Being a claims representative was a very interesting job especially if you enjoy the challenge of the claims process: investigations, determining liability, negoiations, and settlements. Achieving goals were a result of learning and applying all facets of the claims process and time management skills."
good,The training and experience you can get with Farmers is spot on!
good,"Solid company financially. Must be self-motivated, driven and have a marketing plan to be successful."
good,"Ran my own agency, with daily workload, in helping clients with coverage questions."
good,Loved the atmosphere & my work schedule. Enjoyed having my own work space.
good,Big reward for hard work. Recent culture change created growth obstacles for medium size agencies.
good,"Working with customers discussing options for the repair of their vehicles. While there I've learned the value of working with other team members to achieve a common goal, focusing on the strengths of my co-workers and using those to reach higher levels of accomplishment. Although some customers have specific expectations and desires, I have learned to tactfully help them re-evaluate those ideas and choose from options that are available. The company as a whole has made strides in trying to make the atmosphere enjoyable yet professional."
good,"Did a lot of filing, communicating with customers, dealing with stressfull employees."
good,"Successfully recruited, hired, and trained new agents. Developed protocols for tenured agents to increase profitability and increase customer retention."
good,"A very secure place to work in a down economy, but there is a lack of motivation within company. Company is so large it seems they lose sight of what the employees needs are and how to motivate them to want to work for the company. Many opportunities to advance, though the process seems cumbersome and slow which causes employees to go elsewhere after gaining experience where they can grow at a faster pace."
good,"Friendly, work on your own schedule, meet new clients every day"
good,"Farmers Insurance is a good place to work and being an insurance adjuster is a unique job. The position requires you to be a creative problem solver that can multi task constantly. You must also have excellent communication skills because you have to work with customers, body shops, attornys, and management."
good,"I enjoyed my time spent at Farmers Insurance. The position that I held did not have enough room for advancement or job security. Majority of my time was spent cold calling, although a great learning experience I much rather interact with people in person."
good,I learned multiple tasks that will help me in the future with my career.
good,"nice place to work, good environement, professional, great company to work for"
good,"learned property and casualty insurance, quoting and accepting payments from clients.  Soliciting for  life insurance clients. answering phones and ordering office supplies."
good,Key is to manage overhead cost to be profitable.  Need to work diverse hours to reach maximum number of customers. Need at least 5 years of building customer base to make a livable income.
good,"Working at farmers was great, they really took care of the employees and were attentive to needs. There were food days and they gave treats out randomly. They had town hall meetings to make sure all employees had the chance to speak about wants/needs for the work environment."
good,The day goes by fast. You are working throughout the day from when you get there until you leave. Management tries to keep the morale high but sometimes the workload and requirements prevent that. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"Being a claims adjuster is a difficult job. Having a claim is stressful so customers are not in a great frame of mind to being with. The high claim volume and push to always doing things faster puts stress on employees as well. I do enjoy my co-workers. Great group of people,"
good,"It's a call center, but it's good from what I've been informed (It's the only one I've been at). For the job, they provide you great training and keep assisting you then those interactions slow down when you are sufficient at the job."
good,Very fast paced and stressful.  Good help with the supervisors.  Hours change every year which I don't like.  The employee parking lot is huge & wish they had a shuttle bus like the airports do!!!
good,"Too many leadership changes in IT, Remaining leaders leave a lot to be desired. The employees themselves are usually very friendly. Many employee groups and events. HR and Finance are weak functions compared to public companies."
good,"I was a contractor and worked only a short time before budget was pulled from my project."
good,"overall alright place to work, there does not seem to be a lot of support at times from the people above you, not a lot of room to grow but can learn a lot here before moving to another company"
good,"Currently, I do not wish to provide a review for the company. At some moment in time, I will provide a well thought out review that would benefit future employees."
good,"I enjoy working for Farmers, and my agent is great. Unfortunately he is unable to pay for full time and I’m looking for full time and a office that will allow me to bring in more commission."
good,"I worked with a broker Agency in Woodland Hills area,"
good,Lots to do. No time to slow down. Large need to balance multiple responsibilities. Must be able to manage a number of expectations of varying people. Flexible schedule.
good,"Company as a whole is great, but my particular office was grossly under-staffed and supervision failed to act and correct problem.   I watched a dept that was already 4-5 people short lose 7 more...while supervision only hired 2 to replace them."
good,"Training was paramount for many reasons.   It was great to have someone to answer all your questions for many weeks.   There is so much more to learn, but having a big group, we all depend on each other to find the answers."
good,Working for Farmers was a great role for me to educate myself with insurance services along with sales systems. I recently relocated to Arizona and with a lot of changes in the company I was unable to open a second agency here.
good,"Position could not be managed within an 8 hour work day when claims volume was high, which is most of the year. Expectations are high, as they should be, but staffing does not match the need to achieve good work/life balance and overtime several times a week is a must. Some management is good, some not so good, and those that aren't so good will never leave and will not be forced out. If you get a manager that is your champion, you are set. If you get a manager whom you do not work well with, you will struggle and they will work to oust you."
good,"A good place to work, co -workers are amazing and easy to get along with.  Not a good life work balance though, they used to be but are no longer.  Not easy to move up to advance."
good,"this is a 1099 job so no benefits, no consistent salary.very hard cold calling customers. lack of support. hard to get help when needed. this job is not for everyone."
good,"Haven't worked there in more almost 20 years, so not sure about their culture now."
good,Overall excellent opportunity for agency ownership. Good training  and financial support. Good help to start an agency including signage allowance and office location.
good,"If you do not want to be an agency owner or district manager, corporate opprtunities for advancement are limited, unless you are willing to relocate to Austin, KC or LA."
good,"Farmers is just like any other company."
good,"Took claims from customers with Farmers Insurance Policies. Helped them file their claims, weather it be Home, Auto etc. Nice place to work, decent pay and good benefits."
good,Had an opportunity truly learn the insurance field. Met with individuals to meet personal and family needs. Workplace was very friendly. It was awesome to meet so many new people and business owners.
good,"The Farmers insurance a strictly formal structured company that has a of policies to be adhered to. Good training and advertisement for the agents. the company generated some leads for the agents. However, the premiums were relatively higher compared to those from independent agencies"
good,Farmers Agency work was incredible for three decades but the recent dollars only management style in Switzerland seems to have trickled down to the local District Managers who don't really actually care about their agents.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phones, taking messages, collecting quote data for the insurance agent to run a quote, received payments, made deposits, applied payments in the system."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the insurance industry."
good,Staff was great to work with. Management needs some work.  Micromanagement is just not  always necessary. Plus management is not at all consistent in their expectations or how they treat employees.
good,Customer service positions provide an opportunity to do valuable work helping put customers' lives back together. Schedule and expectations are rigid  and compensation is average.
good,I started my own business from scratch - which one can no longer do. I had to learn how to attract new customers and marketing strategies. Many of the strategies i was taught are outdated.
good,Good compensation and very good retirement plan.  Pretty good work environment.  Professional but casual too. Not sure how competitive they are these days in the market.
good,"Pay and compensation/benefits is very competitive, however when it    comes to APD, upper management has little to now idea how much work the job actually involves. If ever their was a company where the bosses needed to switch jobs with the regular employees for a day, it is Farmers. All you ever hear is how stressed out every APD adjuster is and the only way management has responded to our concerns is continue to add more and more work and responsibilities to an already strenuous job."
good,I work in a call center so communication and technical skills are at a premium.  I have developed these skills through direct interaction with agents and their employees on a daily basis. The demands on these skills have been especially challenging these past few years with the rapidly changing Insurance market. Despite these challenges I especially enjoy working with our agents in solving problems.
good,"Management can be a little bit rough at times, but overall the place is generally a great location to work for. Stick to the scripts and you wont find yourself having many issues, though if you deviate from the lines, it could cause you troubles."
good,"They constantly looking to cut on expenses, they are relocating our office to Grand Rapids, as a result 105 employees will be without jobs effective January 1, 2017."
good,"Overall, the employees were fun to work with. The company really offered no room for advancement. There were a lot of long term employees but reduced employee numbers by large layoffs."
good,"The district office is where I am currently working on getting trained to be an independent producer. The office is full of friendly dedicated and hard working people. Some learning how to be a high quality agent and owner of their own business/agency. The others are the staff whose position there to assist you on your path. There is a positive atmosphere, coupled with humor as well as professionalism."
good,If you want to be in business for yourself and are willing to wait  five years before seeing a big ROI this is the ideal occupation.
good,"I liked this place it had good co-workers. I did not like one thing is there was a lot of drama. I enjoyed working alone. I've learned a lot about marketing,"
good,Working there overall was a good experience but with my hours changing as to when I needed to be there and how many I would get in a week made it more difficult.  My day mostly consisted of making cold calls for 2 different agents and trying to set appointments.  I did enjoy the people I worked with and made one good friend.
good,"Great team of IT professionals, many with 10+ years of tenure. Enjoyed the challenges of delivering international support. Like many IT organizations, budget constraints at times limited investment in needed technology and IT had to deliver with severe limitations."
good,Company is closed. I really enjoyed with working with the community of clients. The clients really enjoyed he products and the teams and store locations.
good,"A typical day at work would represent:"
good,"Farmers has been very good to me and my family.  It is a great place to work and to be challenged every day. Good benefits and great team to work with.  As with any job, the people are everything and the people here are great."
good,Great salary and job security.  Leadership has a tough time building a positive culture..making great strides though.  They've been overall pretty good to me since I started
good,"Only work at the job for a short time. It was fun for the time, but I wasn't successful at distilling policies. Hired a few employees and enjoyed the work. It ended up costing me more than I made. In a different setting with a better natural market. It is possible to quickly thrive and become a career agent."
good,"I am happy with the pay decent benefits and work flexibility. People are overall good to work with.  Been here 9 years, no promotion opportunities."
good,"Attend calls, emails or walk in customers with inquiries and requests."
good,"There is a lack of communication between departments. Resources and documents were not updated when they should have been, which caused poor customer service. Many technological issues with web applications, which hindered performance. Management was good and tried to help out as much as possible. Most co-workers were enjoyable."
good,Farmers Insurance is a high quality company to work for.  They offer handsome wages and benefits that many companies have stopped offering.
good,This is truly a build it from the ground up situation.  Management gives you a lot of information but also sells you the up-side more than anything.  Group benefits are not very cheap or good.  Love helping people protect their families.  Worse part is being broke and trying to build a business.
good,"I feel like my district manager allowed me to to get into an industry before I was ready which lead to financial situations I'm dealing with 2 years later. I feel all 'reserve' agents should be placed into an agency for 6 months to a year before starting on their own. The Farmers name and what they stand for is a good thing. I believe in the products and claims services to be among the very best, I just wasn't prepared to be an agent at the time."
good,"I am passionate about the law and enjoy being a lawyer. This company remains profitable and continues to grow which places a heavy burden on the lawyers to act in the capacity as an administrator. Consequently, this takes away from my ability to practice law. The cases are interesting and my colleagues are fantastic. I am exposed to and responsible for all aspects of litigation including trial work which is my favorite part about being a lawyer but is unfortunately where I spend the least amount of my time."
good,Working at Farmers was a great experience.  I was able to jump start my secondary education and build on my continuous education professionally.  Farmers maintained an interest in its employees work life balance and there was roof for advancement.
good,Good work environment and great team work. Good people to work with.
good,"Great for work/life balance.  "
good,"A typical day would start with following up on previous policies that were turned in. I would then begin with some cold calling, call backs and appointment setting. Afternoons were used for out in the field operations. For example, meeting clients from set appointment, meeting sales agents from auto dealerships or in general interactions with the public such as the DMV."
good,Lots of issues that are unrelated to work. I wish the best for this agency and for it's future.
good,Word of advice. Great opportunity but go with the match contract.
good,Must have the ability to sale and the enthusiasm to deal with all types of people and their needs.
good,"Fair treatment of members, fair fee schedule, respectable company"
good,"I think that this is a good company to work for, however I was displeased with their training program.  It is very hands off, minimal training. The best part of the job was the co-workers.  They were very nice, personable people who enjoyed their jobs."
good,"Being in the claims department at Farmers Insurance has its pros and cons.  They pay is pretty good, but some company's offer more.  There is a lot of flexibility and as long as you do your job you aren't micro-managed.  The benefits are pretty good and you get a company car.  You typically have to work overtime if you want to get everything done and they tend to overwork their employees at times."
good,Claims environment.  Detail oriented and computer based position. The companies goals are based upon numbers rather than customer experience.  The hardest part of the job was being able to spend enough time with customers and balancing work and personal life.
good,Good work place but too many key players. Not much advancement
good,My job functions were expecting nothing to change but to expect everything to change in a second depending on company need.
good,Great company to grow withwith great benefits. Insurance company helping people must like to talk on the phone
good,"This is a good company for; however, the coverage rates are sometimes difficult to overcome."
good,"Answer calls, create profiles, make  payments, always dealing with satisfied customers. I learned how to help people insure their belongings. Learned how to use computer programs. Learned better phone skills."
good,"A fine company to work for that provides a chance for individuals with drive to own their own business.  As I mentioned in the review summary however, personal lines insurance (auto and home) in Oklahoma is highly competative.  "
good,"Since I wasn't license to sale insurance a typical day at work would consist of me starting my day with a demographic strategy and target to go in the field (street, shopping centers and other business locations) to gain potential leads/clients to quote. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I would performed general administrative duties to support professional staff and managed daily office scheduling. My Branch Manager and co-workers were positive good workers and allowed the workplace to be a comfortable setting. The hardest part of the job was working off commission and only getting paid from guarantee leads to paid to for my own license course."
good,- Conducted weekly marketing sessions to produce new business and current business.Provided prime phone skills while telemarketing and also phone calls to current clients to provide repeat business relationships.
good,"Not the most challenging or rewarding job, but it provides a stable, comfrotable way to earn a living. I love my agent, who treats me very well. My agent, however, is at the mercy of the corporate hold of Farmers, which often chokes its agents."
good,"Management promises to advance good employees, but this is not merit based. Raises, promotions and advancements are not based on work performance or product quality."
good,"Farmers Insurance Group is a good, strong company. Insurance sales is a very competitive industry and you really have to be on top of your game at all times to succees. Farmers gives you phenomenal training and an abundance of resources."
good,Loved my co-workers. You work hard then work harder. Sometimes as a Admin Assist we are over looked.
good,"Good pay, and benefits!"
good,"ServicePoint -- call center environment, micro managed every second of the day. pretty easy job once you learn the ropes"
good,"Prior to the company merging to what it is known now as Farmers it was Bristol West .In which a medical benefits were amazing a great for all family needs,open door policy was always encouraged and more opprotunity for advancement.Working at Farmers I have learned alot and they do well training and updating their employees on all changes to provide the best service to our customers.Theres alot of uncertainty being many changes are being made that drastically impact the companys future here in Florida and possibly relocating the office."
good,"Farmers used to be a ""family"", but has really struggled over the years to keep and grow business due to non-competitive pricing structures.  As a result, employees are no longer part of a family, but rather a financial transaction on a ledger. The company continually changes strategies in order to try and compete in the marketplace, but they do nothing to distinguish themselves or justify their outrageous prices.  As a result, policyholders are walking out the door in droves.  There have been several reductions in force over the past 5-6 years, and there is really no end in sight.  Benefits are pretty good, and pay is good.  Farmers did invest well in their management development, and provided a number of opportunities for career development.  But as the company continues to lose policies, promotional opportunities are less and less.  It has become a recycling of the same managers in different roles, with stagnant development for up and coming employees.  The company touts diversity and inclusion, but the upper levels of management really only want to include those who think the same as them.  The company encourages challenging the status quo, but not if the status quo was an idea from higher levels of management.  Several national projects that were clearly not impactful were branded a rousing success, because the ideas of upper level management will never be declared as unsuccessful.  Again, it was in times past a good place to work, and may even be a decent place to currently work...but I would be very leery of the future and job security."
good,"Terrific place to work, almost like family, very supportive.  But as top management changed through mergers, it became more corporate"
good,I was there to help the insured's. It was my favorite to help and suggest coverages for their policies. I also enjoyed the everyday tasks of running and organizing an office.
good,Fast paced environment where you have to remain focused and diligent to complete the assigned workload within 40 hours. Did not leave time for personal development and networking. Flexible work hours and benefits provided.
good,"My review is based on my experience in the field and tenure with the company. I have worked in the insurance field as an adjuster and contractor for over 22 years. There are a few roadblocks in working with the company and I will note them along with the benefits.  The roadblocks are turn over, volume, training, and expectations. There is a high turn over rate in that particular department and office due to lack of help or training once the claims begin to come in.  There was always the need for people to cover other territories with high volume.  I also noted the volume of work placed on the property adjusters for this company in general is high with unrealistic expectations.  There is a high volume of claims but limited hours you are allowed to work them before overtime kicks in.  The overtime is great but due to a past lawsuit the management seems to be very edgy about this.  The volume is there but time needed to complete is not. Another example if you deny a persons claim based on the policy and expectations there is no reason the company should expect a positive review to come in from that same customer.  That same review becomes part of your performance evaluation which anything less than 100% is questioned.  A lot of what you learn is done on a ""as it happens basis"" and you are expected to learn from your peers who are already swamped in their own territories many with little experience.  I do feel as though the company is good one to work for but needs to have a better structure in place when it comes to the time expectations, reviewing of work,  and training of the"
good,I do not have much opinions regarding the company. Everything was defined in the previous questions. I enjoyed my working environment and my work. I also learned a lot.
good,"The ""Farmers Family"" feeling has deminished since being bought by Zurich Financial.  The sense of collaboration has increased but individuals may not feel that they are being supported or trained for future development."
good,"It depends on which agent you are working for.  Can have flexibility in work hours, but typically there are no paid holidays, no vacation, benefits, or compensation.  May be a good fit for a person looking for a second income already covered by a spouse."
good,"Very numbers focused "
good,"Overall Farmers is not a bad place to work, however, the call center was terrible. You were essentially chained to your desk by your phone cord and took calls for 8 hours a day. They tracked essentially everything you did. Management was hit or miss. Some truly cared and were good while others only pretended. Their rating system for pay raises and such is a joke. Benefits and pay are great. Advancement is above average."
good,If you enjoy sales there is a lot of opportunity for success.  If you are not comfortable soliciting business this job can be very discouraging and financially draining.
good,"I worked there for 1 year and their education for agents are pretty good. However, the products are really competitive and high price compare to other companies."
good,Good company for younger people or people who have money to invest. Leadership changes directions constantly which is very frustration. Good money but easy to plateau.
good,its a decent place to work but there is not a ton of advancement opportunity. Work life balance is good but work is uninspiring and not much opportunity to move around even though it is touted as such
good,"As a Salesforce administrator I was responsible for maintaining/deploying code and configuring six production environments and ninety non-production environments  This included all administrative duties, integration with our legacy systems, and maintaining security certificates throughout the companies infrastructure."
good,"Own business and own boss is a plus but income is not steady. It is a tough business. I came from another state, so was hard to compete with agents already established in the area."
good,"I interned at Farmers during college and had an extremely flexible schedule. "
good,"The company offers excellent benefits to its employees. Overall the company culture is positive, however, there is a constant struggle occurring between internal employees and external contractors."
good,"Catastrophe insurance adjusting is not for everyone.  Long hours, questionable working conditions, horror life stories from customers, and all kids of job fulfillment knowing we helped a family in need."
good,Property and casualty insurance is limited in nature and not a ton of products to sell. commissions are good but once I was introduced to the insurance products and commissions at Northwestern it was an easy decision to leave farmer's
good,"Employees good people. Provides opportunities for advancement. A lot of the companies focus is on it's core products and trying to compete with other companies offering the same products and services. They are playing catch-up in their systems area, as their technology is several years behind the leaders in the industry."
good,"I found that once candidates find out what goals they have to meet as a new agent, most decide it's the not right career path for them.  It was hard for me to recruit when people were not interested in meeting the specific goals Farmers required of them.   It was a pleasant workplace and the coworkers were very nice though."
good,"Farmers is a great place to work but just like any other employer , the management makes all the difference. At the beginning of my Farmers stent, My manager was great, however after being hired on permanently , I was forced to go to a new manager who was not so great."
good,"Great place to start in the insurance industry. Employees are eager to help and boss is easy to get along with, hours are fair and flexible to work with schedules."
good,Good place to work. No room to advance.  I do not really want to say a lot about it on this.Farmers was flexible if you need time off for anything. There was only three employees including myself.
good,They offer a very flexible schedule. Pay is inline with other insurance providers. Full medical benefits and retirement are offered as well. They provide training and constant updates with regards to the claim handling.
good,"Competent management and very thorough training provided.  Fast paced and always have something to do.  Never a dull moment."
good,"My overall expierence is not bad but the initial training and continued training was unorganized, and very thrown together at the last minute, as well as lacking in follow through as well. Company seems unorganized altogether. Culture of the company is portrayed as employee focused and all about work life balance but this is not the case."
good,"Excellent benefits, poor management, morale of the workplace just wasn't there. Zero appreciation for their employees. Played favorites and took credit for your work. The agents were not trained properly making it difficult on the insured."
good,There are really nice people and the management cares about you as an individual. When you start you have to bid for the shift you want and there's not a guarantee you will get what works best for you or your family.
good,"Auto claims adjuster is hard work, but the company is very flexible with your work schedule which makes it easier to do your job."
good,"As a small business owner, I am responsible for the growth and success of my agency.  This includes hiring and managing staff, daily operations, lead generation, sales and managing a client book of business."
good,"Farmers Insurance definitely works hard to ensure that their employees work hard. They are constantly reaching out and upgrading their locations to ensure that their employees have a place to relax during break times and are effective during work times. While their company strives for employee happiness, they fail to keep a competitive pay. It is a good job for a single person right out of school that does not yet have any bills or responsibilities; however, the pay is not worth the work once you have more life responsibilities."
good,It was always busy with a lot of team activity and team goals to meet. I personally like a smaller office but this place of employment taught me to get a long with everyone and I met really great people.
good,"Good learning experience. Great way to start in the insurance business. Met some really great customers, and great co workers"
good,On a typical day I review customers home and auto policies to help resolve any customer complaints or concerns. I enjoy helping our customers alleviate there concerns and expand our relationship with them. I love that my management team gives me the freedom to do what is best for the customer.
good,"I loved bartending there, but in the end needed to find a position that offered better hours and more growth potential. I wouldn't consider it a career, but it definitely was a great place to work for a very long time."
good,"I've learned how to run a business from beginning to end.  Contracts, bank account, accounts receivable, management, supply chain, marketing, sales, staffing and much more.  Everything to run a small business I've successfully experienced and learned.  All aspects of business are involved in being an agency owner."
good,Farmers pays well and offers great healthcare benefits.  Good job security: average tenure is 15+ years.  Nice and modern facilities in new corporate location in Woodland Hills.
good,"Starting in the call center, you must prove yourself able to take on any other role in the company.  There is room for advancement, but mostly as a casualty adjuster in the auto side if you don't have any previous experience."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was helping returning customers. I learned to treat the customers as I would like to be treated.
good,Looking for an opportunity for a balanced work home life this is the place. You work harder your pay increases.
good,Being a business owner proved to be very demanding as well as rewarding. I loved working with my customers and was fortunate to have great district managers to work with.
good,Productive and fun work environment. Grew exponentially as a sales professional.
good,A wonderful place to work the only reason I left was I was given a promotion from another company
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the fact that I felt very productive at work. I learned a lot of additional information about insurance.
good,I worked in a small office with 2 agents. Insurance is an extremely competitive market. It was really fun when we were able to help people save money. Some days were challenging when there were a lot of claims or rates increased.
good,"I've learned to multi-task more efficiently than ever. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible hours and lunches. Hardest part of the job is the cubicle environment, you are on the computer all day isolated from your coworkers aside from the ones surrounding you. There are opportunities to socialize, but that would take away from your production overall."
good,"appointments,phonecalls,telemarking. continue to try no matter what happens. Must being in good relationship with management in order to succeed. co-workers nice people easy to get along with. looking for new aspects. success in finding clients."
good,"A typical work day includes working newly assigned claims as well as previous ones in your current workload. Speaking with our insureds, claimants, attorneys and other carriers is a common occurance via phone, email or written correspondance in order to settle claims. Our current management team freguently struggles communicating with the employees. There is very little contact between the management and the employess. The Subrogation dept as a whole for the last 3yrs has been mismanaged to the point that we are being eliminated in the Phoenix area while thriving in other parts of the country. I have appreciated the fact Farmers has allowed me to alter my work schedule around being a parent and won't forget that. However I don't feel that our dept as a whole has been put in a position to succeed."
good,they are like car sales people.
good,"A typical day at work is always busy, answering phones, and greeting customers. I learn a lot a of things. Everyday you learn something new and the more you learn, the more you memorize. Management is nice, steady, and fast pace. My co-workers are great! Fun to work with and to be around. The hardest part of my job is when I feel like our clients are dissatisfied with our work? I feel like we can always help and let them know we are here. Sometimes, its sad to lose clients. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you get attached with insureds. They know you and once you gain their trust, they always ask for you."
good,"I spend my days analyzing, preparing,maintain general and subsidiary ledgers and financial statements. My co-workers are fun and energetic. The management has been a joy to work with so far."
good,"Due to the economic hardships, the company is experiencing tight budget cuts. There is little to no advancement at this time. Overall, I love my team, supervisor, and manager. My desire to find a new job is due to me pursuing further education in Health Care Administration and I would like to get my foot in the health care industry."
good,I was told that anything that occurred at the company was confidential and shouldn't be shared with anyone.
good,I like to work for Farmers the main concern is the job security what I don't have.
good,Owned the insurance agnecy; but had to close it because of a divorce.
good,"Stressful job, supervisor is always wanting better numbers. Pay is decent and management is ok. You have to be pretty chill to make it day to day. Not something I would recommend for a long time."
good,A very busy insurance office manned by only two customer service representatives. Manager/owner's presence is part-time. No opportunity for advancement.
good,"HR protect bad people managers. The way people managers are trained is very inconsistent, it's a lottery, with many reorganisations of departments which leads to many forced teams."
good,I have been working here for just over a year. So far I jave enjoyed the challenge and look forward to new challenges that I will face. It has been really flexible with my lifestyle.
good,I have been mostly satisfied with my tenure at Farmers Insurance. I have handled the second most claims in the state the past 3 years and do not understand why my job has been eliminated. My KPI's are second highest in the state for the third consecutive year. I would rate them low as they have eliminated employees and more cuts are coming next year and everyone is fearful that their jobs will be eliminated
good,Have had a lot of fun working here and meeting great people. The company really pushes for the advancement of their employees. Offers tuition reimbursement and plenty of advancement opportunities.
good,"The company has a wonderful mission and vision. It’s front line leaders and mid level managers fail to live that mission. "
good,"Started out as a great business opportunity, but quickly turned to disappointment. Company did not protect it's agencies from cannibalization from a terminated agent."
good,"We were given 2 15 minute breaks and 1/2 hour lunch. We had a cafeteria and patio to use for our breaks. "
good,"Job relocated out of state, otherwise I would not have left the company. Good company to work for, if you're living in the correct location unfortunately."
good,"Good place to work.  Pay is on commission only, so income varies depending on sales month.  Training very thorough, including out of state continuing education paid for by the company"
good,A great place to work. The workplace environment is like nothing you've seen before. The job itself is very stressful so the people you work with are a huge part of the job. The pay and benefits are great too
good,"the hours absolutely suck!!!!!!! They say its a full time job but, only give you 12 hours a week. plus $1 commission per quote sheet your get. but, the boss is so nice as well as everyone that works in the office. they let you just work and they don't breathe over your shoulder."
good,"I found typical days at Farmers Home Office Underwriting to be mentally challenging. As well as providing support for the general service staff in 4+ offices, we were required to work our own assigned duties. The multi-tasking and balancing of these priorities was not always simple. Additional projects and requests added to the mental exercises."
good,"Promotions are generally made from within with plenty of growth opportunities. However, this sometimes leads to managers having little, if any, previous experience."
good,I like the fact that I work for a well known company and has locations everywhere.  In my experience with all previous Insurance jobs I must say Farmers Insurance has been the best insurance company I have worked for.
good,MY typical day would consist of answering the phone and responding to emails and customer requests. I learned a lot about insurance and the varies coverage's and types of insurances. Management was not there too much nor was there much training. The hardest part of my job was trying to sell to insurance to new customers because sometimes our prices were more than the competition.
good,Great environment to work in if you are in college. Not very professional in terms of things at the office or the district offices. As with all large companies there is a lot of corruption and it really depends on the certain agency.
good,I learned a lot from this job. Mainly that it was a place to send claims to be handled the fastest way possible.Worked claims that were non injury. Usually got about 70 a day.
good,"•	Proving service to agency clients"
good,Great place to start my programming career as it had a good training program. Worked hard and was rewarded with good reviews that enabled me to advance my career.
good,"Great supportive staff who is eager to watch you succeed. "
good,"Work was good there was room for advancement but no security."
good,"In general, people are not excited about paying for auto/home/life insurance.  I always felt bad, as rates would rise with every renewal, even if there were no tickets, accidents, or claims.  Customers would call and complain and although I was sympathetic, there was not a lot I could do."
good,Great place to work; great people to work with. Dealing with the general public makes the job difficult and stressful.
good,I represented Farmers and sold their products but I contracted with them and was never an employee of Farmers. They as a good company with good product and I had no problem representing them or their products. Very large company and sold almost every product that I ever needed.
good,"My day starts at 12:30am right after lunch. I beguin with running start when I hit the desk. Checking messages, following up on the duties that need completion from the previous day, answering the phone, taking messages, and reviewing updates with our work load. I work directly under the agent assisting in sales, managing policies, and retaining our book of business. The hardest part of the day is problem solving. How to satisfy everyone within our guidelines and regulations. Its challanging but I have learned how to think outside of the box while being able to complete these duties and send clients away happy at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is making some one completely content using my customer service skills we offer at the Sanchez Agency. "
good,new business with new problems.
good,The job was a temporary position for the Farmers Insurance Group. Due to being 3 months behind after buying another insurance companies claims. We were brought in through temporary positions to help scan and index claims from 3 months before.
good,Company is very good with promotions/ advancement. Co-workers made it fun to come to work.
good,"Call customers to offer Insurance,"
good,A typical day at work involves answering telephone calls and setting up phone appointments with clients or prospective clients to assist them in current or potential insurance policies.
good,"While we are told that there is an open door policy and new ideas are welcome, management doesn't follow up. Workers who keep their head down and do their jobs without asking questions are sought after. Current work model i s different from other big companies ==progressive, state farm, geico, etc. Current work model is not efficient for employees. Management is approachable but those who approach are not valued."
good,I worked as an adjuster while at the same time working with my fellow interns on a project that would in some way improve the Olathe Farmers branch. I learned what a real world job schedule felt like and how working on a corporate project worked. The culture was family liked while you weren't working. I didn't feel like a lesser member of the team because I was an intern which I appreciated. The hardest part of the job was there was a lot of downtime and the most enjoyable part was still feeling like I was contributing on a low level position.
good,Farmers Insurance Group had an environment in which I was comfortable. Goals were properly articulated and action plans made it all the easier to achieve states goals.
good,agents are and professional environment is like a family to me and always accepting to my needs and services. The pay is good and work is simple and have to learn to adapt to customer needs and let them know up front.
good,"Farmers was very stable in the way they trained you, monitored you, assisted you and developed you. Many times you would run into roadblocks based on their lack of available opportunities. They have a good model but a lot is missing within their culture. They do not have an inclusive culture and that can create unnecessary stress on diverse hires."
good,i had went in at midnight and 1 am then typical shift was 10 hours a day for 4 days a week. hardest part was getting up for work.  management was amazing.
good,"Everyone at Farmers is really nice and helpful. Amount of PTO is nice and can easily take them. Good benefits with 401k with no vesting period. "
good,"I worked 40 hours a week, but the recession hit the economy and the manager had to start laying staff off. The recession came as a surprise to the manager."
good,Typical day would be 9:00 am to 7:00 pm.  You put a lot of miles on personal vehicle.  Developed many types of marketing that I was comfortable with and successful in meeting potential customers.  Management was dedicated in making sales team successful.  Good workplace culture.  The hardest part of job was trying to sell products that were non-competitive in marketplace.  Enjoyed meeting customers and educating them about insurance products.
good,Company is 100% survey driven for metrics. Solid company with strong marketing and claims divisions. Very customer oriented with multiple variations and matrix options to provide which allows great flexibility.
good,"Gerat boss, he was very helpful and made the job easy for me. It was only part time but I liked the environment, very quiet and peaceful."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with. Regardless of the pressures of making goals every day, the group of people I worked with made the job tolerable."
good,"Farmers is all about having their people constantly learn about the insurance industry, which is rewarded once criteria are met. Everyone is willing to help someone out, even the newbs. The insurance industry just wasn't for me. Being yelled at and cussed out by claimants and farmers insureds was ridiculous, plus arguing with attorneys and their reps is just draining. Claims reps are salary, so a lot of hours for mediocre pay and high stress. The training was like 10 weeks and 2 of those are spent in LA, which didn't seem necessary. I dreaded every day wondering what i was going to have to deal with..it actually started affecting my personal life."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing customers the benefit of a full coverage affordable insurance, and first hand customer service."
good,"Gathering information from clients, assessing their insurance needs and risk profile and foreseeing clients' insurance needs, such as policy renewals."
good,"Unless you want to stay in claims, you need to move to another state."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. A little uncertainty and unrealistic goals for the future of the company which tend to change annually or with CEOs. Really tight knit ""Farmers Family"" that you build with co-workers which makes the thought of leaving a little more difficult. Claims positions, like with any insurance company, are difficult in general and require a certain personality and level of patience/tolerance. Not everyone is meant to handle claims, but if you can power through the difficult days/weeks/months, perform well, and you strive for 110% rather than just meeting expectations, you will be rewarded and recognized. Love the people that I work with, hate the customers/claimants that think insurance companys are cash cows.... FYI.... Insurance companys are meant to compensate for a financial loss and pay what is owed - nothing more, nothing less - they are not a source of income and just because you are unemployed or upside down on a loan does not mean that you are financially worse off because of a loss... It is called an accident for a reason and is going to happen to everyone at some point in thier lives."
good,Worked with some amazing clients and employees which are still friends to this day. Great hours and great pay. Loved the independence of this job.
good,"Excellent company for those who pursue stability in position, without much corporate change to impact the actual work. However, the management and culture lack ability to change and adopt to the employees needs."
good,I did not like working at this place due to the distance it was from my home of residence and the fact that you were constantly on the phone for 8 hrs a day having people yell at you.
good,Would be a great opportunity for someone who can give it their all. I didn't work there that long because it would have taken awhile to establish a good base income and I had obligations that needed to be taken care of at that time.
good,The small agency that I worked for allowed for me to come in after school and get a few hours of work. The only reason I left was because I was not properly trained to do the tasks that I was being asked to do.
good,"i would recommend anyone to work for farmers Insurance the only problem that they have is they are very picky with whom they insure, their rates are kinda high right now too."
good,"This position did not work well with my current financial situation being hired as a location, independent contractor due to the fact that I have no prior insurance experience,"
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to find something to do for eight hours. The reason I said that is because my boss didn't have anything for me to do.
good,"fun place to work, co-workers are nice , boss is great, and location is perfect, always plenty of work to do, which is a good thing, because no one likes to be bored at work"
good,"A typical day is checking emails, sending emails, sitting in on capacity meetings, and updating the activity calendars with events such as training, local and site wide meetings requested from the training department and leadership.  I've learned that time management is ""everything"" in this role.  Management is supportive at times.  My co-workers are nice people but need to understand that cohesion is necessary when working together.  The hardest part of my job is getting coworkers on board with what's expected of the role in my department.  The most enjoyable parts of the job are the people and the flexibility of my role."
good,Professional environment in which multiple calls are being dealt with one at a time. Connecting old customers with new services and attending all possible complaints as well.
good,"For a typical day at work, I would proof check automobile titles and any additional title paperwork for accuracy. I also monitored work flow and adjusted work flow among staff members if needed. The management team was like my second family. They were there for support, advice, and guidance. I knew the co-workers for years so they were like family too."
good,Received assignments for the day on a time line. Would reach out to the customers to assure the appointment was good for them. Meet with customers and complete estimates on vehicles. Also completed total losses
good,"I love working here at Farmers, but their rates are going up on just about everything and I'm losing customers it seems like every day. Outside of that I love what I'm doing and enjoy being with the company."
good,"A typical day at work includes making phone calls to set up interviews, holding various interviews, reviewing my candidates I have in line. I learned that this is a sales job to prepare and excite candidates about eventually opening up their own business with all the support and financial compensation you will need to help it run."
good,answer in bound calls and make outbound calls to prospective clients all day. Answer clients questions and take payments and set up sales interviews for head Agent. Sell home owners and auto insurance.
good,Answered phone calls all day long regarding billing issues for the foremost specialty division of Farmers Insurance. Workplace was a sea of cubicles. management was helpful and wanted to help you succeed.
good,"I worked at Farmers Insurance for my school internship. My job was to cold call and quote customers that were quoted a few months or years back . I would also quote current customers on their car and house insurance. Self-motivated job, but many customers complain & are angry. I only had to complete 180 hours for school."
good,"worked 60+ hours a week with no corporate support, no insurance or benefits, commission based business with no marketing training. monthly classes on building a business and how to market effectively"
good,"The work environment was great it was the favoritism with the supervisor with other employees was not good at all, actually it brought down morale with all my other coworkers."
good,"A great job to have, lots of responsibilities yet rewarding.  Some bonuses were skipped and promises were not kept. Manager not completely honest and changes were made."
good,"I worked for an agent, I was commission only, which was horrible because I made next to nothing at all. I worked for a new agent who knew nothing, so had to teach myself. I am not sure of how other agents pay."
good,"flexible schedule, no weekend work, pretty slow at times, hard to get the hang of things at first, very understanding of my school schedule, overall nice work but poor pay for amount of work."
good,"I've enjoyed being a part of the Farmers Family, but after 20 years, I would like to start a new adventure and put my customer service skills to work as well as my data entry and computer skills!"
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers and agents on a daily basis. The job is very tedious and time consuming. There's very few opportunities within the company without the willingness to relocate.
good,If you are a favored employee at Farmers you can go all the way to the top I had three substantiated cases for discrimination in the last four years I love this job and looking for another job makes me very sad but I am tired of being more qualified that the people that are promoted. so yeah
good,I enjoy working for Farmers as a whole. The district management team is very open and willing to help and train employees and assist with questions when needed.
good,"I loved working at farmers for the time being. The only thing I can say didn't work for me was the lack of moving up and trying to make more money, the office I worked for had no opportunity to do so. Therefore when I learned everything about my position I needed more of a challenge and growth as well and when there is none of that it was time for me to move on to something that can do just that for me."
good,I did enjoy  working with farmer's insurance agents. unfortunately their is no room to growth within the company if not an insurance agent yourself . If willing to become an agent you can open your own insurance office and that is always something to think about .
good,"I would arrive early, and get my coffee and review customers I need to contact for the day and follow ups for quotes recently completed. I would do my follow up work first and then do my morning calls to prospective customers. A few more follow ups and then another block of call time until lunch. After lunch I would do additional follow ups quotes and or appointments, followed by the best block of call time from 4 to 6:30 or 7 pm in the evening. Management was helpful, and educational, but tended to micro manage or be offensive at times, although I don't think he intended to be, but he was. I learned allot about time management, being efficient and better sales approaches. The hardest part of the job for me was getting quotes closed and getting enough sales to avoid pay cuts. The hours were much to long for the level of compensation I recieved. To be fair he does offer allot of bonuses and incentives, but they can be hard to achieve. The best part of the job was working with my co workers and customers. I truly love customer service work!"
good,"Working sometime more than just Saturdays even on Sundays"
good,Unless you absolutely have a passion for competitiveness insurance area is the place for you. Was not for me always running and figuring numbers for members.
good,Fun place to work i would have stayed in the compensation was there but it is difficult to do that on that specific wage. The job was not well defined and everyone wanted me to walk hold their hand through THEIR jobs.
good,learned a lot of different roles had responsibilities and enjoyed the challenging aspects of the organization
good,"Company had poor management but I am glad for the experience of working in a defense law firm."
good,Training was great. The in classroom and web classes were very helpful. Farmers gave you the tools to succeed. It is a company I trust and believe in.
good,The company and its structure aregreat. Finding an agent to work for and with prices to be difficult and challenging. I’ve been privileged to work for two fantastic agents in two different states. I worked for a third agent in another state with abysmal results.
good,This company suffers from folks that play political games. Some of the Management staff play petty games to mess with people . I would not recommend working for this company
good,"Insurance business is super competitive. The typical work day consist of cold calling and setting up appointments to meet with potential clients. Selling skills is a must, if you want to make money in this business."
good,Not flexible with schedules and they do not care about your family life. The job itself isnt bad but its just a very tense environment.The pay is also below normal fpr this position.
good,"This job can be stressful and competitive at times but has many perks as well. The work environment is fast paced, detailed oriented, customer service friendly."
good,I learned a lot while working at Farmers Insurance. My communication skills were put to the test when dealing with clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my other coworkers and becoming a successful when working with a team.
good,This was a Part Time job. The culture at Farmers is relaxed except when quotas are needed to be met. The Territory manager is constantly on the agent's back trying to get more Life Insurance policies.
good,"Farmers is a decent company to work for. They try to help their agents succeed, but their premiums are higher than most and they do not do much to help you maintain your current clients."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and the incoming calls were diverse in nature .This the most interesting part of the job. "
good,"Very micro-managed. Rules of management changed everyday according to their moods when they rated calls."
good,This is a great place to work if you're ok with the job you have. I learned a lot about sales and people management thanks to a great manager myself and co-workers.
good,Keep busy with paperwork and customer coming in and calling.  I have learned alot about insurance in the 12 years I have worked at Farmers and of course there is always changes.  Love my co workers.
good,"Answering phone calls, reviewing resumes and setting up interviews for District Manager."
good,It's a competitive business and the people are tough to work with at times.
good,A typical day consists of contacting people who have inquired about insurance for their cars.
good,"I would set up the training room, train the new agents, train the new office workers, work up quotes, set appointments for investigators and repair shops, write reports and submit to homeoffice."
good,"A typical day includes processing the written and verbal requests of the agents as well as customers who stop by or call in. Whether completing a quote, changing coverages or handling billing, there is always something to be done and to learn in this fast paced environment. My co-workers are some of the most fun people I have had the pleasure to work with. Navigating through the new agents each quarter, learning their work and teaching them proper company protocol for policy processing has proven both challenging and rewarding. My most enjoyable job moments are those where I can satisfy the needs of the customer. "
good,This was my own agency as an independent contractor with Farmers Insurance Group. It was a interesting experience as a business owner and an entrepeneur. It helped me mature an endeavor in a broader network of professionalism representing various daily challenges of growth.
good,"I answer the phone, email and write new policies on the daily basis. The hardest part of this job is I work alone in the office, so there re no people, managers around me at all. I enjoy working with customers, educating them and finding whats right for them."
good,worked a 10 hrs shift
good,"Beautiful Atmosphere  Caring Supervisor-Agent.  Slow-pace work you just do data entry. Answer phones, and take payments from customers . Good Company to work for."
good,"management stinks, they set unrealistic expectations, eventually they might let you work from home, they don't pay enough for the overload of work that they give"
good,Farmers is great company with a lot of opportunity. you have to make sure you are always on your toes and doing everything to your best ability while working fast
good,boring and sedentary job. 
good,"We were a positive, competent team serving our customers fully."
good,"This review is a little unfair as I worked in a little office with one insurance agent, who was phenomenal, however, Farmers as a company is a shark tank. Working in the corporate office as a marketer for two months made me realize this job is not for the faint of the heart."
good,Made appts and confirmed appts for agents. As well made cold calls for potential new clients for the office. I was also in charge to make bank deposits about 3 times a week for the office. I made sure the office was clean by taking out the trash and dusting the office.
good,"Constantly changing and evolving after purchasing 21 st Century. Upper management has continually changed as well, whereby changing the method of establishing employee goals. Expanding the territory but did not hire additional employees to handle the influx of new claims and new procedures with limited training on the new states. This company has it's employees salaried and while you are very flexible, you are expected to work as long as it takes to get the daily routine done.  It is especially challenging when there are employees on vacation, sick leave or simply  high volume periods."
good,"My supervisor's book of business was very large. We had numerous phone calls to attend to daily. The phone rang most of the time at regular intervals of 2-3 minutes throughout the day and often until after closing as well. We assisted many walk-in clients that were both in our book of business and many of whom belonged to other agents as well. They either had policy questions, needed to make a payment or desired to make changes to an existing policy. We also regularly serviced prospective clients needing quotes and shopping for renter's, homeowner's, auto, motorcycle, mobile home, RV, and boat polices. I also assisted clients in many ways such as securing bonds or with DMV issues that were outside of our normal scope of business. "
good,"Clocked in and started my computer system, soon after id help clients to open new policies, take payments or renew their policies. typical day.  I learned new auto insurance rules and helped clients to choose the best policy. I had only one co-worker and she was a sweet girl., taught me what i learned and till this day we keep in touch.  Hardest part of my job was that i was getting very lil hours. I was a single parent with 3 children at the time so I knew I needed more hours. Enjoyable part was that my boss and his wife were so nice and understanding and co-worker. They were very much Family oriented."
good,Not enough pay for the work that was required.  Was going to school while working.
good,"Nice friendly staff, learned the insurance system and A/R and A/P system. Management are friendly and caring. Hardest part of the job was the A/R and A/P system. Most enjoyable part of the job was all the clients i got to know and enjoyed speaking with"
good,Farmers Insurance taught temps as well as full time employees
good,"Being honest, if you want to succeed at Farmers, you are definitely going to need sales experience and a firm network of people when you start. You are pretty much required to build your own book of business, despite what you are told about getting 'warm' leads. The staff itself is absolutely fine, but unless you are near the office and can get your customers to come to Schaumburg, don't exactly expect anyone to be available to help out when it's convenient for you. Remember that there are at least 10-15 other agents competing for their time."
good,I ran the office by myself every morning and learned as I went.  I taught my boss alot about insurance because I had the experience and she did not.  Most time was spent on the phone and doing paperwork.  The book of business was tough but I enjoyed the challenge.
good,"Pros: Very family friendly atmosphere. "
good,"CEO for full line financial services and insurance agency.  Scope of responsibility included all sales, marketing, operational, administrative and customer management/retention operations throughout agency."
good,"I was offered a position with Farmers and I took it because I was trying out a change in career away from retail. I took both my online and state exams to apply for the license, but by the time I reached that stage I knew it wasn't something that I wanted to do at that time."
good,I enjoyed working at my own pace. I enjoyed managing the office and organizing my week to function with me and my schedule. i enjoyed talking to regular customers.
good,"The company itself is great! but it depends on which agent you work with. You want to work the agent that gives you the drive to work harder every day. "
good,I can not comment on working for Farmers Insurance group as I worked for an agency with an agent who offered Farmers Insurance. Back then you weren't required to have an insurance license therefore I was the front desk lady who took in bound and out bound calls for the agent I worked for.
good,A typical day at work was based mostly on taking calls from customers. The most rewarding part for me was ending with an extremely satisfied customer.
good,"They painted a great picture for you and then send ""YOU"" to insurance school with the state at ""your"" expense! if I had $100,000"
good,"Overall this was an easy and enjoyable job, unfortunately the person I worked for took advantage of me being there and never allowed to me to advance after telling me I would be."
good,"This was pretty much the same routine day in and day out. Writing insurance policies, calling on bills that were due and taking payments from walk in customers. I enjoyed most the customer interactions."
good,Farmers is an Equal opportunity Employer.    Farmers is a Great company to work.   They are a tough company as far as Work home balance due to being a 24/7 Facility
good,Overall laid back company  to work for. I have enjoyed the opportunity granted. Everyone is friendly and professional. There is room for growth. I like the flexibility of schedule.
good,This job was productive and quite extensive in its applications but rewarding. The Main Boss hardly took any constructive criticism but still expected the demands to be met and were met.
good,"While I appreciated the opportunity I was given, being a recent college graduate, the 100% commission proved to be too big of a hurdle to overcome while still trying to achieve personal goals with my wife. Goals such as starting a family and buying a house were not in sight with the strain of self-employment taxes, business expenses, and 100% commission. Things would likely be different if you have the money and time to invest, but as a recent college graduate, I found it increasingly hard to ""survive"" the upd and downs while still providing for my family."
good,I worked for an agent who was never in office consistently cancelled appointments never properly trained me on programs I got my license and a month later she left for maternity leave I ran office for 10 months on my own til she came back working 16 hours a month before I left office
good,Handle customer needs and services as requested or required on a daily basis. Handled proprietary information and managed information via paper or data entry as needed.
good,"I enjoyed the idea of having my own agency, I wanted to own my own business.  Going in and speaking to the recruiter was an ok experience.  They sell you on the idea of having your agency but I was not informed of all the details.  This was a new recruiter and a new office.  I had some question but they were not able to answer them all.  I realized it and I knew there was some unknown.  You are really going to have to have the time to put into this, which I did not have.  I had circumstances at home that did not allow me to complete the program.  This IS NOT a scam, but you will need to work.  The subsidy will need to be put toward your agency.  If you are the breadwinner of the family you may struggle.  If you do not have any other income coming in, be prepared to be broke.  Its work and you can do it.  You will probably end up needing to buy leads as well because you will exhaust your natural market quickly."
good,Worked in several departments and learned a lot about all types of insurance
good,"Answering phones, helping customers, taking payments, over the phone quotes. Letting people know all farmers insurance had to offer"
good,I enjoyed working for Farmers Insurance. Lots of client interaction by phone and face to face. Liked visiting with clients.
good,you get to place your self in customers shoes and pay more attention to the bills and why it has change. Its a great place to gain skills for customer service.
good,creating quotes was fun. Getting to know customers and their specific needs was cool. Learning about insurance was very interesting.
good,"I learned from these many positions at this organization, how to lead and manage.  I also learned how to train and teach others.  I learned how to create promotions and events with the ability to raise a substantial amount for charities.  I learned how to multitask.  "
good,Heavy training so you are prepared. Voluntary overtime and workload.
good,The job is good. It is a challenge and in a competitive market where people see insurance as a comodity. It has great potential but 50% of your income need to be put back into the business. It is a great career for people who have time to build it over a 5 to 10 years period.
good,"Farmers was a great place to work for when I first got the job, they had a good proven system that was reliable and I loved going to work there every day. The people I worked with were great and there was a good sense of community. Things have changed to more of a micro management style when is anything but healthy for the office."
good,I learned something new everyday. Our company merged with Zurich and all the smaller claims offices were closed.
good,The co-workers were very friendly but the job was very mind-numbing. Being behind the phone for hours and repeating the same line would get very irritating and the management of the office was not up to balanced standards in my opinion.
good,"Busy handling all customer service and building a good relationship with our clients. Learned the insurance business, binding policies. Easy going atmosphere, work equally well in a team environment or independently with minimum supervision. The hardest part of the job was calling our service department and not getting the proper information withing our policies. The clients were my enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I have earned many things working with this company. A lot of which I was not aware of until started working here. A typical day at work would be busy. Continously answering customer calls, maintenancing accounts, data entry and giving impeccable customer service on a daily basis. The management is great and very helpful as well as my co-workers. The most difficult part of the job is being able to learn everything at once. I am a quick learner and working for an insurance company is great but it is a lot to learn but i enjoy learning new things. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting all the clients and creating a relationship with them, Being able to assist them with any questions and concerns and making them leave with a smile is certainly joyful."
good,"This agent was looking for an experienced sales /customer service person. Professional and experienced with Insurance but was a new Agent."
good,Depending on the department the culture varies and the leaders can be lack luster. They pay very well but there is little done in the way of moral for the employees
good,"Working in the District Office was both a blessing and a curse. Our District Manager was a task master that very seldom gave out any positive feedback, to anyone. As such, the stress level in the office was always high which made doing your job that much harder. Farmers is a great company to work for, but this particular office was tough."
good,"I would say that farmers insurance is a great place to work. Its a large company with great benefits and the amount of paid time off allotted to employees is incomparable. However, the company has undergone some drastic changes since the time that I first began working there in 2011. Changes in management, changes in work ethic, structural changes as well. I worked for the Legal side of farmers insurance and somewhere along the lines i began to wish i had started on the claims. I still believe the company has the potential to be a great place to work, however, it is currently not a place I could recommend."
good,"Farmers offers a lot of learning and training opportunities for individuals starting out. If you're looking to get started in insurance or just want to see if it's for you, it would be a great starting point."
good,"Good company to work for, depending on the owner. If you can get the hang of insurance, they help guide you to eventually become an agent. Great learning experience."
good,The job was extremely easy and didn't take many skills.  The biggest issue was the pay being low and not having any benefits.  I needed something with benefits.
good,"I learned so much, while the pay was good, the hours were not enough. The people were great and customers appreciative. While I did not have the best pay, I did learn how to run a business,"
good,"This company is great to work for if you are ok with being stand still in a career. I am ready to move forward in my positions as lead producer and can do more. The boss is for the most part hands off but, when he tries to be hands on he does not know what he is doing anymore. I love working with customers and that they are able to come into my office and sit down with me and talk things over. The one on one connection that I am able to help them is great. The hardest part about my job is managing my boss. My boss for the most part great at being a boss, but does not know how to be an employee."
good,"Like State Farm, Farmers compensation does not cover the average new agent overhead and expense. You will spend a lot of your personal savings to keep your doors open."
good,"Company is struggling to keep up with the industry.  Many changes were taking place to change the commission structure of agents, while trying to be competitive in the marketplace."
good,"Very beautiful new building, but a call center environment nonetheless. The cubicles do not provide any sense of privacy, causing the noise level to be difficult to ignore while on with Customers and vendors. The supervisor are allowed free range to 'micro manage' as they choose, therefore the morale, and overall output amongst the teams will vary greatly."
good,"Poor staffing, stressful, not enough time in the week to keep up with work load. Lots of PTO. Management in the auto claims department is poor. High turn over rate."
good,"Farmers as a whole is a very cut throat business, promises were not fulfilled and there was no follow through. It was a difficult position to be in as a recruiter in that it was never explained to prospective agents that there would be out of pocket expenses, including astronomical up front fees little could afford."
good,Had a bad experience when I became sick and needed to be out for a week. They ended up letting me go unless I came in that day with a doctors note. I was in the hospital
good,"Great experience , I learned cross-selling different products , "
good,"Farmers is going through a transformation and is thus unsure of their needs.  They have a plan to become a player in the financial planning facet of the business; however, no clear path is being given by the upper management."
good,"Generally a good company to work for - good potential to move up/around to other positions and higher pay; however if you have young children, marriage or any type of outside life that requires time off, or god forbid, you fall ill, they are not so understanding. As I said, typical call center environment. They also don't pay as much as the other top insurance companies."
good,"Depends on the district manager. Various district offices in the country.  No health insurance, 401k...   Limited growth opportunity. But, again it all depends on the district."
good,I like to help our customers in all their needs and also explaining the coverage to them answer all their questions that they must have or guide them to the right place. Try to see if I can save them in their policies.
good,"During the time I worked there, the office only consisted of two people total. At times it was only myself in the office. Farmers is a great insurance company. Do not base the company on the size of its independent agencies."
good,"Only 3 employees "
good,"Working at farmers was very rewarding, there is a lot of room to grow can definitely make a career even if you only tart of as a customer service representative. The hardest part was probably keeping track of all the people that you need to follow up on."
good,"A typical day at work will be busy, but organization is key to make your day go by at a smoother rate."
good,"family business, laid back. while working for the Chuck Duran agency i learned about insurance policy's, how to file claims. the management was decent not by the book. my co-workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was answering the phone, i was told different ways to answer and would get confused."
good,"self driven day with ability to work through goals at your own pace "
good,"A typical day at work is very detailed and hard to complete in 8 hours:"
good,Good company to work for. You meet interesting people and learn a lot about the insurance business. Co-workers are great. I learned a more clear picture as to what goes into an insurance policy
good,"I enjoyed to relationships that I was able to create with clients. I also enjoyed helping people with any problem that they had. The most difficult part of my job was dealing with agree customer that I could not calm down. I liked that i could keep busy day to day with filing, answering phone call, making changes to policies, greeting customer, and replying to emails."
good,"The main problem is the employees with over 20 yrs experience are targeted for removal because they are a part of the pension and retirement program and the younger employees are not.  You have no protection if you are working in an ""at will"" state."
good,"chaotic with no advancement or raise. some co-workers were great, others were not. it was a good, temporary position. thank you"
good,Great business opportunity. Must be financially stable in order to succeed.
good,Working for the largest agent in his territory had it's benefits but also downfalls.  We were very busy trying to keep existing clients from leaving due to massive rate increases so it left little to no time to market to new clients.
good,This office focuses on the personal attention to each and every client
good,"Great job with a lot of interaction with people!"
good,This is a challenging position for someone who is looking to be independent.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with clientele.  The most difficult part of the job is creating sales in a poor economy.
good,"A typical day starts at 7:00 am and ends at 5:00 pm"
good,"A typical day usually included being in the office by 8 am. I did have the opportunity to learn how to run a business. My manager in particular was great, however senior leadership within the company seemed out of touch with the people in the field doing the hard work."
good,"Very busy atmosphere with heavy emphasis on micro-management. Some people handle this atmosphere very well and not so much for others. If you handle the typical ""call center"" atmosphere well, then this would be a great place to consider employment."
good,"My boss was amazing, he had his whole family in the office working with him though. They were difficualt to work with and made my job harder. I was hored to do marketing and ended up working in the office with prior clients and preparing proposals for new ones."
good,liked working in group setting and liked to talk to the people in a fast paced work environment
good,Farmers was my first adventure into corprate life. Because the job was working through a temp agency it was not very secure nor did I have the abilaty to move up in the company.
good,"Tough to make it.  average support, high rates so not competitive against most other companies.  Claims are great and customers get taken care of."
good,"i have work with nice and good environment people, good leadership, i was able to help clients with their issues and making wise decisions. I enjoy working with my coworkers."
good,"Inspected and evaluated cars daily "
good,Working for an agent has it's pros and cons. Pro you learn about life necessities for your own being and cons very demanding job and no benefits and low wages for the ammount of work being done.
good,"I was an insurance salesman.  It was pretty decent except starting out on a commission based pay was really hard to do.  I learned I was not a great salesman and after a few months I took on another job to pay my bills, eventually leaving farmers for yet another position that was hourly pay vs the commission."
good,"Good job, pays well. However, the job is very demanding and can make you worn out. You talk to contractors and customers to settle their claims and delivery a good customer service experience."
good,"Farmers as a whole was a good company to work with. I personally was employed by an agent of farmers, and was required to obtain my insurance licensing in order to serve the customers. Farmers itself does not decide on wage, hours, or benefits for my position, but rather the agent runs a small business. And being a small business, the agent can only afford minimum wage with no benefits package"
good,"As the owner of the local office, I learned a great deal in the business world.  The most enjoyable part of my time as owner of a local Farmers Insurance Agency was building a strong professional network in my community."
good,Good company with a great mission from the top down. Employee friendly and opportunities to learn several different skill sets in the insurance claims industry.
good,"Great company to work for if you're at a district managers location. The compensation could be improved upon but, like most sales positions, it depends on your sales."
good,Farmers insurance is a great company to work for. Many opportunities are offer that help learn interact with different departments and see what other career opportunities are available.
good,"Great management, listens to suggestions and ideas of business growth. Flexible schedule with college classes currently attending.  Enjoy getting to know the community and interact with customers all day with their insurance needs."
good,Great products. Poor lack of training. Driving distance was too far. Commission pay wasn't worth it. Appreciate being introduced to the insurance business.
good,"sell insurance to prospective clients 8 hours a day"
good,Offers various learning tools through online course. Encourages each employee to learn more about products they offer through online. Provide quick online support.
good,My time spent working here was very encouraging. The continuous chance to learn was beneficial in my role. Management was always a positive influence and confidence booster for everyone on their team. Advancement was made available in house before positions were posted publicly.
good,Decent place to work but middle TN management is terrible. I really like the company car and the flexibility. I also like being able to travel outside of my territory to help out.
good,I have been with this company for over 12 years. I have loved my 12yrs but I am ready to improve myself and experience new challenges. I live in an area where advancement isn't happening. I recommend the company.
good,productive environment and well trained staff to teach you the ropes. Very family friendly place to work at. I learned that in order to sell on value which is a must with big insurance companies you must know your product and not be afraid to close the sell.
good,"To be honest I dont think there was a very hard part of my job. I pretty much enjoyed every aspect of the work."
good,"I would recommend Farmers Insurance as a workplace but am in need of competitive pay and benefits. I do, however, enjoy assisting our clients and representing our agency in a professional manner."
good,"Worked for Farmers for over 5 years, while my experience overall was stressful I enjoyed working there. However, management is constantly being reorganized which makes it difficult to constantly have to transition within new management."
good,"Typically, volunteering at a local office is just answering phones and communicating information. Occassionally, you have to deal with some angry people, but as this particular Farmer's is such a small start-up business, it was a slow paced work experience. It was nice to be able to get that experience talking with people."
good,fun environment where its fast past need to be on top of all the work where you need to make sure to meet the goals that are set up as well as sell sell sell
good,Overall good experience good people they are always head of the game always on time with pay always good with your paperwork never no hassles or complaints
good,"Market is too competitve to build a book of business where you can profitable run an agency.  However, Farmer's is a great company to work for.  It would take years to build a profitable book of business"
good,Had a nice work culture and was improving and various aspects.Company is willing to adopt to changes and impart industry standards. Need to do good work with planning.
good,"I enjoyed working with Farmers Insurance.  My boss was truly amazing.  I would have probably stayed working there, however I did not see myself selling auto insurance in the future."
good,"Farmers Insurance has recently invested heavily in new technologies and employee training to improve the customer experience.  Aspirations for achievement of that goal are high, but the reality of organizational effectiveness and sponsorship for leveraging those investments hasn't caught up yet.  Investment in leadership effectiveness lags further behind, and accountability for leadership integrity and performance is low.  There are a lot of great people at Farmers Insurance, who care very much about their customers and the performance of the business.  Overall, the company demonstrates genuine investment in the financial security of its customers.  Farmers Insurance has a long history of success, so I expect they will make progress towards their aspirations for even better customer service as time goes on."
good,"insurance is not for everyone but if you have an interest in the field, Farmers is a good company to work for. advancement opportunities, ongoing education"
good,"Great Coworkers, heavy workload that can become unmanageable. "
good,"After working under the Farmers brand for over 15 years I can honestly say that it allowed me to learn so much more about the Insurance industry than I had know prior to coming on board.  The over all ability to gain the knowledge that was used to make the agents that I worked with, better business owners.  The passion I have for Insurance was only enhanced during my time with Farmers."
good,nice Managers to work with. Nice pay. WE can learn a lot in this company. Good product overall. It's growing company and have very good reputation overall.
good,"The environment is very relaxed and slow paced, but there is much to do and the supervisors are really laid but can also challenge you to do more in the business and give you opportunities to expand on your skills."
good,"Auto and home insurance company in the USA                             "
good,Learned the insurance business hard worked long hours Great company to get your feet wet in the industry .................................................
good,"Great company to work for. Farmers really seems to care about its employees, and the individuals that have insurance policy with them. "
good,"Their career path was well-defined up to a certain point. Then, you had to know someone to get promoted. Good benefits, Pay was fair; time off was generous; health insurance was so-so - High premiums, sub par coverage."
good,"70+ hours weekly, great support tech-wise, but no real lead generating help. Burned myself. "
good,It was a fair mangable job. It was nice and quiet workplace. I would answer calls direct them to their agent. I would update the old files by putting them in our system. I helped any walk in or phone calls who wanted to make an appointment.
good,The whole office was very quiet similar to a library. My coworkers were mostly older women who did not like loud noises. So whenever I would speak they would look at me funny.
good,"Helping new customers find the best insurance possible, answering questions about they're insurance and also knowing that unfortunately  they get in car accidents but we are the ones that will make it all better by covering any injuries or they're vehicle damages."
good,This was a great place ot obtain the insurance knowledge I needed. I was able to obtain my Life and health insurance license by working at Farmer insurance
good,The only thing I can say about working at Farmers insurance is that if you were a high performing adjuster they would work with you on the possibility to work from home.
good,overall farmers was a great place to work.  my manager specifically made my job rough though and HR failed to help therefore I was intimidated and quit even though I wanted long term employment.
good,"The company tries to have a good culture but some of their managers are not on the same page.  If you are extroverted and outspoken you will do well, if not, you will get stuck and fast.  Benefits were good."
good,Good sales position for those who enjoy fast paced work. Can be stressful and commissions have been decreasing over the years but there is still great money to be made.
good,Farmers Insurance is a national company that is very fast paced and constantly changing. The people at the Caledonia location are great people to work with which creates a great workplace culture. Working with the people was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,Balanced work schedule. Family oriented. Easy to work around personal situations. Gained a lot of knowledge and experience that will be beneficial anywhere in the work force.
good,"We work from home, so when it is slow it is difficult to find things to work on. I like to be challenged and I am no longer challenged. In the office, they have comfort rooms, couches, ping pong table, arcade games, food days."
good,I worked with a lot of great people over the many years I worked there and had my position get moved to other states more than 3 times and was not willing to relocate.
good,My job here was pleasant although it was only temporary due to the long travel to the job & no advancement in office . I did learn great things as an assistant in the insurance field
good,Company is on the up and understands insurance very well. No benefits because all agencies are individually contracted. They have some of the best training in the country that prepares you to be successful.
good,Farmers Insurance is a great company but the agent I work for is not very active. I'm pretty much left on my own to generate sales and plan my work schedule.
good,It is nice to work & lot to learn about annuities & retirement work part. learned about enrollment. Workplace culture looks good & enjoyable to work..
good,not even controlled chaos>>> high school drama was too much 4 me. I was very good at producing numbers for the company but if i was confused about the facts of the product their was far too little educating sales meetings verses just make something up in the moment and hope it works for now.
good,Prospecting for appointments and sales. Getting referrals form current clients and customers service. The most enjoyable part of this job is selling a policy to a client to make sure they are taken care of.
good,Great experience and place to work right out of college. Learned a lot about providing customer service to agents and insured's. Would recommend this position to recent graduates.
good,"Management was outstanding and training was provided to employee's. Learned how to manage, train and run a daily office in the insurance industry and help other agents exceed in building their own agencies, and seeing them go on to advancements with the company."
good,Stable company with medical benefits.  Appears to attempt to maintain a balance between work and home.  Some opportunities to transfer within the company and to advance.
good,Farmers Insurance has great training tools! They provide great resources to become familiar with their insurance products. They strive on customer service for success.
good,"A typical day at this company would consist of being in the office alone for most of the day. If you needed help from the manager, then you would have to wait until they were in the office. The work was a slow but steady place and it included quoting, and renewing policies."
good,"	Provide insurance quotes to potential clients"
good,"it was a very fast paced environment "
good,"I ran the office at Farmers Insurance. My boss was kind. I had to learn the entire system by myself since he was not around a lot to teach me how to do it. I did enjoy running the office, though."
good,"On a daily basis, I felt as though I was able to actually help the customers. I learned about home and auto insurance. My agent that I worked for was helpful and always willing to teach and guide me. The culture was professional but fun. The hardest part of this job was having to turn away potential customers if they were deemed a risk to insure."
good,The pay is low and there are no health benefits.  Time off and holidays are decided by each individual agent.  Can be stressful usually around pay days when everyone wants to make changes to their policies and make payments.  You have to deal with a lot of negative people.  Good way to see if insurance is for you.
good,"A typical day at work involves answering phone calls, talking with clients, taking payments, and underwriting policies. Working with a 52-year agent, you learn something new everyday. My employer is a small business owner and it's just been the two of us running this office the past couple years. I handle the front of the office, answering phone calls, talking with clients, gathering information, and underwriting personal lines policies."
good,"great environment to work in, friendly atmosphere, fast paced, timely manner, easy going, very helpful people, great managers, huge opportunities to grow"
good,"The Farmers Insurance Group of Companies was built to last, with a firm foundation of reliable businesses and a dedication to continual improvement. What began as a simple Car insurance company for farmers has become a multi-line, multi-company insurer and financial services group with a solid reputation for doing the right thing for the right reason."
good,At Farmers insurance the goal was to provide a memorable customer experience in which was instilled in each employee. The atmosphere of the job as well was great.
good,Great opportunity to be your own boss and develop your own book of business and set your own schedule. You simply must show up and want to succeed at your work but it can be done.
good,"The company started out as a good company to work for.  Great concept of family, working to make sure the employee has a great experience.  As I got into the job it was harder to make the job work to be a good balance between home and work life.  As well as the moving to a new department being harder to attain also."
good,Good benefits with flexible scheduling. Ability to job shadow other positions and work closely with people in other departments. Good opportunities to volunteer and mentor other works.
good,FIG nation is an established company that is deeply rooted in North America. I was able to increase my professional network and learned alot about Leadership through this company.
good,"learned cold calling "
good,I worked part-time at this job for two years and 1 month. I was the customer service representative at Farmers Insurance. I was in charge of helping customers with their insurance policies with questions and when they had to pay their premium. I also learn about sales and about life insurance and business
good,There is a nice and laid back atmosphere. The work not hard and stressful. They also have one of the best cafetieres that I have eaten at in a work place.
good,Good company to work for.  A lot of changes that one needed to have the skill to be adaptable for those changes.  Friendly and Family orientated environment.  Work on a daily basis was the same unless there was a big change in the company for re-vamping what was assigned to employees.  People you work with are like family.  The hardest part of this job has been the fact they are closing this facility to down-size and be more centralized.  Moving was not an option for me.   The most enjoyable was to look at this job as a career and have strong work ethics to stay with the company for a long period of time.
good,"Great place to work if you are self-motivated."
good,I made a lot of friends at Farmers. They provide paid training and everyone seems genuinely happy to be there. There was no hard part about my job. I liked it a lot.
good,"Some good days, some bad days. Not ideal working schedule for person with children/family; unless you are higher management.  Great start to career, allows for young adults to build their resume.  Benefits are not the best, health insurance isn't anything to brag about these days any how."
good,"Fast paced, very detailed must pay attention to dates in order to keep policies current . Must contact insured, banks and make verifications . Something to do at all times ."
good,Very busy so work life balance is bad. Coworkers are very good. Time management is hardest part of the job. Coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Can be hectic at times, but what job isn't? Love being able to help all the customers, and the  hours are awesome I love having Saturday's off!! All time favorite job"
good,"My time with this organization was intensely in view of hitting a set number of dials every day and was supervised by a remarkably troublesome administrator who is no more with the organization, yet was the impetus for myself and numerous others to look for livelihood somewhere else. "
good,The supervisors are very help full along with your co workers. Every day is a new learning experience. Some days could be very challenge.
good,it's a call center job. good mix of calls coming in from agents and customers. good place to get experience in insurance. opportunities for advancement
good,Love my job and I would like Ike to continue in the company but advancing has been kind of challenging. Good pay and benefits and opportunities to relocqte
good,"The job was easy in terms of work, the management was a little subpar, however. Not really a hands on place to work. Telemarketing in general can be mentally exhausting."
good,It was a great job and I loved it. I would probably still be working there today but the agent left the insurance business.
good,"This job I'd have to say had it's moments. I started out as a temp and was told I was going to be a temp for no more than 90 days, well that temp position turned into being one for two years before I was hired on full time. I stayed with the company for three years before I moved states because I was good at what I did and did have a good supervisor I could count on."
good,"The people are the best aspect of the job and company. The insurance industry can be challenging at times, but Farmers is a great place to work. Supervisors and upper management are involved and accessible."
good,"Having Good Experience in work and challenging."
good,"This position has given me the knowledge of how insurance works and the satisfaction of passing that on. Owner is a great man, very supportive and a wonderful teacher. The hardest part of this job is the ups and downs of business as the  economy changes."
good,"Farmers is a fun, interesting and challenging place. Its a good place where you make life long friends. Good system, great technologies and fun people."
good,"Work is very routine, uneventful most days. Very structured and friendly environment. Learned lots about insurance coverage and premiums."
good,"Most enjoyable was working with attorneys and with many court clerks in different county's. Always learning something new in the legal system and with many new law changes"
good,working with wipro  at client location is a a good experience. Learned new things and worked on Insurance module that I never worked before. Manager is friendly and appreciates the work that is done properly. Functional team is helpful and good to work with
good,A typical day at work is helping between 20-30 customers an hour. The work pace is very busy your use your empathy skill daily. I work an co-manage yourself . My co-workers are awesome to work with. We work in an environment where everyone helps each other if needed. The hardest part of the job is those rare circumstances where you are unable to help a customer like they would like for you to. I enjoy helping people.
good,"The people I have encountered at Farmers are hardworking, honest and take pride in their work.  They are a young, energetic, fun group of people and many are in the early stages of their career."
good,"I would do anything in the office. From taking calls, folding letters to be delivered, driving to take pictures of newly insured houses, and any type customer service that was needed."
good,This is a good solid company that provides great benefits including above average vacation time and 401K matching.  The compensation for most jobs is average to a little below average but they do pay overtime for most positions that are not management.  The bonus structure is good but the raises are minimal at best.
good,"In a typical day of work, i would answer telephone inquiries, as well as process payments over the phone and help customers with questions regarding their policies. I learned how to call/communicate with different banks/escrow companies regarding mutual clients. The co workers there were ok for the most part, every one did their job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult clients, an the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people obtain their auto or home policies."
good,Great company that cares for it's employees and ensures they are both happy and well compensated. Challenging but worth it.
good,This was a contracted position and the work was very high tempo. A typical day was fool of hard work but the upper management was good and kept us busy with work.
good,"I literally started from the very bottom, and Farmers wanted to make the most of my time with them. Their a truly loving and supporting Company that wants nothing but to see their employees happy and new Family members (customers) completely covered."
good,"The work is rewarding, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Moving to a call center.  Multiple things to be learned, and every day is different."
good,"Great place to work with amazing benefits, but not single mom friendly."
good,Fast paced and energetic atmosphere. I learned about car insurance and customer service. Management was firm but kind. Co-workers helpful and personable. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help some customers because of Farmers policies. The most enjoyable part was that it was a fun carefree office and I loved the interaction with our clients.
good,"Farmers/Bristol West Has great benefits, tuition reimbursement, 401k, health, dental etc.  They have poor management and they come across as you only being a number. Its not a comfortable work environment. No morale. Within the job itself you do get the opportunity to own your call and make decisions. Co-workers are great as well. They want you to be almost robot like and its impossible to do so. They watch your numbers, call time, call intake, aux usage, hold time etc. Micro management at its finest. They do have fun activities to try and guild morale, it works for some."
good,A place where you can learn and grow your career. Opportunities to travel and meet new people.

I have learned to be patient with customers, and have learned responsibilities within an office environment. My co-workers are easy to work and get along with. The most challenging part of this job was the transition into an office, I feel I have came a long way from my first day and feel I can accomplish anything that may be required of me."

Helping the customer involved listening to the customer, and filing an insurance claim if need be, anwering their basic questions, or just getting them to the appropriate person to help them further process their claim. I learned every system they would let me have access to. I learned what would be needed in those systems every day, and what might be helpful in those once in awhile calls that would help me to help the customer without throwing them into the transfer circle.

good,A typical day of work was calling customers to schedule their Farmer's Friendly Review. I wrote down the results of the call in the computer. I applied discounts and found opportunities to lower the price of insurance if possible.
good,"Farmers is a great company overall. Salary, benefits, and compensation are determined by the agent you work for. The environment will vary based on the particular office / location."
good,A day at work was slow yet i understood my tasks and they never changed which was good as made me a reliable employee. I was given reasonable hours and during busy periods an abundance of possible hours.
good,They were impressed by my performance alone in how well I was able to recoup my losses from last quarter and come out ahead. By being a contractor you must always stay engaged with what’s happening in the demographic that you are targeting.
good,"Be READY to Invest time, money, and lack of sleep, if you want to be successful in selling Insurance, You get paid commission on sales you make so be prepared to find your own leads."
good,"Good work life balance.  The company is generous with PTO, actively seeks feedback on work life balance and accommodates their employees with balancing work and family needs"
good,"Farmers is a good company with a very strange culture.  If you ""buy in"" wholeheartedly then you can have a great time.  In addition to doing well in the job, there seems to be a requirement to be ""one of us."""
good,"I never know from week to week when I will be called in,  It is a one person office and I usually only get called in when the agent has to be out of the office for something,  And I would like a more steady job,  Two or three days a week,"
good,"A typical day at work is answering calls and posting premium payments.  I've learned about flood, home, auto, wind, and umbrella policies.  The most enjoyable part of this position is meeting clients and working with a great team."
good,"Over all good company to work for nice co-workers and a well balance company."
good,Very political place. It's great to gain experience but not the place you can build a career unless you hit it off with a good upper level manager. Management styles vary and usually only the yes men get promoted.
good,"Typical day at Farmers includes checking and responding to emails. Looking for any new documents that have arrived overnight. Catching up on phone calls to insureds and claimants. Reviewing you new claims for the day. Making first contact on your new claims. Making new appointments for inspections or meetings with claimants. I learned a tremendous amount about the insurance industry obviously more so on claims. The training you receive from Farmers is first class. The hardest part of the job is negotiating settlements and scoping out more complex claims due to the property that was damaged or the type of damage. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast paced environment, the ability to plan out your own day and to work from home. The company vehicle was also very convenient."
good,"Employee engagement "
good,agent did not pay enough and he did not want to pay for license cost. I was studying and never got scheduled for test. After a few months he said i had to pay for it.
good,"Pressured to sell policies. Not well enough trained.however, training is beginning to be more important. I don’t feel well trained to do my job as expected."
good,"Farmers compensates generously because the job sucks. Dealing with people who have just gotten into an accident, survived a natural disaster, found damage in their homes, etc. is incredibly stressful. Most of the time people were angry because the adjuster never called them back. As a CSA, there is literally nothing you can do to help anyone except refer them to someone else. Generally, that someone else was not available. Insurance is a scam. The company is in it for the money, not to be helpful. If you have a conscience, this employer is not for you."
good,the job has a good culture and good benefits.it's a good place to work if you like the job tasks.I found it moving up in the company however was very hard to do.
good,"My employment with Farmers has been great from the beginning until present.  The work culture is very laid back and family oriented.  Everyone works together as a team to meet performance goals and continue grow together.  The job is very demanding, high paced, and can be very stressful on a day to day basis.  I have a lot of responsibilities to my insured's, my team, and my leadership staff.  The work/life balance is not as good as I hoped it would be but the compensation is very high comparatively which somewhat offsets each other."
good,I was here for a good while learned a lot of things. Unfortunately being in my role i was not given the opportunity to advance by taking on some training classes. I was expected to only get quotes/sales.
good,Good company to work for. I loved all of my co-workers. They offer good benefits. The managers are lacking and provide very lil communication. Most positions are in the call center. The insurance industry is very pace and interesting.
good,Company promotes family atmosphere.  Great place to work.  Job opportunities if you are willing to relocate.  I had the opportunity to work with lots of different areas of the company and was able to learn a lot.
good,"Was a great company to work for, but very understaffed for the amount of claims volume they handled.  Pay was not up to speed with what other companies were paying at the time, but that was many years ago."
good,Answering phone calls. Performed daily payment audits.  Ability to build rapport with clients and new prospects. Called warm leads a week to build client base.
good,"Management was proactive in keeping the employees informed of new company programs and developments, however I think their compensation lagged a little behind the prevailing compensation for competing companies."
good,"The first position worked at Farmers was very fast paced and it was difficult to keep up with the needs of the position. The team was good and willing to assist when time allowed."
good,"I learned alot of things on a daily simply because I was taking calls from all the US and every state has their own different rules and requirements. They had a thing called profit sharing and basically it narrowed down to a really big bonus for everyone,"
good,"Farmers Insurance, while it is a fast-paced environment to work in there, is also promoting a family-friendly environment.  At farmers, you will work on various auto and homes claims for personal line and commercial lines insurance."
good,It’s a busy and calm place to work at. Our customers feel relieved knowing that they are being taken care of regardless what type of insurance they have.
good,It was okay working there. I did not really like insurance and still don't. I wouldn't recommend working in insurance unless you like a fast paced and stressful work environment.
good,"Call centers, as a rule, are stressful and fast-paced, focusing on performance metrics and placing a lot of responsibility on their call-center employees.  However, Farmers is not just a claim center.  It is an often-discovered, open secret that being a CSA in the call center is not for everyone, and that performing well is intended to help you advance should that be the case."
good,"After getting all the necessary licenses, you have to get to the quota referred to a 40 & 4.  This means before you are able to be paid full commission and be eligible to have own office and assistants/employees you have to sell 40 policies with 4 of them being a cross-sell (any policy combined with life insurance up-sale) The toughest part of the job, by far, is the hours and amount of work it takes to get to your 40 & 4.  Best part about job is that after you meet these specific requirements, the compensation is great and you make your own hours."
good,"Great atmosphere at work, but work on purely commission basis without any benefits.  Very hard to earn enough to help with family finances.  The upside is that we came come and go as we please and take any days off that we like."
good,I did not enjoy the sales environment.  Agent /Owner was professional and considerate of employees.  Agency was a start-up.  Difficult to obtain leads that were productive.
good,"Busy and stressful working conditions. Definitely not made for everyone. Anytime you are dealing with people and money, tense situations will occur. You have to have people skills."
good,"Secretarial work, deal with walk-in customers and over the phone, entering information in the PC and take payments from customers. It was a nice atmosphere to work at"
good,Farmers is a great environment. Job placement is poor especiallly considering qualifications and stacking up to people in higher positions with similar or lesser resumes.
good,"Great place to work to constantly keep you learning. There is very little down time and at the end of the day, you feel like you really did something with the day."
good,"Farmers Insurance Group has a lot of potential as a quality employer.  Satisfactory benefits and lots of opportunities abound.  Significant growth within the company does come with the high likelihood of a relocation to a regional operations center, usually in the Midwest or California."
good,I sold car and home insurance.  I made calls for surveys.  I dropped off door hangers.  I did some call calling to solicit business.  I trained with the Director on insurance products.
good,"My job is to create lead list for myself and another employee so that we may call and review their current insurance coverage. I am able to keep a professional and well established relationship with our customers new, former and current. I enjoy when we are able to help the customer and satisfy all their insurance needs."
good,"Typical office environment, get ready to talk to people about how little they know about insurance. Stressful atmosphere at times. Have to pay and find time to study to receive your property and casualty test."
good,Great patient and appreciative customers in Finance Department where there has been a stable and successful management. Unfortunately on the IT side there is a very confusing restructuring where in pockets of areas including my area new non technical management with no process or technical understanding was put in place causing a lot of confusion and chaos.
good,"This is a very fast paced job, working on computer terminal. You will be taking in and out bound calls, dealing with multiple customers on a daily basis."
good,Must be a self motivator to make a living selling insurance.  You must be willing to sacrifice your family time until you start making a living.  You must be bold.
good,I loved my job.  I handled all of the claims made against a very large medical institution in San Francisco.  It was exciting and interesting.  The department was closed within 1 year 2 months of me being hired.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.
good,"I don't spend time at the office, but the environment there was great, the team is very supportive and understanding of any issues that may have occurred with any concerned that I might have."
good,Manager/Owner takes the time to make sure you are well trained for the job. Great place to start if you are new to the insurance industry. Owner provides plenty of leads to generate business.
good,It is a decent company no real complaints besides the medical benefits.  The company offers flex schedules and a collaborative work environment. Management are receptive for the most part to ideas.
good,Wish to grow in other areas of HR. I really enjoy working with the people. Our HR dept. is constantly changing due to lack of consistency in processes. We are working on streamlining our processses
good,Great opportunity for the right person.  Work/Life balance is challenging environment.  The people are the best thing about this company.  A lot of agent have been in the industry for 30+ years.
good,"A very nice place to work for at Farmer's insurance ."
good,Mature corporate environment. Little social engagement between employees. No communication with upper management. Great office environment. A good work culture to be a part of.
good,"answered hones"
good,"Typical 8-5 corporate position with strong emphasis on sales and customer service.  Clients can be difficult.  Somewhat stressful, as people are not always happy to deal with insurance.  Small office environment."
good,"Just your typical claims job!  However, they do have an awesome benefits package and the people there are awesome. Farmers is all about networking and who you know in order to be considered for another job."
good,"I enjoyed to going to work for this company as I knew they would always be there for me and my family. They are very supportive of time with my kids when necessary. And time to refresh, when needed."
good,"While I was very happy with the time I spent at Farmers, there was too much senior management left undisclosed to those of us on the front line. Although I would gladly still work there if not for the layoffs, I would prefer a company with more transparency."
good,"It was a customer service call center that was very going.  You came in the morning and put your headset on and took calls, till break, lunch and then go home."
good,"I loved being able to help people and I had a great bunch of people to work with. However, the benefits were not good, the pay was not near what someone in my position should have been paid, and there were no opportunities for advancement without a bachelors degree."
good,"You have your own desk and computer assigned to you instead of the way some call centers that give you a new desk area every shift. They provide plenty of resources to get the information you need about your job duties, benefits, and procedures."
good,"As a Hadoop Developer and admin,Learnt advance topics on Haddop."
good,The atmosphere and overall environment of this workplace was good and made me want to go to work. The agent and fellow associates were very professional and allowed me to develop my professional skills.
good,"Typical call center environment"
good,"i learned different aspects of insurance."

good,"Meet and great customers and retail a fantastic product line. I had to work to daily, weekly and ,monthly sales targets and complete paperwork for the company. I really enjoyed the appointment based position. Helping people achieve the looks they desired was very rewarding."
good,"What I liked about this job was the lack of structure, you are able to schedule you days and I was able to develop communication skills the I would not have been able to do in most other situations"
good,"Love the job and being able to help and teach our customers what insurance is really about so they can make well informed coverage decisions. Being a problem solver is a must and at the end of the day, when you've helped someone you really get a rush. There's always something new to learn and you'll never encounter the same situation twice!"
good,"I have been working as an Office Assistant at Farmer's Insurance and I really love working there. I would come to work about 30 minutes early everyday and wait for my supervisor to open the door. On a typical day, when I get a lot of phone calls from clients regarding their polices or claims. I tend to fall behind on filing, since there is always forms to be file. But I've learned to manage that with transferring some calls to my co workers. I've learned so much about the company and its products. As an Office Assistant, my duty is to do basic general office work. Having to work together is a way to learn from one another. Also accomplish our goal or meet deadlines."
good,"I have been with Farmers for 8 years, at first it was just a job but as time went on I found that I love the insurance industry. I work with 2 others in my office. My boss has definitely helped me grow and achieve more than I thought I could. The only hard part of the job is beating rates, other than that it is great and easy. I enjoy talking with clients and helping them understand the insurance process and how things work."
good,"I learned how to be assertive and confident with clients, whether it was over the phone or in person. It was great exposure to the real-world workforce; there was a variety of clients, and my job had me doing a variety of tasks, so working there gave me a taste of a little bit of everything. My co-workers were great, and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with clients who are past due on payments, especially when it's because of family hardships or financial difficulties, but this job helped me  learn to navigate through those scenarios more wisely."
good,"Farmers is a good company, but it depends on the agency that you work for as to what your work environment is like."
good,Over all it's good company. i learned lot of new technical skills.
good,"A typical work day was 15 + claims a day. I learned a lot about the insurance industry working claims across the United States. Management was good, but a different point of view from all different managers. Coworkers were very easy to get along with and I enjoyed the vast majority of them. The hardest part of this job was the claims volume and the most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers and supervisor."
good,"*Communication is key"
good,It was fun I loved working for my boss but you had to become an insurance agent to work there and I just wanted to be a receptionist.
good,"enjoyed what i did in that short period.open mail,answer phones..etc."
good,I like the people around me. I do appreciate the positive atmosphere.
good,"- Good work/life balance"
good,"Recent changes in emphasis on Employee focus. As an increase in scope and responsibility is achieved, there is less micro management and more autonomy in the work place.  Many positions are virtual or partial virtual in nature and the company has a major focus on technology"
good,"Source candidates - 30-40/day"
good,Quiet place to work everyone really kept to themselves. Really not much to say never really talked alot I came in completed my work left at lunch time for lunch completed more work and clocked out of work at my off time
good,"They a very goal oriented. They made the workplace a fun place to work. But when someone was loosing their job, didn't help the person to find another job within the company. In fact, management didn't seem to really care. Co-workers were good to work with because they were friendly and helpful to everyone."
good,"I loved the culture there. Many of my best friends were made at that company. However, the management style is very agressive and there is a lot of pressure put on their employees to perform."

good,"• Maintain and build rapport with new and existing clients, from individuals to corporations."
good,Answers calls
good,"Productive workplace. Very high paced, high demand, and high stress. Workplace is always changing and you must be able to deal and adapt to changes very quickly. Very good people to work with."
good,A chance get a cup of coffee and review the tasks for the day. Management is not micro and my co-workers are team players on the job and outside of the workplace. All of the above would be the most enjoyable parts of any position I would occupy.
good,"Fast paced Call Center environment. Wired to headphones at all times. Receiving calls of people from any state where the company offers insurance, looking for new quotes. Generate the quote, write the policy and close the sale. All employees work independently, but when the time allows, we used to help each other."
good,".As long as you work hard,  you're rewarded. Lots of grunt work, but once the ball gets rolling, the return is pretty good. Must have a good attitude."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Farmers. My direct supervisors were always kind, and I could always go to them with any questions or concerns. I enjoyed the people I worked alongside. I loved the fact that we didn't work weekends, and had all the holidays off. Great family-work balance."
good,Calls come in very consistently. Everyone there is very friendly. They have good benefits. Can be stressful as the colors are usually going through difficult experiences
good,They are working their best to increase pay rates and decrease premium rates. hard to sell if rates keep going up. if you want to make a lot of sales try something easier for the first time.
good,"Great Company to work for. Lots of incentives and fun days. Decent pay, with promotion opportunities. Definitely need customer service, phone, and patience. Need problem solving skills."
good,"...and it came at just the right time.  They say they encourage free speech and to challenge the status quo, but if you do, beware the consequences if they don't like what you have to say - very much like our current political climate."
good,"They pay well including benefits, but they do work you hard. As with many companies, there were many times when it felt like management would not listen and work load would get overwhelming, but I do feel like they paid well to compensate."
good,"Good benefits. Always had good supervisors that were supportive. The people that I worked with were the best part. Generally, a positive environment. Good leadership overall."
good,You create the culture in your agency and are responsible for the daily operations top-to-bottom.  Corporate climate is cold and very disconnected from agency.  Somewhat out of touch.
good,"You're free to design your own career path at Farmers. There are opportunities for training and advancement as desired. And if you're open to relocation, there are options around the country."
good,good company to work for. compensation is adequate. standard work load. friendly environment. advancement easily to achieve if you're committed. good benefits.
good,"Built up an agency from scratch to over 1000 policies"
good,"Farmers taught me a lot about dealing with all types of people while also focusing on doing my job efficiently for my employer. The work environment was very fast paced and challenging, but I felt many times that I was just a number. Also, anagement focused too much on the negative aspects of performace and never addressed anything outside of the job."
good,worked in a small office with an insurance agent as my boss. It was a warm and comfortable work environment.  There was much to learn and a lot of customer interaction.
good,"Answer inbound calls from customers regarding existing claims or filing of new claims and utilize tools provided to assist customers in resolving issues.

good,"Excellent income and benefits, good opportunity for advancement, company is anxious to provide as much education and tools as needed to do a good job."
good,"Owner/operator of agency. Independent contractor, where Farmers products are offered.  You can make money here you want if willing to put time and years into your own agency. Frustrating as the vision of company seems very unclear in 2019 and beyond, and do not communicate this to distribution force well at all.  That all being said, its been an incredible opportunity to have spent last many years here."
good,"Farmers has created a good culture. After being at other carriers now, i can compare and miss what i had. The grass was greener there. Claims are still claims, but their way of engagement made it tolerable. The load there was also less than my new role."
good,I started my career with Farmers and appreciated the training that I rec'd. I enjoyed the autonomy and independence working in San Antonio and I had a great supervisor to work with. I have nothing else to comment on.
good,Ok.........................................i didnt mind working here. Loved my co workers and most of the supervisors were very helpful. Very good training for my license was included

good,Farmers insurance is a great place to work but my manager had poor management skills I have flexible hours to work around my school and my kids and had great benefits
good,"I learned the importance of applying good work ethics, ownership responsibility, and good customer service skills. Business management for me was a great learning experience which included; the importance to plan my daily and monthly goals, to coach and encourage my employees in a positive manner and to be a good example of motivation to them. The hardest part of my job as a Farmers agent was not having any type of benefits from the corporate, I had to pay for my own."
good,"Great place if you need a job. Work lots of hours and usually over time opportunities available. "
good,"Overall a good place to work. It just had the normal day to day dealings as with any job, some stress, but also a lot of good benefits that outweighed the negatives."
good,The  one thing I enjoyed  at Farmers I was working for different agents. That really set the tone for me and help my work ethics because everyone had something different to teach you.
good,"Good place to work for and very reasonable establishment.Always ready to answer any customer call and help with payments, questions, concerns. Help with claims."
good,There was very little change in the day to day routine.  It was very hard to be promoted as most of the operations were in Kansas CIty and Oklahoma City OK
good,"Farmers is one of the best place to work. i was there only one month , but was very happy at this job . My managers there where always friendly and i always knew i can ask for help if i had any issues with work ."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Farmers. Great place to work and great benefits. The company practices inclusion and gives back with great community service efforts. I do wish they had more diversity.
good,"Farmer's seems to be a great company to work for. I was hired on know the job would end in exactly a year. Not  long after that, I was told it was push up to 8-9 months left. Then the end date was pushed up again and I was recently made aware of having less than a month. I felt i was hired under false terms, but my short time with Farmer's has been great!"
good,"I worked yet again for myself. There is no direct boss but you have a company quota to meet. My insurance agent sponsor did maintain my checks and withheld my commissions when I left. Its hard to sell life insurance because people don't see it as a need, however car insurance is necessary. But then again you have those that don't pay and then you are debited your commissions form those policy's so it can be difficult and cut throat."
good,Good company to work for if you have never sold insurance before and are willing to learn. If you get in the right district you can really get the training you need to succeed.
good,A typical day at work would be to meet our sales quota by the end of each day and week. Also it would be to sign up client for policies and help assist them with the coverage on their existing policy.
good,"It was hands on the job kind of work."
good,A challenging and collaborative environment working with teams. There are many chances to earn annual bonuses and the district management is always friendly and obliging.
good,"Very busy job with lots to get done. This job will highly develop customer service skills, typing skills, collaborating, career-advancement and financial opportunities as well as benefits."
good,Most departments are good places to work. Most are collaborative and have room for advancement. Some departments tend to be catty and work on favortisim
good,Farmers was a wonderful place to work. Quick pace able to assist customers with car and home life insurance. I was able to help people on the worst days of there lives to make it better.
good,"I worked there almost 37 years in four different operations. It was an excellent customer service environment. Leadership always concerned about employee morale, benefits, opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed working at Farmers.  There were great people and benefits.  The management team was focused and caring.  I appreciated my time there, and wish that the commute would not have been so long."
good,Very flexible and understanding of my school schedule and still allowed me to get a good amount of hours. I enjoyed working here but I ended up moving so I had to quit.
good,I love the company but not the small agency owner pressure no benefits you pay your own taxes and no help for leads on new business you have to drum up your own.
good,this is fast pace job which requires you work more than 40 hours but due to labor cost they have cut overtime time which mean less time to do more work for not enough pay
good,"4 Farmers agents in a town of 35000. rates continued to increase on every renewal making client retention difficult at best. "
good,It's a good company. They should have been able to stay up to date with technology without have to lay people office.  The clerical staff are a vital part of a company.
good,"A typical day at work includes answering phones, responding to emails, and working with clients to understand what kind of insurance needs they have.  Most of the clients are great and I developed relationships with many of them.  Some of the expectations are not clear and standards occasionally change without notice."
good,Farmers is a good place for someone who is wanting to own their own company.  The major issue is being rate competitive in a saturated market.  Need to be a strong net worker in order to be successful.
good,This is a fast pace high demanding job working that requires decision making and organization.  The benefits are pretty good as well as the compensation.  They do expect you to perform above and beyond so keep that in mind.
good,"A typical day at work was always very busy. We helped customers with their insurance as well as filed claims and managed documentations. I really enjoyed working at an office and having my own desk. Even though there was always something to do, the pace of it was very nice."
good,"Farmers was a ok company to work for, i met a lot of awesome people in 5 years over there and I've learned a lot. I was traveling a lot for my job and i also wanted to start a family. So i had to give up my job to spend more time at home with my family."
good,I enjoyed the training and team spirit fostered by Farmers Insurance. I enjoyed having the freedom in my schedule to take care of things that I felt were very important. I would love the opportunity to be at a company that I can grow with.
good,Great opportunity for the right person and enjoy working with the people. Plenty of room for advancement. Must be detailed oriented and analytical. Each department has a different culture. Great benefits
good,"The employer was kind but not a good place if you""re looking for job security < you need to be able to have free time constantly and not much room to grow in your career"
good,They are always happy to see you at farmers insurance. Some of the clients can be a bit aggravating but as long as you keep calm and figure things out quickly then you will never have an unsatisfied customer
good,Easy-going. Adaptable. Easy-paced. Hands on use with computers and documents. Need good customer service skills and communication skills. Hours can be flexible.
good,"I loved working at Farmers Insurance and if I had family or someone I trusted to watch my kids for me during the day, without hesitation I would go back."
good,I worked 60 hours a week and even on weekends.  I would typically leave the house at 8am and get home at 8 or 9 at night 4 nights a week.  I was responsible for all aspects of the business and the results of the team.
good,It has good pay. They do micromanage you. They are very big with a lot of employees. They do offer good benefits and pay every two week. nice break rooms.
good,"Culture Change not positive, management directed to punitive  actions. Policies are ethical to claimants and coworkers look to each other for support."
good,Farmers has great opportunities for growth due to massive expansion.  Coworkers are great people.  Can be a little hard to get things done given bureaucratic restrictions.
good,"I enjoyed the fast-paced, competitive nature of the job. I feel however that I wasn't adequately trained in the job nor did I fully understand all the aspects of insurance."
good,Very detailed in typing different types of insurance policies as required by insurance companies and sale representatives of the company.   Need to be very accurate.
good,insurance is stressful and farmers tries to make each day less stressful but it can be hard with ever changing regulations and a much more stagnant corporate structure than they boast.
good,"High volume customer service call floor that teaches you how to be patient and adaptable to corporate change."
good,I have worked for 40 years at Farmers Insurance was displaced because of company moving out of Pocatello. Farmers Insurance was agreat company to work for.
good,"Strong sales orientated people.  However, management skills will need to improve to sustain growth.  Flexibility is an issue."
good,"The company touts itself as being very open and welcoming, and I do believe that they have a good overall culture at Farmer's, but it can also be very difficult to move up. They like to keep people in positions at least a year before they open up the opportunity for advancement. And although my supervisor, and mentor encouraged me to apply for other positions that I was qualified for, the hiring managers wouldn't give me the opportunity to interview because I hadn't been with the company long enough. "
good,"Good place to work for almost 4 years. Bottom line, 2 departments were outsourced to India with little for warning.  This was a rather devastating sequence of events."
good,"Enter new lawsuits in computer accurately, assign to appropriate legal team.  E-mail notice to Managing Attorney, Office Manager, Claim Adjuster and Claims Manager.  Send correspondence to client advising them of who is handling the matter for them and provide contact information.  Answer phones at reception desk, direct visitors, mail, archive files, file in for secretaries who at out of office, order office supplies."
good,Good management staff. All employees very helpful in all areas. Work hours were normal and the pay was decent. Good place to hone in marketing skills.
good,"company provides the ability to work from home, huge plus when you have kids."
good,"As an Insurance agent and sales person I listen effectively to my prospective clients needs before assisting them with the proper insurance policies. I sold auto, boat, home, rental, and life insurance. I also had experience selling annuities and mutual funds. To perform this line of work I needed to improve my communications skills to build trust to prospective clients, and rapport to existing clients to continue doing business with the company. That also included presentation skills about the products that best fitted their needs and made sure they understood each and every products before they made a decision."
good,"Developed marketing and sale plans to generate sale opportunities"
good,"I learned how to work with others and with customers. Some of my job requirements were to call the customers, offer them more plan benefits.  i learned to navigate thru the computer,  i even went out some days to hand out pamplets to people in the area to inform them of Farmers insurance rates"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of phone calls all day long, solving clients issues and making new insurance policies. I learned how to make insurance policies, how to solve clients issues. The management we had was usually out of the office approximately three out of the five days of the week, we would mostly see her during meetings. The workers where great they are always happy, never in a bad mood, ready to assist the clients. The hardest part of the job was selling life insurance. I enjoyed everything on the job, there was nothing that i dint enjoy."
good,"The ideology of Farmer's is very good for the customers they serve and for the employees. The job requirements are that of a typical insurance company, needing to recruit new clients, but Farmer's believes in being a personal assistant to the client, giving a family feel to the business."
good,"A fast-paced working environment where you are hands on in the claims process, assisting customer with obtaining documentation from body shops to get rental/repairs approved on their vehicle"
good,You learn so many new things about people. You learn how to schedule appointments and use a multilined telephone. I was able to work from home on my own schedule. The agent that I worked for would give me a list of names and numbers to call and try and get customers to buy our insurance.
good,Overall the job was ok. I don't really have any complaints other than I just didn't feel there was any room to advance in that particular agency. I was the personal lines specialist but really wanted to learn about commercial insurance. We had a commercial person so I was never able to dip my foot into that pool in that agency.
good,"I enjoyed learning and working under the Farmers Insurance name. All offices are run differently, but the companies fundamentals are wonderful. Day to day office duties are typical, management varies as well as co-workers. I enjoyed communicating with a variety of clients and helping them with all of their needs."
good,Family style atmosphere and a company that for the most part seems to genuinely care about employees.  Difficult industry however that is heavily regulated and has a saturated market.
good,"You are able to grow and develop if you meet your numbers/metrics. Great training, although it seemed sometimes that before you got comfortable on the floor they had you training again for something new."
good,I loved working for Farmers Insurance as an agent in the office and working with clients to upsell and guide them in their insurance buying process.
good,"Working at farmer's insurance was a great experience I learned a lot working in the insurance industry .I enjoyed my supervisor's as well as co-worker's . I love assisting client's , claimant's, and insured with any issues they have had,and making sure I was able to fully help."
good,"A average day at Farmers is opening the office, putting on the printer, and making sure ink levels are good.  I also printing out paper work of clients with missing documents- printing the document that needs to be signed and mailing them out to them. Then when the appropriate  documentation is signed scanning it in to farmers insurance network for it to be evaluated ."
good,"Was Claims Clerk and main Receptionist for this large insurance company.  I learned to take auto claims over phone, typed correspondence, learned to transcribe reports while answering phones and directed calls for this large insurance company.  Opened mail and distributed it.  learned allot about auto insurance.  Management was very strict.  Some co-workers could cause you a lot of grief.  Answering the phones was probably the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of job was lunch and company picnics."
good,"clocked in, went to my counter, seen what my goal was for the day, looked at sale paper to see what was going on for the day, put up any freight that was to put up, management wasn't always fair, co-workers were great, hardest part was getting customers to open credit applications, I enjoyed working with people"
good,"You are a licensed receptionist. You answer phone call, you work directly with customers/clients. You build personal connections with your clients."
good,"Quote and write policies, keep up with customers information and make payments for customers. Balance accounts receivable at the end of the day. It's a fast paced environment and changes have to be made in a timely matter."
good,I love working for Farmers Insurance. I just wished they had better structure and advancement opportunities.
good,"Great company to work for, lots of activity going on at Farmers Insurance.   Something is always going on and people are willing to step up and work for with you."
good,Management in PIP office was positive and enjoyable. Hours during my tenture was expandable.
good,"Boss/agent is an excellent supervisor and mentor. He provides you with all of the tools you need to grow within his agency, and much of what he teaches can be applied in daily life."
good,"Great team adviser, I perfected cold-calls and how to read customer needs. There were always new tips for service to go beyond need and make the customer/agent experience effortless."
good,"No 2 days are alike. If you want to go far with the company the following things are important"
good,My typical work day consists of collaboration and direct communication with hiring managers across the organization. Consistent collaboration with HR Business Partners and strategic communication on new staffing initiatives.
good,Worked at the district managers office was a cool place but very male dominant.
good,"I was very exited to take this job as I have several friends who also work here and they also enjoy it.  The benefits are good and my immediate manager really cares, even calling me at home when I'm sick just to check in with me.  The downside is the upper management.  Like any large company, they choose to implement changes that affect their workers without even bothering to ask their employees first.  Their is very little communication with the employees regarding changes, and when there is it comes after a change has been made so it makes little impact.  This is a company that has people that care, but they need to remember that while our customers are obviously vital to the business, running through employees constantly because they are unhappy is not the way to run a business."
good,"Nice company to work for, they give you opportunities to grow."
good,A typical day at work starts with call after call coming in. You have to be ready to assist every call giving each customer the attention they deserve as if they are the only call you have that day. I have learned you need to show empathy and compassion when it is needed. Also predicting their needs before they even have to tell you. The relationship with both management and your co-workers is very important. You need to feel as if you all are working on the same team. The hardest part of the job would be that sometimes you can not always give someone what they want. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers and make sure they are satisfied with the service that they receive.
good,"Great company to work for, great training and fantastic staff to work with"
good,"A typical day at work was mostly busy during the week. On Saturday's it was a lot more calm, and less traffic in the office. I learned how to send faxes, speak with customers, and solve problems. My co-workers were great, they helped me out a lot. We supported each other through difficult tasks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who just got into car accidents or just had things stolen because of the state they were in. Most of them were shaken up and shocked, so it was a little difficult to calm them down. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy people were when they got their insurance and got an affordable premium. Or when people had a problem and we could help them solve it. That was extremely rewarding."
good,I have worked in sales for years but found with the increasing rates (4 within the last year) the company goals are currently unrealistic.  Wish I could stay with the company but as an agent it is not financially reasonable.
good,"Telemarketing services. Assisted future clients with information about company and services offered. Answered telephones and scheduled appointments. Filed important documents, billed clients. Ran any errands needed. Most enjoyable part was the flexible hours and agent I worked for was very professional."
good,Great training program.  All the tools needed to succeed are there for the taking.  You must be a true entrepreneur at heart to appreciate the work and tolerate the long hours.  The reward will come.
good,"Open the doors, set the environment to a pleasing place to do business.  Have computers and equipment working.  Systems set up and in place to run smooth.  Greet customers and potential customers with a friendly helpful attitude.  Meet as many of the customers needs as they allow.  Take continuing education as often as possible to be a value to the team.  Communicate with home office and customer care.  Most enjoyable part of the job is stamping and processing paperwork.  Hardest part of the job is filtering attitude from other people and not allowing it to wreck my day.  Co workers are a must and it seems to have accomplished a very necessary part of the office function, but it can be taxing trying to keep them happy and motivated."
good,"was a small office but busy, enjoyed working for the agent and his wife.  the hours and convenience was a plus"
good,Farmers is a good company with a good product selection. It is ideal for the single or married person with no kids. 
good,"Work at the Service center consist of signing in to system each day and signing in and out for all breaks and lunch. system recorded productuion with random processed calls and transactions auditied for compliance and accuracy. Micromangement was most difficult part of job, however great feed back. The greatest part is working with coworkers and developing solid relationships and support."
good,"Processing of all daily and weekly insurance applications for Home and Auto Insurance, surety bonds, customer relations, inspections of vehicles, claim processing and collecting funds from customers."
good,"I would file claims, get quotes for customers. It was a really fun learning job. The hardest part of the job was it got hectic or when we were short staff."
good,"Heavy work-load and raises are difficult to come by. However, my co-workers were great and there were several solid members of management. It's very corporate America, but if you don't mind that, it's a good place."
good,"Building and managing my own agency. Start from zero in sales, management, and growth."
good,"Farmers Insurance has grown exponentially since I joined the company in 2005. They have expanded their product lines, aquired talent from outside the company to cultivate a more diversified approach to doing business and achieved a widely recognizable and respected brand within the industry. I have had several opportunies to expand my professional skill set by working with our agents, both within the Commercial operations team and outside in the field in a marketing capacity, I thoroughly enjoy working in the field with the agents, supporting their efforts to grow their Commercial book of business through product and marketing training."
good,"Report elaborated for Goal verification, chalenges to get a better survey every month."
good,"I work 9-5 Monday through Friday. I have learned a lot about the laws and regulations of insurance, and how to service our clients policies efficiently.My manager is a great person, and really helps explain any questions. It is just me, and the agent in the office."
good,"After starting there, I got an opportunity to be trained and obtain Scrum Master certificate.  I then got the opportunity to become Scrum Master and obtain more experience."
good,Farmers was a good company. There was job security for the most part and you were recognized for a job well done. The compensation was very competitive.
good,I don't think this review will help anyone know more about Farmers because I worked for an independent owner. The company itself really wasn't part of my employment process. They did have good folks who worked in the call centers when I needed underwriting help
good,"meeting coordinating between clients and insurance agents, answering call and helping customers in understanding their coverage's, constant selling and promoting of discounts, sensitive handling with upset customers. call screening and in face interacting."
good,Farmers is a good company for benefits but they have some unfair compensation practices. The company will assist with getting a college degree but very few opportunities exist if you want to change departments after receiving your degree. They will not compensate for higher education unless you are promoted into another position.
good,"Farmers Insurance is a very nice place to work at. It is collaborative, creative and fun environment. The compensation is not that good, but management team will try their best to nurture your career progression."
good,"Typical claims work environment. Handling claims and dealing with customers on the field was great and the best part for me. Metrics were constantly changing so you can go from a superstar to subpar employee in a blink of an eye. Favoritism was very prevalent so the favored ones got the breaks when performance slipped, the non-favorites got put on a ""plan"". Chances for advancement are limited locally, available if you're willing to relocate."
good,"My experience with Farmers was overall a positive one. I learned a lot about an industry i previously knew nothing about. The work load was heavy and each day offered a new obstacle to break down, understand, and overcome."
good,"Compensation is not good. I've been there 5 years barely make 15$/hr. The attendance program is tough, but you can adhere to it you sacrifice a lot to do it. They don't offer any leniency toward illness or sick leave and I don't feel that is right."
good,I would recommend appointment setting opportunity's at Farmer's for anyone who is looking for Insurance Industry exposure. They provided quality leads to call upon and offered standard Call Center training.
good,Its a good experience in improving my professional skill set . encouraged Team work and do support during week end . Provided training's and certification . Improved work culture platform making me to enhance my level of proficiency.
good,"Great benefits. Short term incentive plan, vision, dental, medical insurance. 6% Company matching 401k contributions plus 4% additional. Education reimbursement. Work from home options."
good,once I knew my job was free to work it.  At times management would get aggressive when upset with another person or issues but would apologizes for any missteps once things calmed down.
good,"I was initially hired as an administrative assistant before receiving my P&C license.  Then I was hired as an agent.  Upon being hired as an agent, I was told that I would make $12 / hour, 50% of the firm's cut of commission, and 50% of renewals.  However, a week or so later, my boss drops a paper on my desk that says $12 / hour, and the firm keeps 90% of my commission, and 100% of renewals."
good,"Working at Farmer's was enjoyable work experience.  You had the support that you needed, everyone worked as a team.  Management was always there to support you / answer questions, etc.."
good,"This was a nice place to work but trying to pay bills with what your salary and commission was, it just didn't work for me. I had a mortgage and a car payment and some of the older agents I spoke to said it was going to be really tough for someone with a mortgage and a car payment to make ends meet unless I had another income stream coming in from a spouse."
good,"When I started with Farmers the company was great but through the years it has changed and has made it very difficult to succeed for the agents which makes it difficult for the support staff.  I am not sure what the future holds for Farmers and get a very unstable feeling. "
good,I enjoyed the people and culture and the benefits far out weigh other ins companies.  I enjoyed my work and the duties and responsibilities and the pay and yrly bonus.
good,"Start the morning with follow up emails, outgoing emails and phone calls for new business, get a list of people to send thank you cards and outline my afternoon for appointments and phone calls. The hardest part of my job was that the book of business was 85% Hispanic, I can speak and understand some but not enough to get through an entire conversation. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping clients understand the importance of life insurance."
good,This was a great company to work for.  I loved every minute of my day.  I do wish the hours were more flexible.  Miss the wonderful environment.  Needs to be closer to my home though.
good,it was a great small town office that head a great staff and manager/agent. The customers were great and generally kind and ready to give any information that you asked for
good,It is been nice to work in Farmers Insurance with different vendors.Got a great opportunity to learn about different guide wire systems.Improved myself with management skills and coordinating skills
good,Team working environment that worked together to provide coverages that fit the needs of our customers. Worked remotely & the office. The company was known for educating you to be the best counselor for our customers when it came to their insurance needs
good,"It's a good place to work for people looking to build residual income. Flexible hours, good working environment. Can be tough to maintain lead base. Need to be capable of working independently and being self disciplined."
good,"great experience but time demanding and stressful. worked from home office so could make own schedule field work as needed, company car provided home office set up"
good,"100% Commission"
good,"When I worked for the company, it was going through restructuring and new positions were being created and previous held positions were being phased out. The people were great to work with and everyone had an opportunity to provide input into how the job could be best accomplished. Support personnel had individual meetings to determine work flow and how to best and efficiently get the job done. Adjusters worked with each other and worked very well in a team environment."
good,Good company. Not much on hands on training but not bad. Thew company focus seems to be on auto and home insurance but not on life insurance and financial services
good,"Great place to work i just wanted to follow my dreams. The benefits are cool, their health insurance is high but if you can get around that great place to work"
good,"I was always busy, but enjoyed the job for the most part. Had great benefits and my co-workers and direct reports were fantastic people. Also, it was always great leading Virtual Triangles."
good,Very good company to represent. I am very proud about the work I did with Farmers because I learned a lot and represented a company that really cares about its insureds
good,A typical day of work would consist of sitting at a desk going through resumes' and evaluating potential canidates.  I would roughly do 80-100 phone calls per day to set up interviews.  I learned how to conduct a face to face interview by asking questions and learning more about the potential insurance agent.  My district manager was great to be around and always treated his employees with respect.  Hardest part of the job was being able to bring on potential agents.  We wanted people who wanted to be their own business owners and had the capital to back it up.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people in the office.  Everyone had the same goal and was a pleasure to work with.
good,"Great company overall. I love the people I wok with. I just wish they were more upfront with expectations. For example how they advised that numbers are not looked at for performance, but that's all they talk about and stress you about."
good,You will work for a company that pays off just be careful what agency you apply for not all agents manage their office the same. It is challenging but with a goo d business spirt you will succeed.
good,"challenging and competitive productive, but love to help people. enviroment is good. managial system is perfect  and easy. customer service is pretty perfect for client. all agents are really helpful to clients."
good,"This was a temporary assignment that I really enjoyed. I am fully bilingual and that helped me interact with the Spanish speaking customers and staff."
good,Working at Farmers gave me great base level experience working in a fast paced office environment. Farmers also gave me more experience with problem solving and dealing with difficult customers.
good,Farmers was a great place to start and move up. Multiple opportunities within and without claims department. Once was open to more entrepreneurial stay of management- no much more corporate or top level controlled organization.
good,Farmers Insurance has fantastic employee's to work with and the work environment is relaxed.  They provide excellent benefits and have good food in the cafeteria.
good,"open/close business most of the week days"
good,"Overall a good place to work. Like anywhere you have challenges but the training was good and I felt like I could always count on my team. communication and feed back was good, reviews timely and the flow was good."
good,"Great place to work, wonderful benefits. Flexible hours to help maintain work home life balance. Many great reasons to love this employer. 401k benefits are great."
good,"I am a customer service representative and I work for the agency with the agents. You have to have the ability to learn fast because there is a lot of information to learn, if you don't have the experience already. Most of the agents that I've dealt with have been extremely helpful in assisting you in getting your Property and Casualty license. Agent is very lenient when it comes to flexible hours and time off. However a typical day at work is hectic and busy. It is rewarding career those who are serious in the insurance industry."
good,Great opportunity for someone who has the time to build a book of business and can wait few years for income to meet the time put in.  Lead lists aren't great but some are good. Good support from corporate. Not great they have oversaturated market with insurance offices making the piece of pie smaller and more competitive
good,"Farmers insurance group offers opportunity for advancement. With a one on one relationship with the agent and other employees, the environment becomes friendly. You get to meet many people everyday with many different needs."
good,The agency owner came from a Health brokerage back ground and she wanted me to help her with the agency part of things. We started to contact more and more of her former health customers.
good,Well...They offered a company car that could be used for personal use.  It doesn't get much better with that with the increasing cost of fuel.   Overall a great place to work but the salary was not necessarily competitive
good,"Farmers is great if you have a great manager/Boss. I want to leave farmers because the compensation is not high enough for me, and the job security is just not there. It is all commissions, and if you dont sell policies you don't make money."
good,The training experience was very hands on and my fellow coworkers were great to work with. Learning how to specifically help each customer and their needs was rewarding. Working here helped me understand my own insurances and what adjustments I could want or be eligible for in the future.
good,I am a people person and love working with people in health care. My job was very rewarding in that way and many others. My knowledge and experience worked very nicely with this job.
good,Farmers is a good place to own an agency. With the recent internal structural changes currently provides little opportunity on the employee side.  Focus on owning an agency and you can make a lot of money
good,I worked for Farmers for over 8 years and would be there still if they werent relocating my department to another state. Management are knowledgable good hearted people.
good,"Great company with pretty good benefits and culture. The management is a little disjointed in their priorities in my department. One day we're focusing on one thing, then next day focusing on something else. Typical of any big company though."
good,I worked in office and from home on analyzing data from past years and creating new reports for business growth.  I also worked on data input for current accounting reconciliations.
good,"Wonderful coworkers, everyone is helpful and positive. The job itself can be difficult and compensation is pretty much luck based on if you can drum up enough business. Not much job security."
good,"Good place to work, can be hard to move up because there are many applicants trying to move up. Reasonable pay and hours. Good training program and nice paid time off."
good,"Need funds to support yourself for couple of years to really start making a good living.  People were great, training was very good but needed time to learn and additional money to support my career."
good,Fairly slow-paced environment with a little to no interaction with co-workers except at breaks or lunch.  Quite a bit of mundane tasks and form letter operations over the course of a typical day.
good,I have liked working for this company. Room for advancement. I would recommend this company to a friend. I have learned a lot in my time with this company.
good,There is nothing like residual Income to pay you continuously every time there is a renewal. There is plenty of opportunity to change your life style in this industry.
good,"Good place, benefits are nice.  On the phone all day but its a call center. Have to work up the chain to get a better shift. Holidays are paid well. ."
good,Great company with great people. There is a clear line of sight to the customers as well as to executive leadership. The company is focused on Customer Experience as well as Employee Engagement. What more can you ask for?
good,A challenging work environment that provides opportunities to succeed.  Management team is supportive though limited due to subsidiary of a large international insurance organization.
good,"its a good place to work at to get experience in sales, sometime sit is hard to get people to want to change to Farmers since their rates keep getting higher and higher"
good,It is a slow paced job as long as you are not in sales. The balance of work and life is tough with insurance as it can be around the clock. The people you work with though are fantastic and they make the day go by very quickly.
good,"Farmer's did a great job introducing and training new hires. They wanted to make sure you were very prepared before sending you off to do the job, but they closed down the facility and did their best to help with the transition."
good,"All aspects of auto/home/life insurance, working up quotes, sending any and all correspondence to the customer. His customers have given me compliments."
good,Farmers is a place that offers you a change to start a career and slowly work your way up. It takes some time to move around and grow but there are options. Very family oriented organization that is willing to help.
good,"The subrogation office of Farmers Insurance is a tight knit group and enjoyable place to work. Most cons would come from the actual job itself and limited opportunities to advance. Good compensation for the work, however."
good,I learned a lot about the insurance industry.  The office was culture was great.  The new agents were the best part of the job because of their excitement.
good,By far is the people.  Everyone on our team are dedicated and willing to put in the extra mile to accomplish our deliverables.  We take time to celebrate success as well.
good,"Good experience for those interested in sales and building their personal brand within a well known company. They provide licensing if you want to become an agent, but there are also other job opportunities."
good,"Always was predictable, very easy and smooth. Working with people is always nice. Learn new things everyday. The company was about selling insurance, mostly life insurance. Had to call to report claims."
good,"I can honestly say that I met some of the nicest people at this company. Prior to 2007, the company had a number of long term employees and treated them well with a lot of benefits a good family oriented culture. Not sure how it is now, but I enjoyed working there for the most part."
good,This was a very family oriented atmosphere to work in. This company made sure that the employees came first.  They always noticed hard work and rewarded their employees.
good,"I have been employed with Farmers Insurance Group for 31 years.  Overall, the company is stable, so if you are employed, there is minimal risk of the company going through drastic changes.

good,Spent 28 years with the company. Great coworkers and good management. Good benefits which included a generous profit sharing program.
good,"take claim calls all day and help people in need. "
good,"ok place to work, benefits and compensation could be better.  Very focused on leadership however little opportunity to grow in this area.   Plans to grow did not work out and enviroment was stale."
good,"Excellent benefits, good training programs, definite opportunity to advance.  Hours can be flexible if needed. Phone intensive environment in either auto insurance sales or service."
good,"Overall, I enjoy  working  for a great company such as Farmers insurance, I Would recommend employment per my family/Friends"
good,"A typical day at work includes opening the office 4 out of 5 work days, preparing the waiting room for clients and checking our computer system for any critical alerts, voicemails and emails. Work office is small with 4-6 co workers, however, management is acceptable."
good,Rates were a bit high and undercut by the competition.  Setup costs where higher that expected and sales volume with 2 CSRs provided breakeven revenue at best.  Takes about 3 years or more and substantial seed capital to make the business turn a profit.
good,The change in management caused a change in the job. This was a very good job with the exception of the micro management at the end of my time there. I am grateful for the time I had there and we only parted ways due to the change in the company structure. At the beginning it was just billing breakdowns and policy details where at the end I was an actual licensed agent doing everything except for writing new business for our auto and home product. The job offered great benefits and bonuses every year they attempted to make the environment fun but weren't able to pull it off. The hardest part of the job was not being treated as an adult or being respected. The best part of the job was being able to talk an angry customer down and helping them understand all of their options not just the option of trying another company. It didn't always work but when it did I walked away knowing that I was in the right space at the absolute correct/right time.
good,Farmers paid well and always had incentives to motivate the employess.  While there were many employees within the company I never felt like just a number.
good,A typical Insurance IT industry with lots of learning opportunities. Colleagues are more friendly and fun loving. The office are well located in and around LA.

good,High emotions on a daily basis. Angry customers - either from being in an accident or having their rates increased. Very hard market - not very competitive prices to offer customers
good,"This carrier is not as competitively priced as other leading carriers in the industry.  Co-workers and owner agent are very nice to work with. This company has been good to work for, temporarily."
good,"Good people, very intelligent and hard working.  Felt more like a team  than most places.  Many opportunities for professional growth."
good,This is an excellent place to grow in a corporate environment especially in Los Angeles. Other employers really like Farmers on your resume because they assume you have good work ethic in a team environment.
good,"Solutions focused executive with accomplished experience heading the successful implementation of multi-million dollar projects for business users focused on software developments and customization. Decisive, action-oriented and results-focused professional offering 10 years of experience in the insurance and financial industry with the last 2 years focused on executive management of project implementation."
good,"I am the only employee for a Farmers agent and handle the office while the agent is away.  I handle all the taxes for the agency and the payroll."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering multiple phone lines, sales, customer service. data entry. A good team to work with. The hardest part about the job is making sure that everyone is on the same page."
good,"Through my time at Farmers I was able to work with some very hardworking and honest people.  The environment is somewhat relaxed but it is a larger corporation.  The benefits were good and the Paid Time Off program was nice.  The only downside to working at Farmers is some of the local managers are not very transparent with their actions and seem to be there simply because they were friends of the hiring manager.  However, this was not the norm from my viewpoint but it did happen on a somewhat limited basis."
good,"Management is very flexible when it comes to work hours,as long as clients are taken care of and your work is done."
good,"Great job.  Management was great and very friendly.  Everybody worked with you and most people were very helpful.  Typical day included lots of cold-calling, communicating via internet with potential clients, and networking.  Hardest part of the job was being able to meet your quota each quarter.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with lots of different people and learning a great deal about the insurance and financial services industry."
good,Whether in the classroom or supporting individual business owners; I help Bridge the gap between corporate and sales by working in partnership with agents to help them achieve their vision.

good,I enjoy Farmers Insurance work environment.  There is a very strong team spirit there from leadership members to project coordinators.
good,"great promotional abilities, on sight training for new positions, and good team work atmosphere"
good,"This was a contract job for me, so I didn't get to enjoy the holiday pay or any of the other typical benefits associated with a full time position, but I did find myself liking everything about the facility I worked in and the people I cooperated with. I learned a fair amount about less common software like Lotus Notes and HP's SM9 ticketing system as well as proprietary remote connection software. The hardest part of my job was knowing when to escalate and pass on specific calls. We were a level 2 support position technically, but were very specialized. The most enjoyable part of this position was feeling like you'd really accomplished something when you got through one of the tougher problems that came up."
good,Providing customers with the right coverage for every insurance need. I learned how to make a personalized quote to fit a customers wants and needs. The co-workers are very friendly and great to work with. I also worked B2B to grow a larger client base.
good,"great environment, great leadership, great training, but minimal advancement options"
good,Overall great place to work at. Spent almost 3 years working as a personal lines underwriter. Learned a lot about the insurance industry. Job was in a call center setting.

High stres and customer service focused. Important to properly indemnify customer and not overpay claim while still providing excellent service."
good,"Typical Insurance agent duties. Customer acquisition, Marketing Strategies,Working and assessing customer needs,Quoting Insurance Policies, Building customer relationships,Working within a professional setting."
good,"I enjoy working for Farmers, though my job is one of the lowliest and hardest; telemarketing. Cold calling is tough and the tactics we have to use to get a quote are unimpressive. I don't like being a salesman, I simply like selling a good product, and Farmers offers good products, but that doesn't mean everyone will take a quote from me. "
good,"Assist customers with a wide array of issues including dispute resolution.                           Process payments, explain policy coverage and make changes when necessary.    Attempt to calm irate customers in a professional manner and determine the best way to maintain a good relationship.                                                                                             Assist customers with alternate payment arrangements should they need assistance.  Solicit new products or services when appropriate, Cold call prospective customers to bring in new business, Keep a detailed record of customers' interactions"
good,"Working at Farmers was a wonderful experience. Essentially during my time there, I handled phone calls, filed call lists, created my own call lists, and set up meetings with potential clients that i eventually met with personally. I learned a lot about sales and how to use unique customer service as a competitive advantage. I had always been good with people, therefore as soon as i started working I immediately felt comfortable and thrived in my position. The hardest part of the job would have to be traveling out of the area to meet with potential clients. Even though traveling was the hardest part of the job, it was also the most enjoyable part. I came to realize that nothing feels better in this field than traveling into someones environment, and leaving it knowing that you were able to sell someone on a product or service that was obsolete to that person not too long ago. "
good,"I have enjoyed my time here.  The environment is good"
good,"A normal day is busy balancing calls, meetings and claims work. The people, adjusters, are great people who work hard every day."
good,The compensation wasn't adequate. But it was very easy to work for the agent. There was not a well trained customer service department that made some of the work much more difficult.
good,"a typical day at work - dairy, claims, phone calls"
good,great company over all to work for and a profitable career path if committed
good,"Responsibilities includes demonstrate of sales prospecting, consultative sales process, world class training, managing a business, recruiting, agent training and lead management."

good,"Working in the insurance industry has been a great opportunity. My work time is utilized prospecting new markets, developing marketing strategies and initiating sales campaigns. I work as an independent producer for a successful insurance agent who provides me with support and feedback on my sales process and how to improve utilizing a variety of strategies. The challenges in the industry is that the insurance industry is a saturated and competitive market. Prospecting a constant flow of new clients can be difficult, especially in a down economy. My focus is on life insurance products and I enjoy promoting the awareness regarding the affordability and importance of protecing one's family and greatest assets."
good,Farmers Insurance Group is a great place to work. They have a strong management team that stands by their core values and best practices.
good,Developed as an Enterprise Architect. Co-workers are friendly and cooperate.
good,Flexible work schedule and a fun place to work. The company has great support to help you build your own agency.
good,This experience for me was a very work hard/play hard type of position. We did alot of team building events that were fun.
good,I love working for Farmers but there is really no advancement unless I want to become an Agent.
good,work hard very busy help point
good,"Count cash - balance drawer, send out dormant letter, answer incoming calls, wait on members, marketing, loans, etc. This job had alot of responsibility, a two girl office. I learned how to work under pressure. My boss was located in another state, so didn't see who was doing most the work in the office. The hardest part of the job was running the branch by myself alot of the time, due to co worker always calling in. The most enjoyable part of the day was waiting on members and helping them with their finances."
good,As agency owner I loved the challenge of managing your own business. Work hours were long and often stressful but I think it brought out the best in me.
good,• Order credit score and prepare sales contract for new customers.
good,"I was assigned the job of audatex, the entry of the data for the calculations of the cost of the auto repair. I would enter the data, and process the checks for the payment of the repairs. Time was of the essense."
good,"Customer service is top priority, filing, client updates and calls, managing clients and scheduling appointments for the agent. This job is not hard at all it is all about prioritizing. The best part of the job is the clients. Either talking on the phone or when they come in to make changes or pay their bills."
good,"The staff is great, and all works together well. Good opportunity for a self-starting individual, who is willing to work however long to get the job done."
good,"Like helping people, and making sure they are insured correctly."
good,This is a call center position.  The emplyee is on the phone taking inbound calls all day.  You must adhere to call handle and work time.  There is scripting that must be read on every call. If miss scripting or areas on calls get exceptions.  If too many exceptions occur can be terminated.
good,"It's a good place to work. However, there is little opportunities for advancement without relocating to another state. I have learned a lot but the position can feel mundane over time."
good,"Great company that truly values diversity, inclusion and charitable giving to the company.  Customer service is a focus and the Catastrophe Team is second to none in the industry."
good,"While there is a great culture there it is difficult to get by because agents are paid on commission, so there is not a lot of money in it.  As a commercial agent I have to identify potential leads and devise marketing strategies.  This means I spend quite a bit of time on the road going door to door."
good,"I learned a lot. I did applicant's work for 25 years, and i learned all about the medical liens/providers, medical fee schedule. Employer level of investigations, taking depositions. Lien Unit"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Farmer's Insurance. They are really like a family. Out of all the jobs I ever worked they had the most employee appreciation. They pay was good, the boss were understanding and taught you thoroughly. They only problem was this one vindictive supervisor. She was very deceitful and held petty grudges. And lastley when I arrived there was no room for shift advancements. I work 2nd shift and had no clue when the next shift bid was going to be. And alot of patience is needed for Spanish callers because and interpreter was needed.. A bonus if you were bilingual."
good,"Renewal income is very enticing as an owner..."
good,The agency I worked for was a good work environment and I enjoyed working with the Farmers products. They have a wide variety of products that make it easy to find the coverage that clients need.
good,"It's not exciting or hard, but it is reliable. Not a lot of drama, except for the usual customer service stuff. There is a lot of downtime in which you can either be proactive in finding new business or just browse the internet."
good,At times it was very slow.  Most of the day is spent cold calling and you will get hung up on.  We had a small office of just 3 people.  The people were mostly nice.
good,I enjoyed working for Farmers Insurance Group.  I was therec32 years.  I did quite a few different jobs in the Claims Department.  I also met many people throughout my years
good,"Corporate office has been easy to work with for the past 16 years. My current District Manager is honest and assists in growing my business. "
good,I moved up several times in my years with Farmers Insurance and was never held back from better opportunities. My only issue was that I was selling with and for Agents as I assisted them in becoming new start up Agency owners but there was a cap on my salary. I wanted commission as well.
good,"I learned to quote car insurance quotes. I learned to multi-task, answer incoming calls in a professional manner and also answer emails. I learned to help people when they have a claim due to an accident direct them and try to calm them down."
good,It is a good company when it comes to work/life balance. The benefits are fantastic. The work environment has pluses and minuses. I have enjoyed my five years at Farrmers.
good,"I actually really like Farmers, the company in itself is a great company. The starting pay is generous, and the training is in depth and extensive. They pretty much make sure your well prepared before getting on the floors. 1 thumb from me!"
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. I have a lot of health complications which require me to go to doctors regularly. Unfortunately all of my PTO (paid time off) went to doctor appointments and nothing else. I would have liked to have been able to go to the doctor without having to use PTO.
good,"I was employed on a split shift basis to place outbound calls for the agent from my home, so that he may meet with potential customers and possibly save them money and offer more coverage. At the time the position was a great experience but I ended up not liking working alone from home."
good,Good place to work and great people to work with.Good place to refer someone to work and great hours.Management is fair and respectful in the work place
good,"great place to gain experience - they give you plenty of time to learn and make mistakes. "
good,Best part was the people I worked with. The day was pretty much routine. Some times you were given assignments without much training. Enjoyed using the forklift and jacks.
good,"I very much enjoyed my time at Farmers. I feel it is a company of character, however it is lacking in certain areas. Compensation at Farmers is sub-standard in my view."
good,"Begin hired on to do marketing work was very exciting do to helping others, giving them knowledge about their risk, also did a lot of retail/service work. Managed book of business, hardest part about this position was that we were understaffed. I really enjoyed that I grew a lot, and learned a lot."
good,"Worked as an Agent with this company for 10 years. Great training program and assistance in getting agency started. Circumstances relating to catastraphes, etc. have made the oportunity much more challenging.  Reduction in Agent commissions not well received."
good,"Productive work place with a great Cafeteria."
good,"If you want to work in an environment that will be constantly changing and keep you on your A-game at all times, Farmers is the place for you!  They demand excellence and require a high level of focus on a daily basis.  You will grow exponentially in your sales and leadership skills while employed here.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility.  The hardest part of the job is never being able to turn it off."
good,"Repetition. Management is great and the company treats all employees as family. You are recognized for your accomplishments and offered training and coaching to help you reach your goals. The only downfall is you do not earn PTO or sick time. You simply are given 12 days per year and if those days are used and you are sick, you must come to work or will be terminated."
good,"Good work/life balance, good management, pay is adequate.  The work can be extremely stressful due to claim quantity and management expectations for handling same.  Benefits are second to   none but would be the best if a pension still existed."
good,Lots of room for growth with the right connections.  Can be very political at times. Call center atmosphere is not for everyone and can wear a person out.
good,I actually quite like it at Farmers. I just believe that my passion lies in technology. I have grown in my short time here and would recommend this as it is the best team on individuals I have worked with.
good,Most times I was at the office by myself or my bosses wife was there. We would have customers come in either looking to pay their bills or to add to their plan or a new client starting a new plan. I would code call in between clients coming in . Most days it was pretty slow. I learned how to work them system and how to put payments in. I learned how to code call and win clients over to change their insurance. The hardest part of the job was when clients would come in mad about their payments going up or something going wrong with their policy. Or when code calling and either being yelled at or hung up on. The enjoyable part about the job was my bosses wife.. even though we both didnt know what we were really doing we figured it out together.
good,"Farmers Insurance is generous when it comes to benefits. You are paid well and all of the other benefits are great. You do have to put in long hours when you're extremely busy, but that is the only real con about the job."
good,"nice place.  shouldn't have left.  Grass is always greener on the other side.  Nice place,  A lot of work.  Friendly people. Slow on technology.  Nice office job"
good,I think it’s a typical insurance company trying to balance making customers and employees happy. I appreciate that they found a place for me once my position was eliminated.
good,There are some hoops you will have to jump through once you get hired.  The politics are unbelievable. Sometimes you will feel setup for failure.  But it is a check.
good,"A typical day at work was very calm with the occasional  crazy afternoons, specially on Fridays most customers would walk in. I learned how to deal with Face to Face customer service and not just over the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere in the office."
good,"A typical day at my office includes team meetings, at least 2 appointments, prospecting activities.  The culture at the office is to always be producing, servicing or digging deeper to discover solutions to product or services related issues.  To be responsible and do what I say I will do.  The hardest part of the position is to balance service with sales and to keep organized the amount of paperwork.  "
good,"There are a lot of fun parts about being in the insurance industry, you have some freedom and it's awesome that we actually get to help people. There are many opportunities to receive bonuses and interact with the surrounding offices."
good,"Good benefits, good people, decent job in direct services. Room for advancement. Job isn't too difficult and you learn a lot. There are a good amount of opportunities"
good,"High pressure to sell.  Not customer focused, but transaction oriented.  Technology was weak and not reliable.  District sales support was non-existent."
good,Virtual office with few meetings.  Lots of benefits and good support staff.  Great teamwork.  Communication to field support needs to be improved with company perspective
good,"I enjoyed my years at Farmers, worked as a Field Adjuster, Supervisor, and Heavy Equipment Adjuster handling claims on everything from Tractor Trailers, Cranes, Farm and Construction equipment .Traveled all over the country."
good,As a customer service associate it was enjoyable to help others out during some of the worst moments in their life. To be able to assure them that we would take care of them if they had coverage was fulfilling.
good,"Farmers Insurance was nice and fun place to work at. Loved greeting and meeting new clients, Loved seeing clients when they'd get a good deal on car or home insurance."
good,could make your own hours. if errands needed to be ran you could take a little longer lunch or come in a little later. Manager was very understanding of life happenings.
good,"Farmers has a lot to offer from agents to office staff. If you work hard, you will get rewarded. Management is all about developing people and bringing them to their next step in their career."
good,great place and opportunity.  Lack of sales forced us to close.  Management was great but higher management harder to work with.  Hardest part was to generate sales during slow seasons.  Great to meet huge variety of people.
good,I was very happy with my career at Farmers Insurance.  I had to quit because I was moving to another state.  Otherwise I would have like to remain there.
good,"Good company to work for. Great agent always answered my questions and would always give me positive criticism. Farmers Insurance is a great employment opportunity for those who enjoy business,"
good,It was good to coordinate the agency force with the company and provide our customers with the best insurance available in the market.  It was good to see the agents and district managers succeed.
good,"The management is great and the pay is good. I just think it is way too much work and stressful. I tried reaching out to management to advise I was having trouble getting all my work done but the job was just that demanding and I was always behind. Even though I tried not to bring work home with me I always did. I could not sleep at times thinking of all the work I had pending, even on the weekends I would think of it."
good,"Overall a great job, but had it's disadvantage  with pressured time on calls that were not under your control as sometimes customers needed extra time for help. Not much room for promotions. Needed more detailed training before you reach the floor to take the amount of calls."
good,"World-class training, tailored benefits, and a rich history of charity and small beginnings are just a few things that have distinguished Farmers employees for more than 80 years."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs because my managers and coworkers were so great! It was a flexible and relaxed environment with good company and decent pay.
good,"Working as a Customer Service Representative for a Farmers agent can be very rewarding. If licenses, you can earn commissions on new business. The atmosphere is relaxed. and the clients are great."
good,"Great place to work, salary can be a bit low. Large company so you have places to move around if you would like. Some of upper management have old school views on things like working from home, remote. Other than that great."
good,A typical day at work is not so typical. No day is the same due to being faced with different scenarios everyday. I have learned alot in this position when it comes to customer service and empathy. Management and the workplace was pretty chill. The job was not hard but it did keep you busy. I enjoyed the flexiblity the most.
good,Processed inbound calls from agents.  Assisted in writing homeowner and rental policies.  The motto was consult/educate versus the typical  call center that was metrics based and only cared about average handle time.
good,"The job culture would improve if management was more concerned with treating the employees right than with where they will be going for dinner. It seems most employees are only numbers."
good,"A typical day at work was writing policies, answering phones and servicing client needs.  Calling existing customers to see if they would like to add a policy such as renters insurance or life insurance.  Call when clients were on notice of cancellation. I personally would go to apartment complexes to see if we could put a flier in the ""welcome to the neighborhood"" folder that was given to all new tenants.  Since I was the office Manager I always made sure the work environment was happy and upbeat.  The hardest part of the job was having to explain raises in rates, that was always a tough one for clients, I understood why and we all did our best to make it make sense to our clients.  My direct supervisor was great but he was never around, he traveled a lot.  His first language was Spanish so we had quite a few Spanish speaking clients which was hard for me but fortunately I was able to hire two bi-lingual associates. Overall I loved my job with Farmers."
good,"Each day was a different challenge,just as any customer service setting. I learned to organize my time wisely and keep busy at all times even when i had finished my assigned work."
good,"Great for someone who is interested in insurance and a steady, secure position.  It was definitely not for me because I'm starting in my career and I'm more interested in the dynamics of the tech industry."
good,"Great schedule, but unless you are working at an office that is on the ball you will struggle to get new business. The office I worked at was drowning in customer service calls from upset customers who's rates were shooting through the roof."
good,"Great people to work and I learned how to really communicate with people over the phone. Everybody treated me like part of the team right away and it was a friendly atmosphere. The hardest part was trying to connect all the calls to the specific person as they had another office in the same building.The only bad part about working in insurance is that you're doing the same thing over and over, it tends to get boring after a while. Overall I really enjoyed this opportunity and gained valuable experience"
good,"I very much enjoyed my first several years at Farmers. "
good,"As a marketing assistant I basically just sent out mailers, dealt with both of our agent's customers and their needs. I enjoyed the people I worked with a lot and our location was very friendly."
good,"For the exchange company, Commercial Team and Commercial billing is still in area but company moved out of State. Both are Call Center Environment and Farmers Agents are more respectful to the Commercial Team Members than they are with the Personal Lines Team Members."
good,"Productive workplace with clear goals.  I enjoyed working at Farmers and contributed to a winning team.  Development opportunities were available to those who sought them out.  Benefits were reduced while I was employed and continue to this day. Opportunities to advance your career depend heavily on your willingness to relocate. Farmers will help with continued education cost if you're looking to complete your MBA or CPCU. Work life balance was reasonable as I did not have to work over 50-60 hours a week most of the time. Farmer's leadership is open to fresh perspective and new ideas in order to improve current processes. The most difficult part of the job was networking outside of current line of business.  Farmers could be more willing to allow projects that include different areas of the business to contribute to the overall goal. Overall, Farmers is a great place to work if you're willing to take control of your career and seek out development opportunities."
good,Good place to work overall. Claims can be stressfull and has a high volume but the benefits are good and starting pay is good as well. They provide training and licenses necessary.
good,Learning from all kinds of people everyday is a great challenge and it builds my confidence as a person. Working with different types of clientelles helped me become more productive and knowing their principal needs ro render the proper kind of service.
good,Great flexibility. Enjoy helping people. I have gained confidence when I learned to train new hires and managing the. Insurance has slow months which makes it hard for agents to stay in business.
good,Have been with Farmers for a while now and they have been very accommodating allowing me to go to school and work part time. I appreciate that atmosphere and work hard when I am here because of it.
good,"this was another job through a temp, it was pretty good to me. very big place good food easy job. show up and do your work and you will love it. i found something better so i had to quit."
good,"Working for Farmers Insurance was a great experience. I learned there is more to just auto and home insurance, and how much work it takes to get a reasonable rate for each person."
good,The operations and support of IT were above average for the company employee's to come to work each day and know that the systems they would be working with would be stable.
good,I enjoyed working at Farmers the Call Center for Claims North OKC. My direct supervisors always did everything in their power to insure the success of the team. My position relied heavily on co-workers taking ownership while continuously keeping above average productivity goals. It was challenging and I appreciate all the skills I learned while being with the company.
good,"Initial pay is great, and benefits are above average. The company definitely places a large emphasis on not having people burn out or overwork themselves."
good,"In claims as a outside adjuster you will go to body shops and tow yards to inspect vehicles daily. Constant contact with insureds and claimants. Fast paced environment."
good,This company has a lot of flexibility so you are able to have a work/life balance. A lot of great people to work with. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking to get into the insurance business.
good,This place is a great place to work. It is very repetitive depending on which job you chose to do. Most of the upper management is very respectful.
good,It's not easy getting started as an Insurance Agent -- Commission based sales starts with low commissions because there are no renewal commissions until policies renew which takes time.
good,"amazing people"
good,"My experience with Farmers Insurance Group was good, like any company there are great employees, management, and co-workers and those who make your work life interested.  My experience was very good; however, I feel that employee support could be better as some employees have been let go by the company due to a mistake or error in judgement.  I worked at their service center on Grand Avenue and I-35 so I was on the phone calling to people all day."
good,Great attention was paid to rules and attendance. Training was acceptable. Good co-workers. Management was good to work with at this job.
good,A typical workday consists of both inbound and outbound calls. Insurance review for potential Clients. I only lacked the Motivation and Competition with which I am accustomed
good,"I always praise Farmers for their training in insurance policies and repair methods. Plus, you get a two week trip to Los Angeles to finalize your training! Pay was decent, good benefits and a great group of people."
good,"Overall, Farmers was a good place to work. I really enjoyed my time there. The job was rewarding and my coworkers were absolutely fantastic as well."
good,"Manager ,Co workers, Office Environment, Work culture, Debates celebrations everything is awesome except the place. No Indian community and surroundings are not that good."
good,As a CSR you help with the agency's daily needs and get to see insurance. You will also cold call leads and cross sell to current clients.
good,"Farmers was a pretty good company to work for. The office environment at this office was a little laid back. You didn't have to log into the photos which was nice. Just took you own phone calls."
good,Very supportive managers and supervisors. Heavy work load especially during peak seasons.  Competitive pay and benefits.  Politics regarding promotions.
good,"A typical day at work included: checking messages, servicing policies, cold calling for quotes, selling policies to new and current customers. I learned how to be a professional. I also learned a lot about the insurance industry and some things that help me choose my own insurance coverage. Since I was the longest employee working under Kym I worked with multiple new hires. The hardest part of the job was selling policies to people that are price shoppers. It is hard to explain to someone the benefits of your company when all they care about is the price. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. I really enjoyed talking to the people that came in. I learned something new everyday from a customer. The customers is what I miss most about the job. They all seemed really comfortable with me."
good,"Good company with good leadership team. Good benefits and paid time off.  Good benefits package.  "
good,"Farmers Insurance Group provided me with the skills and training necessary to run a small business.  Everyone was always helpful and available when needed."
good,"A typical day consists of utilizing client records to input data within a particular software, reconciling accounts payable and receivable accounts, assisting clients with change in policies or updating records regarding premiums.  "
good,"Excellent environment, i did not had any co-workers, working under pressure at times, working with customers a lot of clients call to make payments ;)"
good,"Though I enjoy working at Farmers Insurance, and my boss and co-workers are amazing, I am not able to advance, and the amount of hours I am able to work is very limited (though they are flexible), meaning that I can only work so much. The environment is very nice and quiet, and though I get to interact with customers over the phone, I'd much prefer to interact with them face-to-face."
good,The skills learned will be valuable throughout you career. The company offers ample opportunities for career advancement.
good,"I would take incoming calls from agents and insureds to go over policies, make changes, troubleshoot and take payments. Management was open about the company and included us in decisions that directly affected our department."
good,"Farmers offers a highly attainable and comprehensive training program for any and all employees."
good,farmers give you and opportunity to start your own business and allows you to be a hands on insurance agent for your clients.
good,"This was an internship"
good,"A typical day at work is answering the phones to assist a customer, this may include giving a quote, breaking down a bill, making changes on a policy, explaining the coverages on a policy, making billing adjustments on a policy."
good,"I've learned how to deal with different kinds of people, and how to manage some difficult situations. other than the agent who didn't know how to make a distinction between official and private matters, I've earned my experience."
good,Good company to work for with great work life balance. At times call volume can get very high with no breaks in between.
good,"Farmers is a good company to work for because they are flexible, fun and have good benefits. There aren't as many opportunities as there should be."

good,"•	Service incoming calls for personal lines automobile insurance policies, including but not limited researching policy information"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phone calls from insurance agents who represent the company. We were provided a plethora of resources and tools in order to answer questions they would have about coverage offered for personal lines policies. The management was welcoming and offered assistance and advice whenever needed. Because it was such a large corporation, there were many different kinds of people of all ages and from all backgrounds working in the same office. At times, this created a conflict within the culture, but at other times it brought people closer together. The most difficult part within this position was staying calm and helpful to all customers, even those who were extremely frustrated. However, I also did enjoy getting to interact with so many different kinds of people on a daily basis,"
good,"I love helping people with there insurance needs. A typical day involves quoting, calling and closing policies. Average quotes per day would be anywhere from 20-30"
good,"Training new agents"
good,"Very flexible work schedule with remote capabilities and opportunity for telecommuting. Very collaborative management style within the branch legal office. Friendly, supporting co-workers. Hardest part of the job: extensive reporting, transfer of adminstrative/clerical duties to attorneys. Most enjoyable part of the job: flexibility."
good,"I absolutely loved having my own Farmers Insurance Agency.  I worked harder than I've ever worked in my life, but the payoff and commissions were great.  The hardest part of the job was being everything. By that I mean, you trained, supervised, sold, marketed, managed all aspects of the financials etc.... Since my agency was along the Gulf Coast in Alabama, when Katrina hit, the company began to make decisions that made a significant impact to us as agents and business owners.  In the end, I chose along with other agents to walk away due to the unknown. I would do it again, but in a different area."
good,Discussable at Interview - Basically in running an agency you must be adept at many different skills
good,Management is good and there is a lot of room to grow. Commission is also very fair if you sell Insurance.
good,I do everything from answering the phone to helping co-workers with our claims system.  I enjoy helping people.  Farmers is a good company to work for and the people I work with are the best.....

good,Great work environment and great managers who are willing to listen to suggestions from employees.
good,"I work 6:30a-3:00p Monday-Friday at Farmers Insurance Group doing basic Accounting clerk work. I enjoy my job working on a team but also being able to work as an individual to finish projects/assignments by projected due dates. I have a very understanding management team that is supportive of any questions or concerns I may ever have within the company or even outside of work with my personal life. The hardest part of my job is working on such a small team (5 people), it makes group projects more difficult to complete but everybody, including myself, puts all of our focus into what needs to be done and make sure at the end of the day that our customers are 100% satisfied!"
good,"My day consisted of contacting and assisting the customers of the day to bring their issues to the perfect resolution.  I learned a lot of customer service skills, learned how to work with different personalities in an office environment, not all coworkers are the same so learning how to get along with them in order to achieve the goal was invaluable.  The hardest part was working with the difficult customers who felt they were entitled to more than what was fair and reasonable.  The most enjoyable part was learning something new every day.  The only reason I resigned from this job was due to the location closing.  I would have had to transfer to a location more than 60 miles away and with 3 kids in school this was not an option.  "
good,A difficult part of my job is not having the ability to create new tasks. I enjoy seeking alternatives and cost efficient methods to recruiting while accomplishing my recruiting goal. I appreciate enthusiasm and eagerness to learn as well as being part of a company that values an individuals quality.
good,Great chance to own your own business and be your own boss.  Management expects your to eventually be a manager of your agency rather than focus on sales.
good,Took about 150 calls a day. Team work. Co-Workers were great. Most enjoyable was talking with customer's.
good,"good benefits, lots of opportunity with new management, decent work hours "
good,"i enjoy my job due to the fact that i love typing. this is mainly what my job consists of, other than faxing and filing. i became an expert at Microsoft excel. my co-workers are all friendly and fun to work with. the job honestly is common sense, nothing about it is difficult. i enjoy having lunch daily with and talking to my co-workers."
good,I was a part of something special. A great experience. My boss has moved on to become a district manager located in Iowa. This is where I learned to run a business and it helped me to run my own.

good,Daily basis of follow up with clients. Input data and sales in quickbooks. Process closing cash accounts. The co-workers were great overall.
good,Contacted potential new clients by making cold calls. Write email communications to perspective businesses. Met or Visited new business leads. Knowledge of new products and services.
good,• Knowledge of homeowners/ auto policies and procedures.
good,I learned I am very good at prioritizing and getting all of my work done before the day is done. I have learned a lot of multi-tasking skills and improved my computer skills. I have worked a lot with Microsoft Office. I have had a lot of touch clients call in but usually can help them out. I really enjoy talking to different people every day. Because of my hard work and dedication I was promoted into a management position which was tough at first as I had never managed employees. I have grown to love a management role.
good,Long hours on the phone investigating claims and making decisions regarding liability.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Farmers Insurance is being able to interact with customers.
good,"Direct contact with attorneys, providers, medicare and medicaid and sub offices. Reviewing and verifying documents to make payments of medical claims for first party clients. Adjusting the overall volume for payment with an initial investigation and review of injuries sustained."
good,"Was a appoinment setter for all agents in office, also assisted agents on annual reviews, educated customers on upcomng products."
good,"Working with Farmers in the Total Loss Department taught me a lot about myself. The job was commonly quoted as being the hardest position available at the facility. With that fame also comes the promise of a different position once you have reached the time-in-position requirement to transfer. If you can make it in this department, you can make it anywhere else in the company. Day to day tasks aren't terribly difficult, but there's going to be a few wrenches thrown in there on a daily basis as each claim was unique and had to be handled as such."
good,"Overall my employment with Farmers was a valuable learning experience. It is truly a sales and marketing driven career, I enjoyed getting out in front of potential customers and helping to improve their coverage or lower their premiums."
good,I am currently working at one of the centralized claims centers that processes a variety of insurance claims. The environment is nice and comfortable but you are in a cubicle environment all day w/little opportunity to interact w/your co-workers. Your interactions w/customers are via the phone or email w/no physical contact. The hardest part of the job is the never-ending amount of claims that you receive and the limited amount of time that you are given to resolve them. The management team is very well-rounded and do their best to motivate and improve your performance. The vast majority are very encouraging and helpful w/a wide range of experience and work to improve your experience at work. There are limited opportunities for advancement as most positions are at the same limited salary grades - regardless of the department. There is alot of emphasis on trying to make it a well-rounded workplace that encourages a lot of community involvement. There are usually wide variety of fund-raisers and extra activities that are sponsored by management to break up the monotony of the daily grind. You are doing the same thing - day in and day out w/little variety in your workload.
good,I have been working for data entry and office work for 12 years.
good,"The transition into this organization started out bumpy, however over time I learned how phenomenal it was to work at this company."
good,Farmers was a great company to work for I feel really valued as an employee. The only difficult part was answering phones all day. It takes a certain person.
good,"Is a good company to work for it, their products are very competitive in the Insurance market, they are redirecting their businessmore to the life insurance plans other that the regular home and auto plans that have been the core of their business"
good,Good & gainful Employment which I’ve been successfully employed for nearly 15 years.   Looking to use all skills gained from my employer in a Human Resource or other customerbased area.
good,I worked for a independant broker I did not work for the corporate office. Working for a broker has its positive and negative.  Farmers was  the second company I worked for insurance and by far enjoyed helping customers with their options they had to offer.
good,Excellent opportunity for energetic career person.  Must be outgoing and able to give an ample amount of time and not have medical needs of other family members requiring your time.
good,"My experience was perfect at the time  however, medical issues kept me from fully commuting.  Although the training was intense, the company supported you through the ptocess"
good,"I really enjoyed the people at Farmers.  I learned a lot, the work place was clean and comfortable.  The clients were friendly and nice.  Had a lot of good experience there."
good,Farmers insurance is a great company that’s stands by their customers. I enjoy being a Customer Service and Sales Representative and I enjoy helping people find the best coverages for their lifestyle.
good,"Got opportunity to directly with clients."
good,"Great place to work, very supportive. This company is very competitive with other insurance companies. They do work with there employees and try to make the experience worth whiled"
good,"Unrealistic expectation from the management. In order to meet your numbers, working overtime each day is a must. You also have to go out to meet with customers in order to settle a claim and can find yourself in some pretty seedy areas."
good,"I enjoyed working for the previous agency owner for 13 years; the new agency owner is a different story. He is a nice guy, but not cut out for this job - he is not a natural salesperson."
good,"You are in charge of your future.  It is up to you to cultivate a winning "
good,Good place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful as well as management.  Training is long but very beneficial.  Benefits and healthcare options are outstanding.
good,"Great place to work, nice people from leads to managemant. they have a free dress day free coffee day free popcorn day onsite cafetiera with great food. call come in fast and slow it depends on the day"
good,"I did mostly call center work. It gets tedious to be on the phone all day. Unless you ask or stand out as an employee, its unlikely they will let you do other activities besides taking phone calls. Talking more than 5 hours straight can be very difficult."
good,"a great learning experience, I do not think i would ever work there again.  There is absolutely no training within certain districts.  I was not impressed how they set you up for failure"
good,I enjoyed working here and learning about insurance. The other employees were easy to work with and were willing to help with whatever I needed help with.
good,"Great benefits with usually a pretty good direct management team. However, decisions are made in a vacuum at the corporate level and are usually not in the best interest of people in the field."
good,"The office I worked at was a nice office.  Fast paced but at times relaxing. The owner and his wife ran the office.  My supervisor was his wife and she was very enjoyable to work for.  The other people in the office were also enjoyable to work with."
good,most of the compensation will be 100 percent commission and even then it is a cutthroat sales environment. Managment is good and will help you if you ask for it.
good,work is okay. A lot of phone calls and fast paced environment. Good company plus products are good although sometimes not cheap compared to other companies
good,"An average day at Farmers Insurance was slow paced and relaxed. Working this position taught me the importance of organization and paying attention to detail. The hardest part of the job was that somedays I had large amounts of tasks to complete, but I love a challenge. Overall, I enjoyed working this position. It supplied me with experience working in a office setting."
good,"Great place to work.  Was told tasks when offered job, but find out later on there are additional tasks you would be responsible for.  New to industry and feel a little overwhelmed."
good,"It was a chilled and peaceful job, wasn’t has hard as I thought it would be. I was mostly alone so I wasn’t bothered by anyone. I was able to work on my own schedule which was also cool"
good,"While working for Farmers Insurance, I worked for 3 different agents.  I thoroughly enjoyed helping clients with their coverages and billing questions.  I worked with amazing co-workers, and my boss was great at being an agent.  I would cross sell when I felt the time was appropriate to cross sell, not all situations are appropriate for cross selling.  My main job was not as a sales agent, but as a customer service representative."
good,"I enjoyed the management at Farmers. My bosses and co-workers were great, it was just the lack of satisfaction in the industry I was in. Didn't feel like I was helping people and couldn't see myself working there long term."
good,I really enjoyed working at Farmers Insurance because I was a college student and was able to study when we had downtime. Every agency is different but my agent was very flexible and if I had class he would let me take the day off. Really great for a college student.
good,"I was downsized and removed from the company.   Otherwise, Its a good place to work.   I would suggest others to take a look at Farmers."
good,"Good company with a positive culture and team environment.  Personally, I am not able to relocate and because of this, opportunity is limited in my region."
good,"Answering phones, assigning claims to our claim representatives to provide excellent customer service during their time of need, being apart of the 3 offices for clerical duties."
good,"This was a great job and flexible office job, especially for a woman with small children. Some days were fast paced and some days slower than usual, it was a nice day to day change."
good,"The establishment was a small business, it was just the owner and myself so the atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back.  The owner was very easy to get along with, unfortunately I needed a job with more hours and better pay."
good,"Large company with quite a few opportunities. Great training programs, leaders, and competitive benefits. Regardless of where you are in your career or what you're interested in, there's a position for everyone."
good,"Calling people to quote there home and auto."
good,"Working at Farmers allows the agent an opportunity to help individuals, families,churches, and small businesses protect their property, and posterity."
good,"Farmers Insurance is a great place to work if you want to gain experience, have a fair amount of job security, and have options to move within the company.  Their compensation feels fair and benefits are on-par with other corporate sites.  Depending on the department, flexible work hours and one day work from home is available."
good,"Farmers is a very reputable company that strives to please its customers. I had a very positive experience with my regional management. They were extremely generous and anxious to assist us with anything and everything. The most frustrating part of the job is the computer programs not being consistent, resulting in long waits on hold for assistance. The best part of the job is the clients who are almost all great and appreciate great customer service."
good,My network was weak and I didn't excel at this commission based job. Management was nice and informative. I had trouble selling the product because if you shop price farmers is not the cheapest. Never fell in love with my product to make sales easy.
good,This a good job as a Field BI adjuster with a company car.  However they eventually did away with the car.  I left this job looking for more advancement opportunities
good,There are a wide variety of departments so there is a position for all personality types.  They invest in their employees and overall this is a great company to work for.
good,The staff here are very supportive. They always make sure you have learned and be flexible with your working schedules. I really like and miss all the people and the customers when I worked here.
good,I got to talk to diffrent personalities of business.  I had no supervision due to that i always was doing my job at a timely matter.  Setting Appointment for the agent.
good,"Love working here but after so many years advancement becomes a ""THING"" and it seems as though they would like to keep you in the position THEY feel you are good at."
good,"The claims industry is not an easy one- you're dealing with people who have had one or more very bad days, and so providing impeccable service can be trying, but the sheer number of claims which will need your attention is likely the most stressful portion of the position."
good,Size of company hinders districts from getting the flexibility needed to properly equip the district for long term growth. Corporate makes decisions that hurt individual districts and the employees within those districts.
good,"a typical day consists of reviewing new claims, returning voicemails to customers, drafting disclaimers and releases for bodily injuries and property damage.  reviewing medical bills and estimates with management. "
good,Decided to change careers and Farmers gave me an opportunity.  Learned about the role of insurance in daily living and the necessity to follow instructions when applying discounts/surcharges and modifying coverages.
good,It is a great place to work. Good pay. Shifts are fixed but you can bid for others as they become available. Take claims from customers. This is a call center where most of the calls are inbound. Do have some outbound calls.
good,"Farmers Insurance was my very first job. The job gave me an opportunity to make my experience with customer service so much better then what I knew before. I learned how to talk to people much easier, my computer skills are much better,and ect."
good,"Farmers company culture is vastly different from the way it was the first 9 years, to the point where change is done for the sake of change, audits were unfairly harsh and they were looking for ways to get rid of people 5 years ago."
good,"A typical day for me is answering phones , helping customers with their billing and coverage reviewing policies , writing new policies and insurance helping co workers to explain coverage to customers , training  billing reminders , etc. I am a fast paced worker and always strive to get everything done in a timely manor ."
good,It was a small office and we all got along. If someone needed help we would always assist in what ever we could. Management was family oriented which made it easier to work in he office. The hardest part of the job was getting into the pace of the office. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with my coworkers and management.
good,there is nothing to write regarding this postion.  It was not something to report to the general public.  I have made many friends there through the years so it is a good place.
good,Various positions offer a variety of activities and opportunities.Great evnvironment. Lots of wonderful people and activities geared towards employees. Many opportunities to engage in community outreach as well.
good,"The staff I worked with worked well together toward a common goal."
good,I  feel I was always treated fairly; and given an opportunity to express my opinion.  I worked at Farmers Insurance for 11 years; and left in order to start my own home-based business after getting my litigation paralegal certification.  The income received was somewhat low; but that was what Farmers paid me at the time.  I might have gone up in salary after obtaining my litigation paralegal training; but I desired a change and an opportunity to operate my own home-based legal support business.  The most enjoyable part of my stay at Farmers was participating in Profit Sharing..     .
good,"A company that tries very hard to keep people happy. Management for the most part are very knowledgeable, understanding and care about doing things right."
good,It was a congenial atmosphere but the job requirements were significantly different from what I was use to at my former job with State Farm.   The hardest part was making the transition after 10+ years at State Farm.  I felt that I had made a successful transition but the culture at Farmers was significantly different than State Farm. The jobs were similar but there was a different approach to handling claims. There was more independent work rather than a team approach as existed at State Farm.
good,"Farmers Insurance has plenty growth opportunities, and primarily hires from within the company. There are multiple avenues to venture depending on the candidates skill-set. Undergraduate and Graduate candidates have the ability to have a lucrative career with Farmers."
good,"This job was very good. You had to be able to multitask , answer phone , schedule appointments . Be responsible and very organized to work in an office space environment."
good,Good place to learn office skills. Slow paced. Manager willing to show you step by step. You could learn many skills but could not advance. Good customer service was very important.
good,Love working here. Great family environment where people actually care about one another. It's a little old fashioned but the people have hearts of gold.
good,"Professional work environment, management supports staff, stands behind staff, too heavy a caseload. Distributing of files not even. No Micro management."
good,"Farmers is always working to improve and grow so lots of opportunity to drive your results.  For the most part, there are opportunities to advance and grow through education."
good,There's a lot of work to go around. People are supportive and management tries to help. At peak times everyone can be stressed but there is an effort to help with work life balance.
good,"Manager was very good, helped in training and direct with what was needed. Agents and staff were great to work with. Had good responsibility and able to work independently."
good,Very relaxed. Nice place for a high school student needing a little extra cash. Very easy job. I don't believe they are in business anymore. It was a nice after school job.
good,It's a job with a lot of responsibilities. It teaches you a lot about how to be organized and how to communicate with others. A lot of skills are gained from working here.
good,I learned a lot about office management. I learned how to talk to people a little better. I always felt good about going into work because of the services we provided.
good,Great opportunity to learn about the many insurance products.  Farmers does a great job in placing you in a position of opportunity to have your own office.
good,"i loved working here the manager was so sweet."
good,"I loved one of my bosses. But it's hard to advance from a reception job. The environment is nice and small. You really get to know the job quickly. All in all, it was a positive experience"
good,I am a rural Claims Rep. Day involves 4-5 hours of driving on average. Claim volume spikes during hail season which provides over time opportunities. Need to be able to manage a large territory to efficiently manage claims.
good,"Good place to work. Learned a lot about insurance. Good people to work with. Family friendly agency. Supportive co employee, good training. Always learn new product."
good,I learned about the insurance sales industry and  what it takes to run a successful insurance agency. My district manager was very knowledgeable and encouraging.
good,"it was a very nice office to work at . i had a very giving employer"
good,"- Answer inbound calls from customers "
good,I choose to not review this employer.  I do not feel is in important to a job search.  This information should be a choice and not a requirement to go forward.
good,"You can connect with an agent, get a quote, report a claim and check on its status, find the number to call for towing and roadside help and more. You’ll find ample resources to help with your claim, as well as a checklist of what to do in an accident."
good,This is a family business which I enjoyed working.  I was able to keep regular hours and salary was pretty good with commission.  The downside was that I realized I didn't want to sit behind a desk all day.
good,Great team office atmosphere and because my spouse was military the company allowed me to transfer to a Farmers office in every state of relocation. Good company.
good,"Farmers pays well has decent benefits and a good culture.  I would recommend working for this company.  Work life balance can sometimes be challenging, but in general its good."
good,You definitely have to have an outgoing personality to be successful as an insurance sales agent.. Also you must pass the insurance licensing exams for your state.

good,"Farmers Insurance was a great stepping stone for that between-college-figure-out-what's-next step. They offer many different positions and lines of business to expand into. "
good,I don't have a thick skin which is needed to work as a CSA. I wear my heart on my sleeve and it was extremely difficult to take calls and be the first person of contact after traumatic life events. I wish it would have been a better fit.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Good break rooms, good work out centers and company store benefits. Fair rules and typically a good supervisory staff. I recommend."
good,Spoke with Escrow officers and Real Estate agent on a daily basis who were helping their clients obtain Homeowners Insurance.  Presented them with a homeowners quote.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, a great opportunity to work in the community in which I live and grew up in. Meeting new people and being able to help in many complexities and capacities."
good,Farmers was the first company I worked with that the management treated me well. Very friendly and almost feels like family. Never too busy but never too bored. You get to build relationships with customers and teaches you how to socialize and network.
good,"While working as an analyst I learned a lot. I learned to inner workings of the billing system, how to research issues, where to find  answers and to create a working document for the programmers to use to correct problems.  This was a bit out of my comfort zone and I am not a technical person.  I am more of the creative type."
good,"This company is global known because of its reputation. Dependable, reliable service. They hold their Employees to a high standard, because of the high level of service they provided."
good,Farmers was an insurance company that gave me job stability but was extremely demanding. If you like to stay busy an never have an opportunity to take a second to take a break. This is the perfect job for you. We had something called a work basket and it seemed like no matter how hard I worked I could never get ahead. I am a very driven and hard working person so I couldn't understand why I always felt this way. This is a great place for anyone who doesn't mind this type of environment.
good,"Farmers Insurance Group was a great place to work- I learned a great deal about auto/property/liability insurance as well as customer service and claims service.  The workplace culture is professional and focused on results.  Hard work, multi-tasking and professionalism was the most enjoyable."

good,"Farmers has a great product line. They are very good at teaching agents the baseline elements on selling, servicing, cross-selling and how to build great relationships with your clients."
good,Working with farmers was a great company to work for. I learn that even though you pay a lot of money they will cover you. Also you meet a lot of intersting people. The hardest part was making people happy.
good,Great company to work for good benefits the CEO is top notch and my department has nice people in it that work with you not against you. The management is good my manager is great.
good,A very employee centered employer.  Keep you very well informed of new and updated information.  Recognize one another for goals met and exceeded with customers expectations.  Motivate you for advancement with education and higher learning.

good,"Typical day at work would consist of managing outbound and inbound calls with existing and future clients."
good,My experience within Farmers Insurance has for the most part been different from year to year. I have held eight positions in almost eleven years and I have learned how several different aspects of the company help support and drive organizational goals. In each position I have learned to adapt to different cultures and the exceptions of mid-level to executive leadership. I have enjoyed the drive and challenges I have experienced.

My agent paid for all three of my license."
good,"Answer underwriting questions for agents calling in, and review homes to make sure they meet AMCE guidelines and are acceptable for eligibility though farmers."
good,i learned many things workin in this office environment it was never a boring day i worked one on one with clients to recieve data that was needed
good,"entering data to produce quotes for clients, filing paperwork, handling billing issues, contacting patients for any request that thy have made on behalf of hem and the company and much more. Everyday something knew is learned either on my own or the top agent is teaching us something knew. Management is good but higher management can be low with certain issues, work hand and hand with them. Co-workers are friendly and helpful if needed. Hardest part of the job is getting exactly what the customer wants for them to stay with the company. But I enjoy the fact that company always keeps pushing the agents and gives them little pick me up to show why we should continue to do what we do."
good,"I gained more experience about working in an office environment. I got to answer phones, fax, scan documents, and other office type of tasks."

good,It's an enjoyable company to work for. Management and supervisors are good people. I would recommend them to anybody. Storm season can get hectic.
good,"It almost felt like babysitting kids but with the help of other adults. kids can pay basketball, ping pong, video games, watch movies and other things kids like to do. The team leaders were all extremely nice and made me felt welcomed everyday. the hardest part of the job was helping a specific student with his homework because he would constantly get distracted by his pencil and I would just keep having to get him back on track (which wasn't hard at all, but just often). overall, it was just a fun environment"
good,"The hours vary depending on what department you get hired into"
good,Very fun fast pace work environment. Management was always fair and  employees where welcoming and nice. This job was overall good work experience.
good,"Take incoming calls from agents and or customers and assist them with there billing and with agent correct any mistakes that they may have done to the account and adjust them. Handle more complex issues since I was Level III more in depth meaning breakdowns, One time adjustments, premium correcting. Also assisted in the internal live chat support with co-workers from other call centers, as well taking calls from them. I enjoyed working there, only issue about the management was that they start to micro manage every little thing you would do. How long you took on a call, used the bathroom, after call work, ect."
good,Call center environment. The management was very supportive and highly encouraged growth. The hardest part of the job was sitting in a cubicle all day without any windows.
good,This is a great company to work for. Company sets realistic goals for the agents and its up to the agents to strive for more.
good,"Our service is a great value for our clients. We provide high quality client satisfaction in our office.Farmers Insurance Group of Companies is the nation's third-largest Personal Lines Property and Casualty insurance group.

good,"Farmers Insurance is a good company to work at, at least the one I worked at since most of Farmers Insurance companies are individually owned."
good,"Took in-bound calls from current and prospective customers and assisted them with various facets of their policies. Compiled a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of the insurance industry and learned valuable interpersonal and inter-office skills. Greatly enjoyed the office environment. Developed meaningful and useful business relationships, as well as multiple friendships and was well liked and respected among colleagues. The most difficult part of working for such a large company was the reliance on structure and conformity. I loved the challenging environment that I faced on a daily basis, it caused me to learn to utilize my intrinsic talents in a more productive manner as well as how to implement constructive criticism and opportunities for performance enhancement."
good,"In this job I learned about different types of insurance, how they work. I became an insurance agent and this allow my to sell insurance to customers."
good,I enjoy the people that I work with. Management is very helpful. There are many fun events to participate in and we are constantly helping the community.
good,"When I was first hired, it was a private insurance company called Bristol West. It was after three years of employment that the acquisition by Farmers happened. My primary role was that of Network Engineer which was later coupled with Project Manager. I worked in the office during the day from 7:00-4:30 pm and in the evening around 9:00 pm, I would connect via VPN to oversee the Business-to-Business tunnel migrations. Moving vendor tunnels from platforms that were at End Of Life onto newer ASAs'. I was working with people from all over the country and world, including India. Another rather large effort that I partook in as Project Manager was the data center migrations. Ensuring the configurations were backed up and the application/device was tested once powered on and readdressed. This was a huge effort that usually took place over the course of a weekend, once including Thanksgiving, pulling 12-15 hour shifts, sometimes throughout the night. I feel as though I became an Engineer through these experiences and will always be thankful for my time with the company."
good,"Farmers is a work environment that was transparent, honest, and aggressive in achieving daily goals.  I had a great time learning and working beside some of the best at Farmers Insurance.  Everyday was completely different and rewarding in its own way."
good,Insurance agent position . They inculde great training and great positions . Managers help you succed no matter what situation . great environment
good,Good office working environment and flexible hours and ability to advance within the company.  Telemarketing and selling abilities are very helpful and will help get you additional income.
good,"Happy environment, helping client to be safe and insured , always fast to get back to clients and their concerns, one of the most reliable insurance companies ."
good,"This is a great place to work as an agency owner, however, be prepared to cold call.  The support you get will depend on the district that you are with."
good,I enjoyed my time as an administrative assistant and enjoyed the people that I worked with.  I continue to have a relationship with my past co-workers and clients that I met during this time.
good,Processed payments that customers made to hospitals or clinics on a daily basis.  Was able to process the payments quickly and check balances and correct error after researching the amount entered.
good,"Management was great, understanding and easy to talk to. Flexible hours with great benefits. Co-workers were very friendly and great to work with."
good,Excellent opportunity that comes with hard work and sacrific.
good,"I worked for a district manager that employed me so I didn't work directly for Farmers Insurance. "

good,Finding our own leads and closing as much new business as possible.
good,Learned a lot. 10 years experience. Good team work and collaboration.
good,Employee apprecitation days twice a year. Bonuses available.
good,"The work I did was not difficult but it was a lot of work. I liked it because I was always busy. I always had something to do and my day would fly by. I got along well with everyone thus making this place a fun environment. Unfortunately, the agent I was working for didn't offer any kind of benefits. I was hoping to find a job that offered benefits like Medical, Dental and Vision."
good,Excellent work environment for self-starters. It certainly helps to sell a very competitive product in a very competitive industry as well. A typical day at work starts early and ends when you want it to - which for me is pretty late in the day. The hardest part of the job is caring for the welfare of your clients who sometimes don't understand the ramifications of some of their life-decisions. The most enjoyable part of the job is educating my clients in the proper use of insurance and risk management. This is especially true for many of my commercial clients.
good,The job can be very stressful at times when multiple claims are scheduled and when backend work comes in.  Time management is extremely important.  The management at Farmers is amazing and they want you to be happy outside of work as well as within your job.  Everyone within the company is so nice and willing to help when needed.  They are focused on your personal development and want nothing but success for you.
good,"I was involved with handling new claims each day.  A typical day would be to make phone calls to insureds and claimants to process and settle the claim.  This also involved several hours on the computer.  I would make appointments with both parties to take statements and photos of their vehicles.  For each claim, I to determine liability by taking statements for parties involved and witnesses.  Furthermore, I would do scene investigations and pick up police reports if available.  I can't think of anything that was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable was to satisfy claimants by settling their claims in a timely manner.  It's very rewarding to see claimants happy about their car being repaired or their injury claim being settled."
good,"I'm glad I had the opportunity to work and live in the New Orleans area. New Orleans is definitely somewhere you need to visit. Put it on your bucket list. Wonderful people, interesting history and excellent food. Don't forget Bourbon Street. Best two times to visit New Orleans is Mardi Gras and Halloween."
good,"*Busy day every day but made the work day go by extremely fast."
good,"I learned so much about the insurance field as well as marketing in this position. I am now wanting to switch from the marketing side to the producing side, and working here has taught me how to market myself to be a successful producer."
good,My review is employees were trying to complete a great work goal.  I learned to grow up!  Management was trying to do their best.  Co-workers worked diligently.  Hardest part of the job was leaving.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the some of the people. I enjoyed helping the best I could.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and I'm still close to a lot of them after several years of not working for Farmers Insurance. The job is demanding and a lot of requirements to close or settle a file.  Farmers, however, at the time, provided excellent training.  You need thick skin to be an adjuster and absolutely no crying! People can get nasty and you have to keep your cool.  Farmers has excellent benefits.  Be prepared to work in a fast paced environment.  It will be a damper on your personal life if you do not know how to prioritize and balance your job."
good,"Professional Environment"

good,"Busy office, supportive employer, great co-workers and terrific clients."
good,Farmers is a fantastic company to work for. But be prepared to spend every moment you can building your business. You are in control of your time. But in order to grow and make quotas you must be willing to work late and on weekends. Great support network.
good,"I helped all agents with any kind of questions they had about Insurance. I took calls from clients about their bill, and any questions they had about their accounts. I recruited new prospects to become Farmers Insurance Agents. The co-workers were extremely wonderful, always positive, and very helpful. The hardest part of this job was trying to out do myself from the day before. My most enjoyable part of this job would be the co-workers."
good,"With my position at Farmers there is a significant amount of autonomy.  I maintain my personal inventory of claims from the settlement negotiation to final payment."
good,Nice atmosphere to work with. A good team work. Excellent environment.
good,"I love working on farms. I've done everything from working with horses, building and mending fences, cutting and bailing hay, building barns and out sheds, and can run pretty much any piece of equipment.

good,"*8 hours of work as like regular"
good,"I am an agent.  I love my coworkers, I love my location (near my home) and my income, so far if my PIF doesnt keep falling, is kinda paying the bills. My work/life balance is OK. As a new agent you work very hard and long hours. Im under the new contract with the new quotas which are difficult attain and maintain! go to www.ufaa.com to see it,..I believe its there. "
good,I was in charge to make sure that all people could get excellent benefits with the insurance. for example  farmers Insurance offers a unique package of options that can reward drivers for being accident-free. basically i was a sales associate.
good,"While working for Farmers Insurance, a typical day included handling all telephone calls, answering customer questions and assistance in policy changes. At times I found it difficult to learn all the aspects of insurance in such a short period of time, however, the management team has an excellent understanding of the importance of learning and conveniently offered all necessary tools to expand my insurance knowledge. While the office that I directly worked for maintained and a very busy work flow, teamwork is highly valued which created a comfortable and efficient work environment. All my coworkers were a pleasure to work with which made my time at Farmers most enjoyable."
good,A great place to work. Many good people. Lots of good experience. Great place overall.
good,Working at FARMERS will be an opportunity for me to experience independence in life and living for myself. Meeting new workers and serving customers needs is always a pleasure and makes you happy when you are aware that your customer exits the store satisfied.

good,Training at Farmers was phenomenal.  I really learned quite a lot while working for them and I felt important being in the field as an adjuster.  I really enjoyed my career while at Farmers.
good,"A typical day kept me very busy and occupied, which made the day go by very fast. I maintained the front desk, customers, and took phone calls. Management was very professional and nice; a person I could look up to. My co-workers were very easy to communicate with, very helpful, and understanding. The hardest part of the job was that I was not bilingual, so it was difficult to communicate with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I enjoy talking to people, and we had very friendly customers."
good,"Allways busy"
good,"Designed and Configured the WAN infrastructure, consisting of multiple T1 and T3 lines, Cisco routers, Cisco switches, Load balancers, Dell and Sun servers."

good,Customer sales and service. Collect customer payments. Assist customers in claims reporting and evaluating customers insurance needs.
good,"Insurance consulting, meeting new prospects and helping resolve issues."
good,"The sales department with 21st Century is going through some changes. The volume of calls is increasingly coming from internet leads that are transferred from a 3rd party marketing company. The customers are usually put off and agitated making the selling experience increasingly difficult. This has caused increased burnout and causes the job to feel more robotic."
good,I would go in and answer the phone calls from clients. Co-workers and management we all very willing to help each other out. This was a good work place.

good,"Helping others to see what they neeeded to ensure that they were adequatley covered, etc. with Insurance. Co-workers were energetic. Most difficult part of job was cold calling."
good,"I answered phones and directed the callers to the correct line. I would copy, scan, upload and file papers and documents on a daily basis. I enjoyed the interaction with fellow co-workers in our weekly meetings, it allowed us to know where everyone was at and what was needed from all of us as a team. The hardest part was running out of new things to learn."

good,"Very involved in the community, and the educational opportunities are endless."
good,"I worked there for 16 years, only left because I relocated to another state."
good,"Over the years at Farmers the culture changed. The changes were prompted, in large part due to Farmers' acquisition by Zurich Insurance. The company went from a very paternalistic business which promoted from within and looked after its employees by providing them with excellant benefits, job security and advancement to a company that did not. More than 50 percent of the company's management team was gone within three years after Zurich took over."
good,"Productive, fun atmosphere. Worked as a district recruiter looking for qualified candidates that were looking to start their own small business/insurance agency with Farmers Insurance Group"
good,"easy to get involved, nice people, learn as you go type atmosphere"
good,great company with a great opportunity for right individual
good,"A typical day at work began at 8:45am when I would unlock the office, turn on all lights & machines, brew coffee, and prepare for the opening at 9:00am; and ending at 6:00pm. It was a diverse office(mainly Korean), and customer challenges were a daily encounter. Manager was absent more often than not, so I would step up and perform all Supervisor duties including: enforcement/cancellations of insurance policies, ordering supplies, attending Agency training seminars, depositing company ACA daily, communicating with District Management/claims adjusters/underwriters, etc. I gained endless knowledge and training in the insurance field, and sales in general. I was soon put in charge of Agency Marketing and Communications. My co-workers and I shared a symbiotic relationship, helping each other wherever the other lacked. The hardest part of the job was the Language barrier between most our clients and our ServicePoint. Most difficult was defusing client frustration when miscommunication was encountered. But even the hardest part of the job was a learning experience, which strengthened my people skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was how each day presented new problems to be solved, each problem unique & demanding a fresh solution. I love a job that requires me to be sharp and reflective."
good,"Good place to work, excellent claims training, heavy workload."
good,"Typical day at work included deposits, withdrawals, cross-selling, opening new accounts and field marketing."
good,I began my work for this company as a Claims Service Associate and went on to obtain my personal lines claims adjusters license in many states. Having this type of licensure often allowed me to handle new and exisiting claims for auto or property losses and offer services to customers based on liability.
good,Farmers Insurance Group is a great company to work for. The management team is down to earth and friendly. The only reason why I chose to move on is because I do not like claims.
good,"Growing company with a lot of growth, on going training. Excuted marketing plans for Insurnace Agents. Executed weekly quotas, weekly interviews."
good,"Great place to work. Break rooms are great, lots of events and employee perks, great co workers"
good,"This is where I started my career path in the insurance industry after graduating from college, and I could not have asked for a better company to work for. The training is concise, with tons of opportunity for continuing education, and a very supportive management staff. The only thing I would change is that I would like to make more money and feel I am qualified to do so."
good,Excellent company. This company is very unique and values its customers.
good,"Great place to work. I worked in the office claims department so it is very focused on working and closing claims on a daily basis. It is an cubicle position that requires time management and quick thinking decision skills. The customers are contacted by phone only and are spread across nationally. You have to meet quotas in being able to move claims to completion as quickly as possible. For a candidate that is fine with these conditions, it is a fairly good paying job with much job security and opportunities."
good,Being a small business owner is a rewarding thing if you have the discipline.  You have to keep a marketing mindset everyday.  You have to think a couple of days ahead of time to find new clients.  The hardest part of the job is finding new client's.  Once you find them everything else is pretty easy.
good,"If you eventually want to have your own office, they will help you advance.  Not every customers needs are the same and they had different products for various business or personal needs."
good,Find an office where you could work in with great motivation and sales skills. Don't expect to make money the first months as an agent. Just learn and progress
good,"Worked for a Farmers Insurance Agency. Work ethics, well oriented.  Although changes in commission to agencies by corporate, compettive payout is available to ins producers."

good,The company is diverse with competitive compensation benefits. There are many career opportunities for lateral or advanced roles across several lines of business.
good,"This job was pretty fun! If you like to collab and work as a team then this is for you."
good,This location boasted video games and ping pong in the break room.  There were plenty of tasks to keep you busy all day and into next week.  If you are into volunteering they offer many opportunities and even encourage participation.  The hardest part of this job is direct contact with the insured. It will tug on your heartstrings.
good,Totally responsible for all phases of running an insurance agency. Hired and trained employees.  Sales and service of insurance products. Marketing to nearby neighborhoods to increase sales.  Meet sales goals.  Keep up continuing education for licensing. The best part of this career is the people you meet and help them understand insurance and its value.  The most difficult part was trying to make a living when there were major rate hikes on home and auto insurance products.
good,"Farmers is a large company with many departments and job options. This allows for advancement and movement, they rate you based off work quality. Good benefits. Every department is different, claims can be fast paced and demanding."
good,Was a great company to work for with great benefits and job advancement opportunities. Staff were friendly and helpful and job training was ongoing and insightful.
good,"It a good job good pay, just a long drive. Everything is timed and upper management keeps changing what they want, but that's the same with all corporations."
good,I enjoy working at Farmers and feel I have always been fairly rewarded with opportunities for development and advancement.  Advancement into upper level leadership may require a move to Los Angeles.
good,"Help insures with changes over the phones, email, person, mail, fax. Issue certificates of insurance and take payments. Follow up with the insures for any missing information regarding their polices or claims."
good,Farmers Cares about community and its employees. They make sure to maintain an excellent report with the communities they serve. The benefits are above what you’ll find elsewhere.
good,"Hours were very flexible; I was able to telecommute twice a week for 6 months. I was able to provide customers information regarding policy and regulation requirements, adjusting policy coverage and begin  the process of filing claims. The hardest part of the job is being informed of accidents, damages & loss of life/property."
good,I really liked working for Farmers. Your pay and compensation will vary by agent who sets it. Mine didn't pay as much or have compensation but others will and do.
good,Good place to work. Everything you need and want from a company. The culture here is really great. The management team is excellent. You really feel like part of the family working here.
good,Great Organization with many opportunities for advancement. Great team building strategies that brought everyone together to work harder towards the same great goal.
good,Farmers is a good company to work for in the correct location. You will need the funds available in order to get the business started and going. typical day is a lot of lead calling and customer quotes.
good,This is a good company to work for. The only concern I have is not being able to learn new programs withing the company. My manager and his supervisor were great. The paid time off was great day. It is a family culture.
good,"Enjoyed working for Farmers in various capacities for 39 years.  They were supportive of me and I responded by producing all of the products and won many awards.  I am a member of the elite Presidents Club, that composes only 1% of the farmers work force."
good,You take inbound claim calls for homeowners and automobile. The work is not hard but there are certain scripts and goals you have to be on target with.
good,"Professional Atmosphere"
good,"Expected to do a lot of work but a lot of support.  Good training, good managers to work for.  Some outdated computer systems make job a little more complicated than necessary.  Office area has kitchen, gym, coffee, good locale to go for quick shopping or lunch."
good,"I didn't have any experience in insurance and wanted to pursue a career in insurance sales. I did not have any experience in insurance or sales, which made the job a bit challenging. A task that I was up for, but was not use to pursuing clients for information and asking for their business. However, It was very rewarding when I did overcome being shy and actually won over customers and gained their trust and business. I was tasked with dealing with upset customers most of the time. Most of which I was able to win over with my ability to listen to the customer needs and set a foundation for a friendly and professional relationship. "
good,"I work for a District Manager. They are technically Independent business owners so salary, benefit, etc vary by office. Too difficult to summarize the work experience."
good,Farmers is a nice place to work. We multitask by answering phones and processing work on multiple online sites throughout the day. Management is supportive. The work can be overwhelming and the amount of information you need to know is stressful.
good,"Recently rolled out a new training program emphasizing claim ownership. This entailed knowing the claims process from beginning to end instead of having adjuster specializing in a particular area in the claims process. It is beneficial for the customer not having multiple points of contact but not for new adjusters trying to absorb the immense amount of info that you have to learn in a short period of time."
good,No way to advance in current position. Unwilling to give a raise when presented my case. Manager scoffed at me when I requested a sit down conversation to talk about my compensation.
good,Best part is being your own boss.  You can control how hard you want to work and since it is commission pay your dedication can effect your income greater.
good,"Good company to work for. It is all about managing the agents and making sure you are a resource for their sales goals. There is a huge potential for growth, as they are growing rapidly throughout the east coast."
good,Farmers has offered great benefits and has allowed me to get a hands on experience in accounting that I would not have had anywhere else. I have been able to build on my previous four years of banking experience to make me a better employee.
good,"Many people I work with enjoy their jobs and I did too for a while. The work culture and environment are great to work in. Everything is cleaned often, everyone is very nice and welcoming.The job processes and tools are constantly being updated to provide a better employee process. The only part I am not a fan of is being on the phones all day taking calls as a CSA and also how projected call volume can control your schedule so much in turn controlling parts of your life as well."
good,To be successful at Farmers one has to be very self-motivated and driven to succeed. Success doesn't come easy and for the first couple years its pretty slow going but once established its a very lucrative business.
good,"Typical day was learning insurance policy and claim procedures, interviewing potential agents, training new agents. Learned a lot about how insurance industry in general works. Loved the people, very hard working men and women. Hardest part is finding people who are willing to do what it takes to be successful in insurance sales."

good,"Working this product is a great company to refer people to, to get quotes through. Very dependable, a company of their word."
good,"Farmers Insurance is a desirable and competitive company to work for. The culture is good due to a very proactive approach to diversity/inclusion and much effort around employee engagement. The benefits and compensation are better than other large insurers in the area. There is a home office in the Los Angeles area, which is a large campus with many different departments/functions. This creates a large employee network with many opportunities for advancement and career development."
good,"I would rather not discuss about my current employer, but I to like the company. The position is just not best fit for me as a career development."
good,The manager was amazing always there for when I needed help.  He made work amazing and I always looked forward to work. Working at farmers made me understand so much about working for a million dollar company.

My manager was very helpful with anything i needed. My co-workers helped me when i got lost with something.Any struggles i was able to overcome all challenges.i enjoyed working for my manger and helping customers with anything they needed.
good,"This is the best job I have had so far. Everybody is very candid, helpful and friendly."
good,"A typical day at Farmers Insurance requires being able to interpret policy contract language and Michigan No-Fault Statute to determine if coverage applies for those injured in automobile accidents.  Sometimes claims must be investigated for potential fraud by conducting recorded statements, Examinations Under Oath, Independent Medical Examinations, contracting vendors to perform BioMechanical reviews, and composing Reservation of Rights letters.  The office has a great team atmosphere where round tables are held frequently to develop file strategies.  The best part of working at Farmer is the ability to create projects and processes and take the lead on committees for charitable activities.  The additional tasks that can be undertaken add value to the job by not limiting the scope of work to just claims handling."
good,"Was responsible for data entry of paperwork sent out, and returned in the claim process. Would process thousands of documents a day. Pare and electronic."
good,"A typical day would be going in early, and doing recovery. What I learned is that recovery is most important and making sure that stock was constantly full and helping the customer pick out stuff to match what they are buying."
good,"Very fast paced working environment. On the daily basis I would greet potential clients and they would come in already knowing which type of insurance they want. From there I would gather all the information needed from the client to generate the best quote. Since Farmers acquire Access Insurance and Bristol West in the mid-2000, I would also generate a quote through those divisions. Lastly, I would present to my supervisor the numbers. From my time at Farmers Insurance Agency, I learned a lot about customer services and the field of customer service.There would be a new task everyday but with the help of my co-workers everything was possible. The most enjoyable part was being able to solve our customer's complication."
good,Being your own boss is always nice. In this job I was able to work the hours I wanted and work as hard as I wanted.
good,Farmers Insurance has a great culture and has a way of showing their employees that they care.
good,This is commission based so you earn based on how productive you are.  Teaches you how to be hungry and work hard to earn your compensation.  Hardest part of the job is making yourself stand out so you can close the sale.
good,"On a daily basis I would answer phones, take payments from clients, as well as do home and auto quotes. It is a family run business for over 24 years. The hardest part of my job was when clients called after just have an accident or the house caught of fire and we would have to calm them down and say we will take care of everything. Lastly in January 2013 I received my license in Property and Casualty Insurance."
good,"Most days are spent answering phones, processing payments and creating lists and reports of potential clients for the insurance agent."
good,"A typical day is very easy and imformative. The things for my daily work is typical of answering phones, file, prepare for accounts payable, and accounts receivable. I learned a little more about what goes on in a insurance company and how it works. My co-workers were very informative and helpful for my needs and knowledge of the company. The hardest part of the job really is nothing cause it was more informative and exciting to learn the process of how the insurance in handling how to get people the proper insurance for what they have and how it works."
good,"It was a joy coming to work my boss and his wife are very good listners, we all communicated very well"
good,"My position at Farmers was a field auto property damage estimator.  I did not report to an office everyday, clock in or report to a supervisor in the morning so I really had to be self-motivated and organized to get my work done per standards. Even though I worked alone in my car it was a great place to work as coworkers and supervisors had a great relationship with each other and would call each other often sometimes to ask questions and sometimes just to see how your week is going. It was a very fast paced, professional job but it was very interesting to meet all of the customers and help them through getting their vehicle repaired. Most people don't go through this very often and it was a process I was very familiar with and I was able to make very easy for them. It was very satisfying for me to work with the body shops, tow companies, rental vendor, and sometimes the police department to get the claim resolved with the least complication and effort from the customer while keeping them informed. "
good,"Enjoyable environment, every day is different.  Staff is very amiable to change and a pleasure to work with on Software Roll-Outs and general policy changes."

good,You set your work schedule. Management is usually understanding if you need to modify your schedule for a day.
good,"I ran daily operations. Opened and closed the office. I am the Owner, Manager and President of my Agency, Ashley York Agency - Farmers Insurance Group. I hired and managed employees and I assign work to them. I kept high standards in my office. I organized the dress code and kept up on weekly goals for the employees to strive for. I called clients, set up appointments, and sold Auto, Home, Life, Mobile Home, Toy (4wheeler, etc…), and Workers Compensation policies. I am Illinois State licensed to sell Property, casualty, Life and Health Insurance. I personally update client files, copy file, fax. I know how an office should be run. I work as a leader and a team player. I am organized, and like to work in an organized environment. I teach people & clients the fundamentals of insurance so that they will be better educated when making their life decisions. I enjoyed my job working with the community and helping them in their time of need. I also used social media to market/advertise to the younger population. I Serviced Urbana, Champaign and a 40 mile radius. I also worked with several other companies through the Farmers Insurance Company to better serve clients who were deemed “uninsurable”, or clients who the Farmers Company saw as a liability. I take pride in knowing that I was an asset to the community."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my job at Farmers. Management encouraged teamwork, accountability, and integrity in their employees. They supported new ideas and would seek out employee feedback, and encouraged employee involvement."
good,My daily routine depends on what it is that we have booked on that given day.
good,As a contact manager I spent most of my work week contacting potential candidates to become agents. I enjoyed meeting a variety of professionals while doing this. I learned new things about the insurance industry on a daily basis. I could not have learned as much as I did without the help of both the management and the office staff. The most difficult part of my position was learning that a candidate did not pass the required background/credit check. The most enjoyable part of the position was meeting with a lot of great people throughout our region.
good,"Being able to help someone that had no knowledge of what their coverages were previously and get them properly protected based on THEIR insurance needs is such a GREAT feeling that you helped someone or several depending on the situation, priceless.... Being Bilingual and help even more prospects/future family even better feeling of great accomplishments."
good,A terrific place to work with great core values. Definitely the best working environment.
good,Help run quotes
good,During my time working here it was very easy to feel like part of the team. I had the pleasure of going door to door introducing my self to people and learning about them while trying to recrute them to come to Farmers Insurance. I would say the hardest part of my job was when I was unable to show people what a great company it was. The most enjoyable part was when someone decided that they would give my company a try and I succeeded.
good,"This is a great opportunity! To make the most of the situation you need to make sure you have to capital to hire staff and market effectively. The company is great and does all it can to help you grow and sell the products. This is definitely a career choice that you need to be ""all in"" for to make it and live and breath the idea and method."
good,"Farmers is known industry wide as having one of the best training programs in the nation. No prior knowledge of insurance is necessary as they groom you from day one and continue to provide education as you advance. The volume of the workload can be overwhelming at times, particularly around the holidays. The best part about working at Farmers is the people they hire. The morale of the office is always positive even during peak times. The attitude of the department I worked in specifically encouraged a lot of collaboration."
good,"This position has truley helped me in becoming confident in dealing with people. Farmers have allowed me to strengthen my customer service skills, phone skiils, people skills, and also being able to muti task. Farmers is a good place to work, great people to work with, and a positive atmosphere to be in."
good,I felt like supervisors gave workers good direction and support to advance.  Feel training was adequate and work life balance was good. As a claims adjuster the commercial department was great to work in.
good,"I was in 2 departments in 17 year, claims and internal audit. This is an extremely large company so there is room for advancement and location changes if you want to move."
good,"I enjoyed working for Farmers as the hours were good, pay was good and benefits were good for the area I lived in at the time. They also had a good tuition reimbursement program which I was taking advantage of. As our office decided to relocate to Grand Rapids, MI, I was laid off as I could not relocate at that time due to personal commitments. I was paid a good severance package and provide many resources for transitioning to unemployment/another job."
good,"Supervise up to 7 APD Field Claims Representative."
good,Good organization and company but increasing premiums are loosing clients.  I try my best to provide excellent service and always looking for ways to lower premiums yet still ensuring clients are properly insured.
good,Lots of traveling and well paid. The culture is a great one to build yourself up and meet new people. The best part of the job is the travel and getting to go all across the country.
good,"Shortly after I started, I was given my own office. After my production numbers were noticed, I was asked to train other callers as well as new producers the best way to cold call."
good,"A typical day at work included customer service, some administrative work, and some marketing. I learned how to navigate the Business Dashboard, how to quote potential clients, and how to take payments. Taking care of clients was a team effort for my position. There is always something to do even when there are no clients. Hardest part of the job was tedious jobs and paperwork. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting new clients, and running the marketing campaign."
good,a typical work day would consist of calling customers and taking messages. I learned how to talk comfortably with customers as well as handle any needs or questions they have and the management is very involved in the progress of each day.
good,Nice place to work but had too much politics and favoritism. Pay could have been a little better for the work load and there was limited opportunity for growth.
good,"Excellent company to work for, lots of opportunity to learn, train, and advance. Great network, great training, and lots of support."
good,"Worked for a great insurance agent. Enjoyed working with agency customers. had the opportunity of learning a variety of insurance reflated processes, writing new policy, underwriting process and claims process. Awesome work environment."
good,"Farmers is a great place to work.  Great atmosphere, great attitudes, positive feedback.  The hours are your typical call center hours, which are wonky and can impede with personal life."
good,I learned many things while working for Farmers Insurance. A typical day was spent speaking with clients and third parties. The atmosphere was very welcominmg
good,"Pay is great, hours can be long and customers can be a hassle but management is stellar and will always help you out. co-workers make the day a lot easier."
good,"typical competitive insurance sales. Farmers is a named brand for sure, a lot of competition with online companies like Geico and Progressive. I had a good book of business, but was in at wrong time after collapse of housing market."
good,"Working here gave opportunities, though those had to be pursued independently of a supervisor or manager or asked about.  The hours were generally good and having time around major holidays with family was definitely a plus.  Being a service center, at times it was overly metric driven at times and the customer experience could be sacrificed to reach metric goals.  This sometimes resulted with customers and/or agents calling in multiple times about the same issue when a little extra time on the front end would have saved time, energy, and repeat calls.  Like any service center / call center there can be some seat warmers."
good,Farmers supports work-life balance and presents opportunities to move throughout the company. It is not the most cutting edge with processes or technology but you are starting to see a shift to focus on technology.
good,The diversity of employees at Farmers is great and there is a lot of opportunity for advancement and developing a career. The work can sometimes be monotonous depending on your role but management and higher ups make employees feel appreciated and try to make work fun. There is great communication between career levels.
good,"Very face paced, back-to-back calls, great management and good working environment.   Shifts are done by shift bid, it's fairly easy to get the schedule you want. Shift trades are acceptable with approval. Excellent benefits and generous amounts of paid time off.  "
good,Working at Farmers Insurance taught me a lot tell me a lot of business adequate and how to handle negativity in a professional manner. First and only job where I file taxes under 1099.
good,This was one of my first jobs and I thrived working here. It's all about giving your best and doing what you can to make the job enjoyable. I loved the office staff and it's a great career choice.
good,"Having worked on A part time basis, as a student. The compensation was good at that time. With proper shifts management, the company always strived to achieve life/work balance."
good,The job was good. I learned a lot. That is important to me... I got to actually own my business and my book. I was able to sell it... The credit union was wonderful... I wish the rate were more competitive...
good,"A great place for graduate students. I got to learn about the banking industry. Very strong management team, friendly co-workers. Your strong effort, work ethics and commitment are definitely will be recognized here. Employee cross training is one of the best."
good,"You can learn so much and do so well with this company."
good,"After a few months working here I learned a lot about insurance like how it works and a bunch of terminologies. Working environment is great, and coworkers are nice."
good,Nice people who work at a good company. They are very kind and honest trying to help others get back in the work force. Fun place to work as well.
good,"Very welcoming work place and everyone are helpful/friendly to other. Learn about research, analysis and develop your ability to great extent. Less stressful, tasks are manageable when prioritize by real-time. Easy to do, but a lot to learn."
good,A good place to work. Make sure you are a fast learner and can be adaptive. Owner is always wanting to try new way of doing things to stay on top. It'll be a fun place to work if you can do that
good,"Farmers is a great company to work for. The agents I worked for were very professional and driven. My days were very busy answering incoming phone calls, answering insureds wide range of questions from billing questions, policy questions, claims questions, and quoting. I also performed cold calls, cross selling current customers and calling incoming internet leads. The hardest part of the job would be getting everyones needs taken care of quickly while also managing getting many quotes out to insureds and prospects quickly. I enjoy multi-tasking and working in a fast paced environment so this was fun for me. I also enjoyed the bond you get to develop with your principle agent and being a working part of making the agency grow."
good,I enjoy this opportunity because it allows me for a lot of personal and professional growth. I have expanded my knowledge of insurance and financial services exponentially. I have the opportunity to become as successful as I choose to be since this is a personally owned and operated venture under the guidance of a district manager. I have formed great relationships both with my peers and with the community. Since personal interaction is so important to me it was a great fit in many ways.
good,"I absolutely love working at Farmers, the only issue is the hours, they do not work for me and my family. The have amazing benefits, and take really good care of their workers. I could definitely see myself there for a long time, however, because of the hours I do need to look for other employment."
good,"good company...if you meet all requirements it can be a great place to work."
good,"The environment was a corporate, cubicle, setting that could get a bit mundane. Though Farmers worked hard to provide activities and incentives to boost morale. I learned how to de-escalate situations with unhappy clients, provide empathy, while keeping my production at company standards."
good,"enjoyed working in the project. i worked for a migration project, New to US, so lot to explore and lots of new friends. Working here was good."
good,i would arrive at 9 am and started checking for emails that i would need to respond back. Would make calls to see it i would give them a free quote in how to save them money.
good,Your success is up to you.  There are no limits.  The payoff can exceed your expectations.
good,"Production driver environment, the most enjoyable part of the job is they acknowledged your contributions by providing profit sharing and cash plus and spot bonus if you exceed the goals.  They also give certificate of excellence when you provide an excellent service."
good,Good company at the time to work for before they laid off customer service. Had great profit sharing benefits but clerical management lacked professionalism.
good,"-Discuss with people injured in an auto accident or at an insured’s business or home, or with people whose auto or property has been damaged"
good,"Good place to learn something useful, co-workers are pretty friendly."
good,Working for Farmers has been a great experience. I would strongly recommend it.
good,"Farmers is a good company to work for, typical days were steady influx of calls. Fun was often incorporated into each day within the constraints of the business."
good,"Creates great Insurance Agent's and Financial Service Representatives. On-going professional training in marketing and selling automotive, homeowners, life, business, and health insurance as well as financial services. Perfect sales career for the right salesman with drive and ambition to succeed in a highly competitive market."
good,Pay is ok mgmt is good the work you do is too much for the pay you get. The mgmt is very good and treats you well if you are selling. If your not then you feel the consequences.
good,Farmer's is a fun place where you can work and be yourself.  Doing things at your own pace is all you need to do as long as you can get the work done.
good,"The job its self if a grown up job. You have to be serious, quiet, egger, and always try to be positive. Without looking towards the good, you will feel trapped in an office."
good,"My job was as a Vendor Manager liaison between Zurich Insurance and Farmers.  It was a great position until they centralized all operations in the UK, and I was laid off.  I traveled to Europe several times as well as LA, where Farmers is located."
good,A fun and very productive place to eork. Loved the people I worked with as well as supervisors and management.  We all worked together as a team and everyone seemed to get along well.
good,I loved being able to make my own schedule. I loved being able to work from home. Sometimes when the demands were pouring in it was easy to get overwhelmed. Going on vacation or coming back from vacation was stressful. It does require a lot of discipline and organization to do this job.
good,I enjoy working for Farmers! There is definitely room to promote from within depending on who you work for! Farmers definitely takes care of their agents.
good,The team I worked on was very up beat and ready to work. The supervisor was friendly yet down to business. You can easily tell that everyone cares about all of their co-workers. They are also willing to train anyone as long as you put in the hours and show up.
good,Work was quite stressful with industry changes and constant rate increases that caused customers to become rude rather quickly. My boss and coworker really helped improve the job but overall you need a lot of dedication for the industry to obtain a license and earn a decent paycheck.
good,This job is very easy to do. In a typical day you quote property and casualty insurance for many different types of people. You also update and manage existing customer policies. The hardest part is customer contact especially during times of state level rate revisions. It can be difficult for customers to understand why their policy is having continued increased despite their personal history.
good,"Many opportunities and departments to work for make sure the job and hours are good or at least if you can deal with it  as it can become stressful if you get a job like me that required to be on the phones all day(which can be fun for some) nevertheless many other opportunities, and they really care about their empolyees"
good,This was a simple and easy entry level job but I found it very boring. A typical day was spent answering phones and filing client information. The supervising agent was nice and easygoing but slightly unorganized. Overall this was a fine entry level job but not something I was looking for long term.
good,Farmers is a company committed to their customers and employees. Making our customers experience the best in the industry and getting involved in our local communities are only 2 of the perks you have when working at Farmers.
good,A typical day at work is managing customers accounts and convincing prospects to receive our service. The enjoyable and hardest part is the customers.
good,"The job was to call potential new clients, maintain and sell existing clients.  Market and solicit people and businesses for life, commercial and personal lines of insurance."
good,"I've been an agent with Farmers for almost a year and a half here in Dallas, TX. Choosing to leave the corporate grind and take a huge risk starting my own business was one of the best decisions I've ever made."
good,I enjoy working here and love the people I work with. the compensation packages are unmatched in the industry.
good,"Farmer’s Insurance online web enabled integrated system, which can be accessed through Internet and intranet for Farmers underwriters and by producers for Farmers Insurance lines of business. It handles rating scenarios, reinsurance etc. The different rating scenarios will help compare strategic information such as insurance premium, limits, and loss over different policy years etc. "
good,Farmers is an excellent insurance company for which to work. I really enjoy the interaction with potential clients and helping people get something they need. Farmers understands the need to balance family and work.
good,"I will sum this up. This review is only for the original 21st Century Ins. based in CA. 21st Century Ins. Co. (based in Delaware) is no longer the original or same company in California. After a large too big to fail insurance company decided to take over the company, an economic downturn turned this profitable company downward. Even if the US economy went south in the last few years, 21st Century kept intact and not taken over, the company would be successful."
good,Customer satisfaction was the key goal
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Farmers Insurance Group of Ludington, MI. My dad started this agency 20 years ago with the idea of one day being able to pass the business along to one of his children. This is something I look forward too in the future but as for now I would like the opportunity to work in the field outside of my comfort zone and learn new management skills and learning new ways to implement strong values into the business back in Ludington."
good,"The average day for my position is pretty busy, on the phone from when I clock in until I leave (other than scheduled breaks). The calls are mostly easy but some people just dont want to listen to the right answer, they juat want to hear what they think is right. While these are the most difficukt calls they also make the day go by fast sometimes. If you think taking calls all day is something you would like then I would reccomend this job"
good,Our office was great group to work with!! Flexible hours. Great boss and great customers. We all worked as a team and was able to create a great office enviroment.
good,"Overall my experience with Farmers was fantastic. Everyone is great, they hire the best people you could know and for a good reason, the work itself is trying. You need that support from coworkers at the end of the day with the non stop phone calls and many different personalities you run into on the phones. Most customers are great but I wont lie you can get that one customers that just tears you down. Otherwise this is the best place to work and would love to go back but in a different position."
good,I spent nearly 7 years with farmers Insurance as an Agency Owner.  IN my time I met some wonderful people and learned a great deal about personal and business insurance.
good,"Typical day includes answering customer calls, supplying customers and or lenders with requested documents, as well as working one-on-one with customers in office to meet their needs, submit payments, etc. "
good,"Working at Farmers Insurance is the perfect place for the individual who likes to work independent. Once the employee has the knowledge to assist the callers, there  is a lot of freedom.  The employee has to be responsible for the tasks, do follow-ups and keep up today with new guidelines.   The hardest part of the job is advising a customer that their request is not granted, however, when we provide information in a positive way it is not that hard because the client accepts the answer. "
good,Awesome place to work. Able to work customer face to face showing the benefits of the products.
good,"Farmers Insurance has provided an excellent working environment and an opportunity to further develop my customer service skills.  The overall training, work experience, and leadership provided by Farmers are fantastic.  I am only considering additional opportunities because I feel like I have more to offer a potential employer than what is asked of me at Farmers.  A typical work day at Farmers includes working with various agents and insureds from all over the country to help manage their policies.  My supervisors and peers have all been a pleasure to work with at Farmers Insurance.  I have been able to further develop my communication, customer service, problem solving, and multitasking skills.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to interact with so many different people.  It has given me the ability to communicate with both agents and customers from all across the United States which all have different issues and needs.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to interact with my customers on a more intimate level.  I communicate with all customers over the phone.  I believe that my ability to communicate with people is better served at a more personal and intimate level."
good,Good work environment - opportunities for advancement abound
good,Great work haul wish i could have been better for this company i would have liked to grow within the company i did learn alot of new skills and techniques with this company and it got me out of my comfort zone so i kind expand my knowledge.
good,I enjoyed my time at this company and made some great friends. Sad to leave. Left because of a new oppotunity. Great company to work for.
good,Great benefits like working from home. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the file closure rate. As a field adjuster it was required to print payment and the estimate on site.
good,Farmers insurance is a great insurance. If you are wanting to work for them please do your homework first. check the reviews of each agent and their management. Rember that farmers has independent agents and each of them choose their own management. In some Farmers management will take credit for your sales. which if you don't mind others taking credit for your hard work thats fine. Just that they will take that extra bonus of money if you dont talk to your agent about it 1st.
good,"I was to answer the phone, file, data entry, and make sure payments where taken. The thing that was hard was the days that I had to be there by myself because there was no one to talk to and after a while it seemed like everything was done. I enjoyed my job then and there is nothing bad I can say about it."
good,"Management was not what I liked and how they treated clients wasn't a way in which I believed they should be treated.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients and being one on one with them. I was in charge of the office and handling all claims, clients, services, new enrollments, accounting and anything else that needed to be done."
good,"Farmers has an amazing training program and awesome compensation. However, their job culture is not desirable, no job security, and no work life balance."
good,As i worked here the pay was way to low for what i was doing. I was busy ever since the first day. All of my lunches were deducted from my pay.
good,"Very fast paced atmosphere, multitasking with hardly ever seeking assistance from the manager. We used chat mostly so I was able to receive assistance there. The workplace was great I like who I worked with except management was horrible. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone. The most enjoyable was being able to help the public and I loved my job."
good,I loved my office environment and enjoyed the people I worked with. My typical day consisted of cold calls and writing new business.I was able to make my minimum requirement of sales a month
good,"Working at Farmers Insurance was my first job out of high school. It was a temporary position; however, I acquired numerous office skills as the customer service contact manager. It was a great job and I had a great supervisor and mentor."
good,"Incoming calls for payments or questions about insurance plans."
good,"comfortable workplace, very slow.  on the job training,  Would like if it there was more work to do.  I am learning insurance quotes processing online payments"
good,The job was fine but there was no verification of appointments I set that were sold I finally just told them would work on hour without commission . I called on existing and current clients plus internet leads .
good,"Insurance is hard work with no guarantees. It is a lot of work to establish your client network, get your licenses and to  hit your goal. The Idea sounds simple but  there is a reason everyone's not a millionaire it a lot of work with no pay in the beginning with the hope that you make money to pay the bills and will start to become  established. Its a lot of work with no guarantees."
good,"Farmers was a great place. Interacting with customers are a blast. The only discouraging part is calling complete strangers and begging them to buy farmers way over priced products. farmers does not know how to appeal to its customers, which inturn makes your job alot harder and almost IMPOSSIBLE to say the least."
good,Farmers Credit Union did not have any room for advancement.
good,Good customer service skills learnt hoe to stocktake items meet new people loved everything about this job the hardest part was showing others that didnt listern or watch what we had been told to do.
good,Great place to work at though it's part time and the hours and pay wasn't enough the owner is a great guy to work with friendly and patient he would explain every thing clearly.
good,Insurance is boring not my choice of career ive always wanted to work in the legal field  I love my co workers but it was not the industry for me.  Insurance is boring
good,"Great CEO, fast growing in insurance industry, OK management and huge support in keeping up with technology.  Company provided benefits did not meet industry expectation."
good,This industry has given me so much experience and knowledge. I have learned how to work with a diverse group of people. The experience has been great. The most rewarding of this job has been to help people understand the importance of insurance and what role it plays in our lives.  Many people see it as wasted money because they are not seeing the return of their dollar upon paying premiums.........unless there is a claim. So thankful for all the experience I have gained.

Although the space was quite small due to the number of people, the atmosphere was great! The two women I worked with were always happy to talk to clients and during my time there, I never heard a complaint. A typical day consisted of checking & sending any and all mail, black-boxing unneeded clientele files, transferring data from paper documents to digital format, and providing anything else my boss needed from me. It is quite difficult for me to speak upon management. My boss was not ""the"" boss, and the woman who was ""the"" boss was not around much, but any time she was, she was the nicest person in the room. The hardest part of the job was answering telephone calls. That was never a part of my job until later on, so it was something to adjust to. This being my first job, my social skills were not all that great, so answering phone calls and having to speak to clients was kind of nerve-wrecking. Second hardest part of the job was writing and sending cards. Where I was employed, customer satisfaction was key, and they were constantly sending out ""thank you"" cards to those who have been loyal to the company. Aside from the ""thank you"" cards, I also sent birthday cards to clients who had birthdays approaching. That was not the hard part though, the hard part did not come until the holidays came around. During that time, most of my other work was pushed aside because each and every client on their roster got holiday cards, so every day my shifts consisted"

The hardest part of the job was when I was alone and had every phone ringing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the manager didn't care if I was on my phone or on social media when nobody was in the office."

The company could not care less about their employees and just want that ""premium"" however they can get it, which means that the agents that are ""recognized"" for growing business are often those who deal dishonestly with customers and other agents. Anyway, it's a pretty good job."

While I had a lot of experience in cold calling AND that I was already licensed in P&C, I found the cold calling to be the most difficult. While I had the requisite experience, 90-100 calls any hour is tough, and then having to transfer to another agent was alos tough due to lack of commission."
good,"Worked there for just over a year. The hours are decent, depending on department. Pay fluctuates greatly depending on education and advancement. Pretty laid back when it comes to having to do your job."
good,"Farmers is a great company! Very busy and fast paced. Great people, but hard to advance.  I love the flexibility I have with the ability to make my own schedule."
good,I love Farmers and I love my boss/agent but it's a new company and he can't afford to put me on full-time at this time but said he would if he could. He told me that I am the most consistent prompt person that he's ever worked with.
good,"I was employed in the CSA department at one of the Help Points. I can only speak to my experience in that particular department.  Team work was cultivate to the extreme.  Some people have college friends...I have Farmer's friends.  We worked together like a family. "
good,"This job was a joke. The owner never wanted to be in the office, and only ever cared about going golfing or going skiing. It's an insurance company but they don't provide you with basic health care... ok."
good,"I loved working there, and working hands on with Farmers agents. Unfortunately my position as a whole was terminated in the state of Tennessee. I would gladly recommend this company to anyone."
good,"I enjoy working with the company. My boss a such an awesome person. Very understanding and flexible with my schedule. Work can sometimes be overwhelming despite, nothing I cannot handle."
good,"Great place to work if you know what you want to do, and where you want to go. Options are limitless, never-ending amount of events you can relate to insurance marketing."
good,"A typical day at work requires taking phone calls, helping clients, and collecting information for quotes. I learned the system that Farmers uses for their insurance information and how they calculate quotes. The management was great and relaxed. The culture is very laid back. The hardest part of the job was first learning the system, but once you got used to it, it wasn't bad at all. What I enjoyed about this job is that it was pretty quiet during the hours I worked. I was part time and it worked out great."
good,"Worked as an Casualty Administrative Support Processor, loved the job and the people.  I loved that company gave to March of dimes and we had loads of team building activities."
good,"Cold calling, for retention of Insurance. Marketing is something I like I do Quotes for Home Auto and Life insurance. Home Inspections on new business and refinancing. Take claims for clients. Over all a good place to work if you don't mind working for Commission."
good,"I have worked at the company for about 12 years, and I do enjoy going to my job everyday.  The management team wants to see their employees succeed."
good,"Staff realize the mandatory and severity of finding work"
good,good start to a career path that will pay good as long as you put in your time. Requires long days of marketing and really teaching clients about insurance and financial service
good,"I had a great work environment. My supervisors were great and turned into great friends. I had lots of responsibilities, I always over achieved on all my continues education."
good,"I like working with Farmers, the company is great. But I am not making as much as I would like to be even after getting Life/Health/Accident licensed. Wages are decided by each individual agent."
good,"a typical day at work for me would consist of making over 200 phone calls in a 4 hr period trying to get insurance leads for the company. Working at this company taught me great telephone communication skills as well as how to send a fax,make credit card payments and how to act and work in a professional work place. I have great co workers who are willing to help or provide assistance if needed and are also very friendly,the agent I work for  is very compassionate about his company as well as his employees he does what he can to help when he can and is willing to work with his employees. Marketing for me is both frustrating and rewarding by that I mean it can be frustrating if you call all afternoon and give it 100% and at the end of the day don't have much to show for it,makes me feel like I didn't do my job,on the other hand when I do provide a lead for my company I am very proud and hopeful that we can turn that lead into a potential customer and if that happens I feel as tho I have succeeded,and if even in a small way,helped the company to grow. Marketing can be difficult specially now days with all the scams that go on, concluding that the hardest part of my job is trying to convince the person on the other end to believe I really do work for a company and am not just wanting their personal information."
good,There are so many people who really have no idea about the actual insurance coverage they have and being able to teach them about insurance is very fulfilling. I am currently looking for something new due to the fact that agency is expanding but there are no guidelines for new responsibilities and at times office can get quite hectic. The only thing that keeps me going and actually makes the day a lot more enjoyable would have to be the personal relationships I have been able to have with my customers and the sense of security I give them with every question I answer. More teamwork is definitely needed. I hope to be able to find a work place where we can go above and beyond for our customers while keeping a strong office structure while working as a team.

good,Very Professional Company. I would Market daily
good,"When I get to work, the first thing I would do is have my morning meeting with my boss. We would go over the messages he had and go over our daily plan. Daily I would speak with customers, take payments for their policies, talk with mortgage companies over the phone, help customers file claims. write quotes and sell policies. I have learned most of my office experience here at Farmers. My manager was the best teacher and very easy going. The hardest part of my job was having to hear the sad stories my customers would tell about the car accidents they had just been in or the claims they would need to file for their home because of the weather. It always upset me that they were going thru a hard time but it was enjoyable because I was able to help them thru it and come out of the negative with a positive."
good,The ability to connect with people on a personal level allows for the company to thrive and flourish. Farmers Insurance is all about establishing a long term relationship.
good,Farmers is a solid company with reliable products/services and a firm agency model.  You must love people and problem solving to work in  an insurance agency.  Each agent runs their franchise differently so the ability to wear many hats is important - and makes you a more valuable member of their family.
good,"A typical day at Farmers world is answer those phone calls, incoming emails and faxes. Assist the insureds with their questions on their current policies and/or submit their payments and help file a claim if needed."

good,"I pride myself on stong people skills and found the work hours too restrictive. I like to be 'front of house', assisting customers in the office and on the phone.  Home visits were also a favorite use of customer relations. "
good,"Farmers corporate management does a good job of trying to keep local agencies happy. New York state is new for Farmers so they seem to be out of touch with underwriting and rate comparisons which makes it difficult to maintain a positive work environment. Hardest part of the job is developing leads , best part is the pride and ownership in your business."
good,"fast paced, great employees, customer service training great, training is long, co workers work well together, sometimes had to handle more tables than expected, long hours, and sometimes worked during holidays with no request offs"
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers, working with the Claims Adjusters and others in the claims office. I worked varies jobs over the years of employed. Please inquire within."
good,"It has been three years. I am grateful that I was able to have the opportunity to work with this agent. He is a great boss. I've learned many things from him regarding how Insurance works. Although it's a big company the agents are individually owners. So this allows every agency to be different. In my opinion, He does a great job. We truly care about our customers and will go out of our way to help those in need."
good,"I currently work for Farmers Insurance, it is a very ethical company with great employees. I would recommend the sales agent position to anyone with great sales ability and looking for a long term career."
good,"Began telemarketing work co-calls from list of potential clients at 4:00pm "
good,"My typical day at work consists of calling and e-mailing potential clients. I also gather the information the Farmers Agent needs to write up a quote. My job is to let people know what Farmers is about and why they should switch over. The hardest part of my job is getting the ""No's"". The most enjoyable part is when our clients thank me and let us know how greatful they are to have us there for them."
good,Loved working here. They had other fun stuff to participate besides just work. 
good,"- We got some coffee to start off the morning, reviewed what files needed to be done for that specific day and worked the files."

good,"As an insurance agent with Famers Insurance Group, a typical work day has a slow quiet pace. The mojority of clientel that Farmers Insurance Group strives to keep prefer electric policies with auto draft payments. Direct face to face communiations with clients are rare."
good,Fun Place to work and great customer interaction.  Owners are very nice to work for and you can make more then your hourly wage if you are good in sales.
good,I've worked for this particular agent since June 2009 but left for a year at the end of 2012 through the end of 2013 unfortunately the agent has lost interest in the business.
good,A typical day at Farmers Insurance is doing cold calls and helping customers with their concerns. There are the occasional events that we have to attend such as River Men games and Cars and Coffee.
good,"I actually based my rating on my time at Farmers Insurance as a Full time employee(account executive) , as well as my most recent time as a contractor.  I most enjoyed mentoring employees.  I was part of the Emerging Leaders Program and continued to mentor some people after my retirement in 2015.  While the culture was work/life balance importance, many times I worked long hours including weekends.  However, being part of an IT organization, this work ethic comes with the position."

good,"I worked for someone within Farmers. Overall there were great training from headquarters and I would receive extra training from up lines if I so desired. The training helped me to have a better understanding of the company, what they stood for, why they believed in their products, how to properly manage the products for clients and how to sell the products to them.  I learned about their various life products, CoveredCA, how to set up auto quotes and about various cultures in Africa as many of the clients I worked with were from Sudan and Eritrea. I realized in working for Farmers that each office will have different people that tend to go there, so depending on who you work for in Farmers will likely determine the culture you learn more about and represent. I enjoyed my job overall as it was a very friendly environment and I got to learn many skill sets, as well as, the company itself was great to work for. While I liked who I was specifically employed by, there was often a lack of communication and I often felt like his secretary rather than a hired sales individual, which is what I was actually supposed to be there for."
good,I learned a lot my boss is amazing but I feel I do to much for what I am getting paid. I have learned a lot in this passed year. I have sealed with all types of people and claims. Also I loved that the boss believed that I could do things on my own and she confided in me. She is very knowledgeable and knows what she is doing and she has fought me well. If I would get a raise I would stay there

The district managers help you start up your agency systems while providing coaching and development. The most enjoyable part of the agency development program is developing a niche and the hardest part of dealing with the program is the bureaucracy from corporate.

good,I absolutely loved my job but the commute was to far and two of us working on different sides of San Antonio was difficult. This wonderful work place with the best and understanding manager was a opportunity that I wish I wouldn't had to let go. Left on great terms.
good,"I learned all my work habits at Farmers Insurance. I would take all the phone calls, check rates, file paperwork, and assist all the agents. Working with my father was a great opportunity. He taught me all the ins and outs of the business."
good,"The day would usually start anywhere from 9am to 11am, depending on when my supervisor would need me in the office. Typically, I would open up my laptop and start quoting and pick up the phone to start calling prospective clients. On Fridays my supervisor and I would go over well constructed marketing plans and think of new ways to attract business. "
good,"You will need to have previous insurance sales experience to facilitate your progress and become an agent."
good,The prospect of being your own business owner is a strong draw but when it comes to putting food on the table.  The lure was there having worked in the Army for so long and the desire to own my own business made me want to explore the idea of being an insurance agent.
good,I first started off working in the Farmers main call center in Simi Valley. I took calls from the agents regarding problems and questions they were having with there policy holders accounts. This place closed down and I found a job working in an actual agents office. It was just a 3 person office. The agent was never in the office so I took on his responsibility in running the office and also did all the customer service. This taught me that I enjoy working in a large office with a lot of people AND also in a small office working independently.
good,Farmers was a great employee friendly company until the outsourcing. Farmers is a Insurance company that had great productivity before outsourcing. Great employees.
good,"pick the phone"
good,"My manager taught me things about the business. He took time out to work with me."
good,"Very good environment to work in. They trusted their employees to be responsible and self-motivated. The people were friendly and helpful, as well as the management were there to assist you whenever you had a question. The hardest part was that it was a short time assignment. The mailroom department was transferred to another State. I would have very much liked to have stayed there, but even the Supervisors were either transferred to the new location or laid off."

I have the opportunity of working with a well-rounded group of people that holds high morals and values in the work we do for our clients each week.  There is nothing hard about what I do in my work; it is the excitement and joy of seeing our client’s accelerate in their insurance knowledge base.  I however, wish there were better benefits within the business and a more stable production of income."
good,"As a calling manager at Farmers Insurance, it was my job to cold call perspective clients and schedule appointments for quotes to receive insurance. I was able to work from home on my laptop and cellphone along with out networking through social media or meeting people."
good,"A normal day consists of me making and receiving phone calls, enter data into the simons data base and to increase our clients and sales. I don't really have a hard part because I enjoy my work. Best part would be the fun of talking to new people and sharing about our company and gaining revenue."
good,"I learned a lot thru the insurance industry about auto, home and life insurance which is great for me in my everyday life because I now have the knowledge about insurance and can use this knowledge when selecting my own coverage or when a friend or family member has an insurance question I might be able to help answer for them."
good,"Typical day at work consists of cold calling leads that one needs to find on their own, continues onto calling customers for late payments. Friendly staff."
good,Working for a Farmer's Agent has been an enjoyable experience. A typical day consists of many phone calls and conversations assisting clients in need. This requires problem solving and organizational skills in order to help clients and the Agent.

good,A typical work day was slow and easy. I learned many new skills through cooperative teaching from my coworkers and manager.

My favorite part of my day was when clients came  in because they had questions and left the office happy because I resolved there questions. I would say the hardest party of that job was when we ran into a issue with a client, the process of getting it taken care of. The management was supportive and helpful, and I learned a lot in just two months."
good,I found the insurance products available had premiums in excess of the standard appetite for most industries which made them hard to close in competitive situations.

I now manage the office and employees.  For the most part it is a very routine job but there is so much to be done in a day that the multi-tasking is fun.
good,I enjoyed going to work monday - friday and having weekends to take care family in need. I enjoyed learning from each co- worker. I like that i was constantly on the go running errands.
good,"The majority of the time, I paid glass claims for insured customers.  This included all glass on an automobile.  This included filing some property and auto claims.  The management was wonderful about teaching and training was a priority.  There was a lot of feedback, which makes it easy to adjust work performance.  My co-workers were very pleasant.  There was quite a bit of socialization within the teams.  The hardest part of the job was working late hours (if you had no seniority).  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  The customers made it possible to have a very versatile day."
good,"A typical day at work can be very busy at times.  I have learned to manage my time, become an expert in customer service and adhere to schedule.  I have great co-workers and managers that really care how well I do.  They make sure I have the skills needed to succeed.  The hardest part of the job is job security.  Reviews are 50% in hands of customers who are not always fair about their surveys.  There are also many changes that happen weekly and it's hard to keep up with new procedures.  What I enjoy the most is being able to help the customer and make the process as easy as possible for them.  I enjoy being able to resolve any issues they have and answer their questions."
good,This was my first job and I really enjoyed being around a lot of people. There were new people everyday and the repeat customers of course were awesome. The company was a great place to work but the managers were not very good.
good,"We offer all lines of insurance and customer support.  We have two agents in the office, myself and a file clerk.  The environment is fun, enjoyable and a welcoming place to do business as well as be employed.  My duties vary everyday.  Whether it's filing a claim, selling insurance or answering the phone the customer is the top priority."
good,"I learn about insurance auto, life, home. also interact with clients and be able to help them .  it gave me a better prospective on life protection."
good,Friendly training staff and atmosphere. Hard to start off as an agent right out of college. Their training program is missing some main pieces to make it manageable to move to the next tier in the company. Found it hard to make money after I had invested a lot of time and money in the company with lack of connections or training. Would recommend company to a well established business professional.
good,"Farmers claims is a great place to work for variety in the day and continually new situations to adapt to and figure out.  There is good interaction with customers and considerable flexibility with the work day and appointments for claims.  Claims representatives have the ability to treat their job as their own business to manage to produce the results they want.  The hardest part of the job is the unpredictable nature of claims.  Some weeks will require 40 hours of work and the next 60 or more based on volume, staffing and the needs of the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with customers and the opportunity to have a positive impact on what is normally a difficult and sometimes stressful experience of having damage to their home.  I have learned how to be flexible, manage my time, and to adapt to change readily."
good,Farmers was a large stepping stone and very knowledge learning job. The hours were long at times but the environment was a good one.
good,Love the fact that Farmers had tuition assistance.  Great bunch of people that work for this company and the management treats you like family.
good,"Small office of 3 agents and part time assistant. Typical day at work includes insurance quoting, managing client files, policy processing."
good,Everyone should at least think about working for Farmers. It is a wonderful place to work.
good,"very good company ,you develop an excellent rapport with clients,but it takes a while to grow with company."
good,"A job looked forward to going to."
good,"I work a great shift 7-2:30 M-F, I work on Auto cancellations, Endorsements, verify proof of prior insurance. I also work on miscellaneous reports as part of my day to day process. I love my co-workers we are like family, and always make it a point to do something fun in our team meetings as group activities."
good,"Farmers overall is a GREAT place to work!  They provide great benefits including contributing to a 401k and very fair/competitive vacation packages.  The workload is high right now, which in turn brings morale down a little bit.  It is something that is constantly being reviewed and efforts to make it better are always in the works.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help others and make a difference in the claims process."
good,"The first thing I do in the morning is check the voicemail and email, then I prioritize my activities for the day."
good,"•Quoted, wrote and serviced new and current business for auto, home, life and commercial insurance."
good,"I had one of the hoghest in insurance sales in the District, love working with people"
good,I didn't like the idea of the agent I worked for never being in the office. I basically trained myself on what I learned by the online sites.
good,A typical day at work is answering phones doing your daily job.
good,I was usually the only one in the District Office most of the time as my Manager and other co-workers worked out in the field.  I took take of all daily activities and reports.  I assisted Agents and Customers as needed.  My office was cheerful and comfortable.  I enjoyed what I did.
good,"A typical day at the office was to takes calls,answer messages and file papers. My co-workers have been my favorite to dats. The most enjoyable part of the job was its small built allowing me to get close the the customers. "
good,• Developed an understanding the project specs and system architecture.
good,having very good exp with mainframe and cobol..i have been working with last 3 years i have exp with following
good,"I worked for an agent managing his book of business. I would help his clients with anything they needed. Making changes to their policies, help make payment plans, make sure their needs were met. I would also order supplies, plan meetings and cross sell to our current clients."
good,I worked at Farmers for about four years. The people that I worked with were like my family. The cons about working for Farmers was that there very limited opportunity to get a vertical promotion.
good,Based on my work experience I can say I enjoyed the time I was able to provide my skills. The people were fun to work with and the work pace was great.
good,a typical day at work:pretty good
good,Co-works are caring and family orientated people. Management supported and encouraged self-growth and development of education. The difficulty in the department was the measures used to rate the jobs performance; on a scale base! The people are amazing they are truly a second family to you.
good,"I really enjoyed my days with Farmers Insurance. The friendly staff made the days seem to just float by. Management always made it a point to attend staff lunches at least once a week which was very nice. The daily task that where assigned to me by far the most enjoyable part of my day. When you like what you do, it really makes things simple. The hardest part of my job was when I was told the office was closing."
good,"The agent is amazing, very nice and always willing to work with you"
good,"A typical days work at Farmers Insurance, was greeting clients and compiling information. I would answer phone calls and take messages if the agent was not in. Also, i would fax, copy, and file paperwork. Most of the information was in a filing system or on the computer. I learned how to be organized and patient. The hardest part of the job was making time pass, when it got slow. The most enjoyable part was beig able to do what i do best, which is clerical work."
good,"I worked for Farmers Insurance for 40 years and found the company to be a consistent company to work for. I received my pay on time, yearly bonus on time. All benefits were great with exception that the medical coverage was lacking. The company was concerned about their employees and still needed to maintain the production and quality our customers expected. Co-workers were good and our team was a mixture tenure of experience giving me a great team because we all had a point of view with blended together worked GREAT! My supervisors were good to work for and respected me for the job I did and I them for their performance and communication skills. Hardest part of the job was ramp up of the dept in 2000 and the virgin programs and equipment we had that were meeting bare necessity and the struggle daily to see that my team got the enhancements needed to perform their duties in a timely and accurate manner. We had a production environment and I tried to do whatever necessary to see that I was not expecting things from my team they could not possible give me without the enhancements. Enjoyable part of job was the people and the challenge daily. It was not boring or dreaded. I got up every morning ready to go to work and was never late or tardy and the day flew by."
good,This was by far my favorite job. The owner is great and the job was fun. I learned how to write insurance policies and enter payments in the computer. Also I enjoyed that my co worker was an awesome person. She taught me everything I learned while I was there.
good,Good company. Learned alot about auto insurance. Supervised a small group. Co workers were easy to work with. Hardest part of job was getting every claimant handled when they thought we should. Most enjoyable part was customer satisfaction
good,"Company was really great and so was mgmt, I was part time needed Full-time so have nothing negative to say. Mgmt was always their if you had questions."
good,"Great place to work. I was able to transfer from Michigan to Arizona and advance my position in the company. Phone calls were stressful, but otherwise a great environment."
good,I was the go to woman while I worked there. I was sent to different offices who's agent grade needed to be brought up. I loved doing that. I brought 4 agent grades up while working for this company.
good,Lot of hard work day in day out outside I liked it a lot the deference experiences I have had in skills like welding Plumbing fence work heavy equipment experiences
good,"It's a company with a friendly and very cooperative work environment in all levels of management, always ready to support all members of the team. Continue Training & Education is a core value for this company. Excellent work culture."
good,"Farmers insurance was my first job and taught me many skills that have carried over into my life. Starting from filing papers every day to becoming the head office worker showed me that working hard equals moving up the ladder. At one point in time, I was responsible for calling each and every customer that had missed a payment. As you can already assume, many customers were very angry about a missed payment due to miscommunication or other. This is what really started my excellent people person skills, being able to satisfy the customer and calm them down became a daily task."
good,This job was fantastic but a new manager was brought on that is a real micromanager and the complexity of the job has been steadily increasing yet quotas remain the same.
good,"log into a phone and start taking customer's call with two schedule 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break each day. the hardest part of the job is taking a call from a customer who didn't have the money to pay the premium for the insurance, and was about to be cancelled. the most enjoyable part was when a customer though the premium was too high, and when I was done going over all the coverage and then having the customer ask for more coverage that increase the the over all premium, or when a upset customer was able to get a better idea of what the policy would do and how it is set up to pay. the customer comes around and says no one has ever explain that to me before!."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Farmers. The SIMS program was a great tool, and I was happy when it rolled out. Everything was handled quickly and efficiently be that with claims or service calls."
good,"The location I was in was the district office on Cave Creek in Phoenix. I had the most wonderful manager and the atmosphere was to die for! All of the other employees were just fantastic and it truly was like a tight knit family scenario. Although I feel that the compensation could have been better for the type of work I was performing, I was glad to stay regardless because of the flexible schedule and hours for my school. The best part of the job was helping other people get jobs and achieve dreams of owning their own businesses. The hardest part was making phone calls all day long with minimal break time."
good,"Everyday comes with something new dealing with customers. That s the fun of it."
good,"Farmers is a great company, but there isn't much room for growth. Our department is very understaffed. They pull people off the phones for other tasks which in-turn makes for heavier call volume."
good,"I had lost my job at Allstate and the owner of the Farmer's Agency recruited me due to my exceptional Sales experience.  I have been working there for only 3 months,"
good,Farmers was in a transition during the time of my employment. There were many layoffs due to this transition and business was extremely slow. I felt the company compensated their employees fairly
good,"Good Company, "
good,"The company itself is wonderful. Unfortunately, I had a poor supervisor in my opinion. Overall, the management is not all bad. The company really does take care of their employees."
good,"I loved working for Farmers. Typical work day consisted of outbound calls to clients, processing payment, and completing changes. I learned how to work in QuickBooks as well everyday insurance duties. The agent I worked for was very family oriented and down to earth. Farmers is a very stress free environment."
good,I enjoyed working at Farmers Insurance Group. I progressed from a Service Associate to a Senior Service Associate and eventually to a Underwriter in the 8 years that I was there.
good,"I advanced quickly there but you had to agree to move anywhere to enter the management program which I could not."
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phones, taking payments, filing paperwork, cleaning office, closing out ACA drawers, making bank deposit, picking up mail, and closing office."
good,"I worked for Farmers Insurance for 12 years. Farmers is a good company to work overall, and I would recommend this company as an employer for anyone seeking advancement, especially if they are willing to relocate."
good,"This job is professional, and for the most part they trust their employees.  They pay a little more than most other insurance companies.  Because the job is comfortable, though, people don't leave it very often and promotions usually take several (5+) years, IF you are a top performer.  The company is also LOSING customers, so it is shrinking.  This needs to change quickly.  Their strategy of having agents and then a very confusing acquisition structure means that many people are skimming money off the top, which means rates have to be higher in order to pay everyone who has their fingers in the pie.  "
good,Paid training and fun inspiration environment! I wish my family didn't have to more so I could have advanced my career there. They welcome you and become like family!
good,I enjoyed working for Farmers we were like a family I really liked the management. It was a great company to work for with great benefits very nice people we had a lot of company celebrations which I feel helped us to work better as a team
good,"Hard work, great environment, computer based mostly, customers that call are the worst... it is hard to move up unless you have the four year degree. .."
good,Great company with great values. Wonderful benefits. Great culture. You can/will definitely make long lasting friends. Extensive and thorough training. Work/life balance can be challenged if you want to be successful.
good,"Its a great opportunity for anyone interested in being your own boss. "
good,"Progressive and trailblazing company with innovative ideas, products;  and hardworking employees. I strongly recommend anyone with their P&C or Life licenses that who is looking to start their own business and need help with funding such, to consider working for Farmers."
good,The job was very nice. I answered phone calls and ran quotes. I sent out insurance bills and called customers that were late on payments. The team that I worked with was very lovely and always willing to help when I had a problem.
good,"There were days very slow, but when it was busy it was a non stop phone ringing, emails, a faxes. We were super busy on summer days for some reason people will be buying a lot of houses and they needed to be insured."
good,"I work at Winton-Ireland.  Farmers Insurance was my previous employer years ago.  They closed."
good,I enjoyed working for myself however having your own insurance agency your income fluctuates and for me as a new agent was not enough to take care of my grandmother and I.
good,"I loved the office that I worked in for Farners, I was able to work my schedule that fit my family and personal needs. Weekly goals were discussed and rewarded when achieved!"
good,I loved my job with Farmers. I favorite part of the job was having people leave the office with a smile on their face. There are times when this doesn't happen but you just have to get over it and move on to the next customer.
good,great place to work if you brown nose management or party on a regular owners are awesome coworkers do more yacking instead of there jobs and causes irrate customers
good,"Great company to work for, lots of tools for training, room for advancement. If you like insurance sales you'd do great. Everyone I've met is super professional."
good,"Farmers offers great opportunities to all its employees. In the claims department in liability, the job is just very stressful and you have many cases that you are responsible for. Needless to say the work/life balance isn't incredible because even though you leave the office you still go back the next day and consistently feel behind."
good,"Great and loyal company to work for. Great incentives and loved the friendly competition, but didn't feel like I got paid for the amount of time I put in."
good,"Being self-employed is a great perk, if you have a side job that pays you really well.  The cost of being self-employed is greater than any benefit.  I can't afford this job."
good,"Awesome company to work. Fun,& family friendly environment. Employees are really treated well. Benefits and bonuses were excellent and salary highly competitive."
good,"It has been 10 years since I worked at Farmers but would recommend the company to anyone."
good,"Same as  previous, except I was also her administrative assistant"
good,"Benefits, Schedule Flexibility, Pay is decent and usually get a bonus every year if the company does well. They also provide on the job training. ****"
good,"Transcribed medical claims, file, issue claims and telephone operator in the evening. Learn how claims were done.  Managed different jobs like transcription, filing issue out claims and answered the phones.  Work place culture was very nice and friendly.  Hardest part was just answer multiple phone lines.  Most enjoyable was working together with my associates as a team."
good,"Flexible work hours, work from home two days a week. You have to be a team player and you have to be okay with change. Free gym. Starbucks on site. Beautiful location with outside eating areas, walking trails, water features etc."
good,"I loved working here, great people. Was a work at your own pace type of job as long as you met time lines. Unfortunately my family needs more compensation  then this job can offer."
good,Farmers is an excellent and ethical company when it comes to how they care for their customers for a COVERED PERIL. I see some complaints when consumers don't understand how insurance works. But when a customer DOES have a covered claim -- I am proud to work here and know that our customers are well taken care of.
good,"I am trained and competent insurance professional, with many years of experience providing insurance policies for special events, home, auto, commercial/general liability, farm/crop, flood, earthquake, bond, boats, and motorcycle. Helped client evaluate and obtain personal and business policies and collected client monthly payment and delivered to bank."
good,Farmers offers a great management team and an excellent work life balance. Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to work towards business ownership.
good,"Answering phones, scheduling appointments, taking payments, filing correspondence. "
good,"Great place to work for, lots of flexibility and they are very trusting. Management was awesome. If they paid more I could see myself staying there for a long time."
good,"This company is great for your professional and personal lifestyles. They have somewhat of a ""college"" atmosphere and everyone tries to help you succeed for the most part."
good,"Good income potential! Challenging, but exciting position! Good training and great employees throughout the company! Good incentives to work hard and be rewarded!"
good,"I answered phones in the beginning while finishing High School.  As I learned the insurance industry, my duties were increased to include policy changes and processing."
good,"I worked with two of the most caring people I have ever met. They make sure you feel like family and are always very understanding of days you need off. Working here, I built a lot of skills that will help me so much in the future."
good,My entire day at work is sitting in front of two computers as I email agents and make changes to policies as requested. Management seems to be removed from the daily goings-on of the people doing all the work. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the technology and not feeling adequately trained; and the most enjoyable part is knowing how chill everyone is.
good,"I took the position to act as an accountant for the agency. I was asked to apply for my license, which I did, and passed. I didn't sell, "
good,Engaged and responsible work force.  Culture of asking questions to help push the department/company forward thinking of new ways to do things.  Leadership looking to develop talented employees to reach new heights both professionally as well as personally.
good,Working as a marketing assistant I was making many phone calls a day to gather info. Management was great and training was good. Don't be surprised to talk to people who do not want to talk to you. Instead learn how to respond to them effectively and be patient and assertive.
good,Farmers insurance is a good place to work. Great people to work with and management has done things to make the teams cohesive. I enjoyed working there.
good,It is an opportunity to be a small business owner. Days are long; but you have the daily opportunity to interact with various people. District Managers are fantastic and help you grow your business. Other agents are also always around to help you when you have questions.
good,My experience was really good in this company. I have learned a lot of things other than work and enjoy each moment.
good,"The management team is awesome. They're all very caring, and really listen when you have stuff going on. They understand that employees have a personal life, and that life is not all about work all the time."
good,"Great company overall, liked the direction of the CEO, however, I would recommend only working for the corporate office."
good,"I was hired as a marketing intern however, I was used more as a commercial insurance intern. This internship was more of a learning and less of a hands on, but I think that is because of the time period I spent with the agent."
good,"This job was really fun to work for, the employees were great and very helpful. The management helped out when ever you had a problem you had trouble solving alone."
good,Excellent training provided for each position. Lots of entry level positions with great yearly income and benefits. I recommend this company to anyone who is interested.
good,"I grew with the office from just me to"
good,"I  greet visitors, answer telephones, make bank deposits."
good,"Wonderful management very easy to work for and with, great learning experience. Different day to day job duties. Learning the ends and outs of insurance was a new experience and I was grateful for the opportunity."
good,I work at 5 o'clock and get out my list of people to call in the area to talk about what insurance they have and what farmers could do for them if their insurance didn't cover it.
good,This job offered me a lot of autonomy and gave me the ability to learn some new things.  I liked the work and the people I worked with.  It was a fund environment and productive.
good,Daily interaction with team members and different lines of business all working together to provide the best customer service experience.
good,Great work environment. Easy and quite. Great company. Typical day at work is processing payments and claims. Calling back on quotes and prospect.
good,"This is a good place to work. You can lear a lot from the management. Can be difficult to get along with other staff at times, but overall a good place."
good,"I work for an independent agent. Farmers has an amazing training program. The University of Farmers has EVERYTHING you need to know about insurance, so if you are starting out or coming back to the field you feel support. The district office is very friendly and supportive. My agent is terrific. He loves his clients and company."
good,"Farmers is a great company to work for that provides an opportunity to professionals who want to advance, learn, and be in sales."
good,love the job but not the managment that was at my location kids and wife always at work not a good work place
good,"I learned how to navigate the old AS400 (green screen) system, as well as the new Farmers PC-version (Agency Dashboard) to investigate policy coverage changes and the impact on customer's billing questions.  "
good,"Great for part time financial needs."
good,"Learned self-management, how to network with local business professionals. Management at Farmers was excellent. Most enjoyable aspect of the job was the fact that you set and determine your own hours and schedule."
good,"A typical day at work was calling people who were involved in an automobile accidents, processing their claims or just helping or answering whatever questions they may have, regarding their claims. Management always find ways to educate, and motivate their employees and customer service is the number one goal. They also encourages us to be a team player. They appreciate their employees by giving bonuses or awards to those who deserves it. My co-workers are very helpful and always willing to cover someone's desk when they are out that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things everyday."
good,"Farmers is a good company to work for, great advancement opportunities."
good,"The typical day at work is basically slow. The customers don't come in unless needed or paying the bill and people sometimes call to get a insurance quote if they come to us. We always greet the customers with a smile. The manager is very serious, but laid back. My co-worker helps me when I need help. The hardest part of this job was talking to people and asking them questions. The most enjoyable part is knowing the day will go easier and the customers is just the best. "
good,"Great place to learn how to run a business. Great help, and excellent agent support."
good,"great district manager, company pricing not competitive. learned system"
good,"Management is very good, very results driven. Encourage you to be involved. Only critisism is that the is a lack of recognition for the standout performers."
good,I enjoy the insurance industry but lack the personal funds to create my own insurance agency. I was spending $1000 a month in marketing myself with a 1% return. I couldn't survive.
good,I really like working with all the staff and the customers. The environment was really nice and my boss taught me many new things. He taught me many new techniques on how to bring customers in and how to work phone service. I would go back and work for my former boss anytime.
good,"I have been with Farmers for going on four years. I have been treated fairly, and encouraged to develop. No other company I've seen actually pushes each individual to continue developing the way Farmers does. From continued education to leadership development, the only reason someone doesn't prosper is because they don't want to. I have not been fortunate enough to promote due to the economy and all that, however the opportunity to advance within one's own position is almost as impressive. I have definately been rewarded for the work I have done."
good,"Great opportunity, learned a lot of the basics to jump start a independent insurance career"
good,This is a great company to work for. Great management and work environment
good,"Great people and great benefits.  It's a lot of work, though, so be prepared to work hard.  I really learned a lot working with my supervisor and the managing partner."
good,"nice breakroom, pleasant management, ability for overtime was great especially since overtime could do at home. Not much room for movement up in company unless have degree."
good,"I learned a lot there and enjoyed working in an office invironment. Answered calls, received payments, provided customers with auto/home quotes, handled policy changes and helped customers with insurance claims."
good,"Poor senior management decisions. I got along well with my immediate supervisor, however when a new leadership team came in, they decided to make most tenured employees reapply for their jobs. Lots of quality employees were let go."
good,Great Company great people great culture.  I really enjoyed my time with Farmers Insurance.  Starting pay was not great but no other complaints.  Awesome company
good,I have had multiple positions with Farmers over the past 11 and a half years.  The opportunities are available as long as you are willing to go after them.  Relocation is alway a plus but not always required to move up.
good,"Would highly recommend this company. Great benefits, friendly coworkers, lots of advancement. Very good at keeping work and life balanced and always willing to work with you."
good,Seems the capital for updating and making changes to keep current on technology not really making it to the right place. Slow to bring changes competitors already offer.
good,"--A typical day varied whether I was in the office or traveling in the region. When in the office writing reports and scheduling my next trip. Attending weekly meeting when in the office."
good,At FIG corporate you have the opportunity to learn so much from your supervisors and managers. They take a personal interest in insuring that the members on their team succeed. There is plenty of room for expansion and the chance to climb up the corporate ladder.
good,"Working at Farmers is great. The people are good, but the insurance coverage isn't which might take a turn for the worse on the agency. nklnjklnkbnhohloljljl"
good,Farmers insurance is one of the best insurance companies there is. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Commission based or salary based income with regular business hours.
good,"Great place to work. Family owned business, everyone was very helpful."
good,Professional and caring to each and every client Great agent/owner to work for and enjoyed my time working there. Good people and taught me more to o ow about the insurance business.
good,I was able to learn a new trade at Farmers. I am learning the property side of the business to grow my own personal resume and brand. This will be a huge benefit as I aspire to move into management. This will make me a more well rounded individual with a plethora of information to pass onto others.
good,"Farmers Insurance has a good vision and a very clear direction. I believe they are very much looking to be unique and add value in a crowded market."
good,"I worked from home while with Farmers Insurance, it was a very flexible environment and I loved it.  My team was amazing and the leaders were very nurturing."
good,The boss that I had was an amazing boss. He was very understanding when it came to work and having a family to take care of. Overall I was very satisfied with my work place.
good,I answered phones in a one agent office.  I helped by getting insurance cards taking policy payments and reconciling the drawer and making deposits daily
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help people. You are laying out options and choices for them and not just trying to sell them. You want to help them choose what is right for them. That can also be the hardest part of the job. Since it is sales, there is pressure to want to make that next sell and it's hard if at the time being you aren't what's best for the customer price wise. Management is top notch in my opinion, very understanding and they actually coach and mentor you."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up, doing quotes for customers, answering phones/making phone calls and managing money at the end of day as well as going to the bank."
good,I enjoyed working at Farmers Ins. It was like one big family. It was upsetting when they started down sizing and I had to eventually leave the company.
good,What I loved most about working here is helping new and existing customers with their unique insurance needs. Getting to know customers through out the years and building their trust with us is what really matters to me the most. Those are the type of customers that will be loyal to your business forever! Be kind and treat every customer with respect and they will appreciate your services for a lifetime.
good,For this place I liked for many reasons in sales. Working with people giving them the option on very many quotes and giving them the understanding of how insurance can better there chances in life and in the long run is the best part you can give someone to know they can be safe and covered while they are on the road.
good,I enjoyed working for farmers. It is a Great company. Training was is informative and management was very helpful. I would definitely work there again.
good,"Good company but never a idle moment. High expectations with very aggressive work loads.  They do reward high achievers.   "
good,A lot of people sit in the same position for 20 years. They are very strict about degrees no mattter how good you are on the job or previous experience for the position you are applying for.
good,"Farmers Insurance is a great, fun environment that cares about the customer and their employees. They offer great benefits including PTO, and stock options, among other items of considerable value."
good,"Everyone at Farmer's seemed to be happy. Unfortunately, I had extenuating family emergencies that led me to leave. The company is going thru a transition trying to bring Farmers into Florida, but once that starts, I would expect things to pick up"

good,Working here gave me a lot of experience with Farmers and I appreciate how much they do for there customers. I got an office to myself and was left to learn at my own pace.

My boss treated her employees with the greatest management ways that made everyone learn a lot and gave us flexible tasks."

good,"A typical day at work involves wearing all the hats involved in owning your own business. This includes, but is not limited to, cold calling, marketing, direct sales, continuing education, and training. Co-workers were positive, proactive, and competitive, and maintained a sense of camaraderie. The District Office Manager was fair and positive."

good,"best to begin young- "
good,"As an agent assistant, I was in charge of making cold calls, which sometimes can be harsh, but also challenging and really different. Everyday at the office was different, it was either making phone calls or looking for events Farmers could go and sponsor."
good,"A typical work day looks like coming in first thing in the morning, checking you email, and making sure you have no customers in need of any high priority services. You then delegate what you need done and then you map out you day and appointments, along with the time you have allocated to marketing and generating leads and following up. Generally your days and weeks are mapped out in advance and you have a routine that sets you up for success in between appointments."
good,"I worked for Farmers Insurance for 18 months. They have always treated me like I was one of their own. Any time I had any personal home life issues with my children, they would work around my schedule. They taught me everything I know about the Insurance industry.

Management there was really good, if needed help in anything they would be there to help. The hardest part of the job was just keeping up with phone calls all at one time, other than that I really enjoyed working at Farmers as a receptionist."
good,"I loved it! it was a really good job. I answered the phones, took payments."
good,"o	Obtain estimate and photos for vehicle in need of repair"
good,"A typical day would be office work on word, excell, or powerpoint. My day would also consist of talking and allowing bilingual customers to understand the trade of the company while introducing them to an insurance agent. The most enjoyable was being able to work with diverse hispanic culture and being able to market out to them for awareness on the products."

good,A typical workday is very productive.
good,"Great hours, good, people, great products, Would recommend this company to anyone."

good,They paid for my insurance license. Worked with a private agent and grew close and eventually became the manager of everything. I would still work there but the agent moved and I would like something new
good,"Farmers is a great place to work if u actually like to work.  If you have a problem with being micro managed, do not apply.  I had nothing to hide and did my job.  Management was great, team structure was solid, and I really enjoyed my time there."
good,Working at Farmers was an amazing experience. The team I worked with was high functioning and incredibly dedicated to their Agents. Everyone from front line to the executives are friendly and supportive.
good,At the Time i interviewed for Farmers they were hiring through the district office and during your licensing process you interview again to be placed with an agent. After you interview and are placed with an agent you will continue to license and train at the district office. After training you then go to and work at that agency.
good,"Flexible hours, nice employer, friendly colleagues, good entry-level position."
good,Farmers matches 401 K 6%. I have worked there almost 9 years and I have 5 weeks vacation. The only reason I am leaving is because we are moving out of state.
good,"When I arrived in my working environment, I will go on the computer and see if my boss had any emails. I also answered two phones. One was for farmers insurance and the other was to forward the customer to people who worked for Powerhouse mortgage. What i learned being there was how the real world was going to be and how I needed to work very hard to be able to do everything in their liking. I couldn'thave asked for a better place to do my first working experience."

good,Farmers is a great place to work. Great benefits and incentives. I enjoyed working there and I will miss it very much. Farmers cares about their employees and families
good,They provided most things requested such as a standing desk and keyboard trays for those who needed them. There was a gym on site as well as a kitchen for employee utilization. They also provided quiet private rooms for breaks. Consistent work flow. For me the hardest part of the job was not being able to move around when I needed to. I like to be able to get up and move around fairly regularly. I personally would prefer working as a chat representative but they only provided call representative positions at my particular location.
good,very good place to work with fun people and the person to be around with are fun also. the enviorment of the office is always fun and productive you learn new things every single day

good,My time here has been the best. Flexible schedule and opportunity to interact with people daily.  Glad I chose this as part of my career path to a great way of life.

Inputting important paperwork into their account for verification and support. Talking to clients face to face or over the phone to pay their debt or help with their problems.
good,Working for Farmers Insurance was rewarding in that I was able to learn to make money by my own efforts. Our jobs required constant marketing practices and developing a relationship with customers so that they felt comfortable with our team.  Management was consistently very motivating in pushing the entire team to meet a monthly quota for sales.  I enjoyed learning new skills and practices in building relationships with customers and working with peers in a competitive environment
good,The work was challenging because you needed to be knowledgeable about insurance in various states and some are very different. It was very rewarding because most of the agents we worked with were great and very grateful to have their problems solved.
good,My manager and co-worker were great to work with.  We had a family-like work relationship and I truly enjoyed my time at Farmers. They were both helpful and kind.
good,I loved every minute of working at Farmers. I was in the Workers Compensation Claims Department. The supervisor was understanding. She was such a hard worker. You couldn't help but match her work ethic. It felt like home there. Can't say enough great things.
good,"Farmers is a good place to work but only if you are getting the training currently implemented.  If you started early on your training was scattered , page by page and not enough to entirely function at your job.  Management is great.  Farmers prefers to focus on call times more than customer service, some calls will take longer than other due to customers questions and their ability to understand.  The billing system at Farmers is confusing at times, not only to reps but to customers and agents as well."
good,Wonderful work expierience I learned so much and had a lot of help with everything I needed with the company . It was a fun work environment  even when dealing with difficult clients that were a challenge.
good,"This is a very helpful work place the managers doesn't make you feel ashamed about not knowing how to do certain task.

good,"This location was amazing, great staff, co workers and they are very flexible with flex time. "
good,"Great working environment. The job can be stressful but also rewarding. Competitive. If you are sales oriented you will be happy. Personally, I would rather not work in a sales driven environment."
good,Farmers is a great company to start a future career. I have only been with this company for 1 year and I can't see myself anywhere other then FARMERS!
good,"I feel so comfortable working here and not being micromanaged, the compensation is well, just wish they had benefits. All the people who work here are amazing and helpful."

good,I feel farmers insurance is a great opportunity.  If you want to start your own business.  This is my first career since 2006 its a real challenge to start a agency. The rewards are awesome.  I recommend a ex coworker to work there. The Owner hired her and she feels its a great career for her self.
good,The advancement is hard to come by. Everyone is very help full but i need advancement. They don't have a lot of one on one training you kind of have to know what you are doing and how to sale.
good,"Maintained and coordinated executive day-to-day meeting schedules. Arranged catering for meetings. Worked directly with over 25 agents assisting with training and daily agency operations and service requests. Investigated issues and problems and drafted responses to urgent requests. Handled and distributed all incoming and outgoing mail.  Maintained phone, computers and printer-copier systems."
good,"A claim adjustor position with Farmers is very fast paced and not for the feint of heart.  You are often put in hostile negotiations with vendors due to the nature of the position."
good,Changes in management and the company are not often handled well by new managers. The hardest part of the job is being flexible with all of the inconsistencies.
good,"Great, safe place to work"
good,"The office environment is amazing, everyone is so helpful and available. They expect a lot from you as you have a lot of little things to remember in claims adjusting. But the people and advancement opportunities along with the support of upper management is incredible."
good,This was my first job every if I could continue I would but unfortunately they went out of business😭 this is an excellent job to start an career with if looking into
good,"Quoting a person insurance for their home, vehicle etc. Making sure that I close the deal is my concern. The costumers get insurance from me and they send more costomers because I treat them all like family."
good,"I enjoy working heer.  It always presents new opportunities to learn.  As an attorney, i constantly interact with claims adjusters, clients, judges, attorneys, and their staff.  It helps being a ""people person."""
good,This was a great company to have worked for but in the same instance I feel that if you employ yourself to the company for a long period of time they should be obligated to hire long term temp employees.
good,"One of if not the most challenging opportunities I have had, but also very educational. I have learned more in the last year about running a business then the past 15+ years working for a large corporation. Now I want to take that knowledge and apply it to my next opportunity and be very successful."
good,"I really enjoy working there. Great company. The sales environment is tough but if you can stick with it, the skies the limit. You must be willing to make it work."

good,Farmers insurance was a great company to work for.  I was sadden when the owner retired and closed the doors. I made great friends and learned a new skill working in the insurance field.
good,"Great company to world for. Offers a lot of benefits. Management tries to make working in a call center as fun as can be. The downside is that you are at a desk, on the phone and computer all day."
good,"- good opportunities to advance"
good,An agency of your own. Support from our award-winning University of Farmers® training program. An experienced industry professional that can serve as your business coach. All this can lead to an opportunity for success.
good,"My role is in the call center, so I am on the phone all day. My job is to answer calls and file claims regarding auto accidents or property. Also there are plenty of incoming calls regarding existing claims that callers have additional questions about. It can be very routine, filing the same claims call after call but each caller has a different story that gives it that little twist. It can be rewarding to help out someone in their time of need."
good,"Farmers Insurance was a great company. The people who worked there were wonderful, supportive and very helpful with any questions I had. The reason I left was simply because I couldn't see myself as an insurance agent 10 years from now."
good,"Enjoyed  the everyday challenges of management  such as recruiting, counseling and striving to accomplish the company goals.  The hardest part of the job was answering to the public things I could not control.  Probably the most enjoyable was the company trips I was able to take my wife on for surpassing quotas and objectives."
good,I learned a variety of skills in this position that has allowed me to grow in my career endeavors. It had a great staff which gave a lot pf support.
good,"I worked for Farmers for 1+ years and it was amazing. I loved the people I worked with and I loved how they ran the office. They were not just any agent you find on the street. They care about people and want to make sure people are covered. They are not out to give just the minimum coverage for the cheapest price to get the sale. A typical day I would make cold calls and receive information for proposals. I learned a lot working there. How to put together a quote and how to address people and the problems they may be having. The management was really good. I feel I could have undergone a bit more sales training but overall a very good management staff. My coworkers were amazing, we had our lady that does billing who calls whenever somebody might be late, she worked out payment plans with customers. She also calls every single customer on their birthdays. Our account manager was very quick and efficient with helping people with their problems. She called on every single renewal and let the customer know if their renewal had gone up or down, she made sure that they received their documents as well. Our agent did the same thing that I did, he called people that he quoted before and made cold calls. He is very knowledgeable in the product and the ins and outs of insurance. The hardest part of the job for me was making sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely helping people out, between having higher coverages and lower deductibles and saving them money at the same time. I loved my time working there and am very grateful for the opportunity."
good,"A typical day was all customer service. We go above and beyond to be available to all of our customers at least 12 hours per day. I've learned to talk to people on their level, and to calm down potentially explosive situations. I've learned to hire and fire employees. I've learned to keep very detailed records, and a paper trail for everything. The hardest part of the job would be long hours. The most enjoyable would be helping our customers, and making sure their needs are met."
good,"The Johnson Agency is amazing. I did what I needed to do to grow my business and it is fine. However, I am selling it."
good,Getting started in the business is difficult and takes a lot of time away from your family.  Being well connected in your community and having a lot of contacts to call on are the means to success in the business.
good,"My typical day was spent working on expense control and managing the budget.   It required me to work with everyone within the department.   I was able to see the results of my work.   My enjoyment came when goals were achieved by giving the employees the training and the confidence  to do their job on their own with little supervision.  That they could come to me, I would listen and help them as needed.  "
good,"I worked for this Agent 12 years nearly 10years ago."

good,I had a very supportive boss no matter what the circumstances was. There was only 2 people in the office at all times and he made sure the business was 100% no matter what.
good,I enjoyed working for Farmers. I was under a new agent that was ambitious and knowledgeable. I learned much about the industry and how to cater our products to customers under him. I sold over forty policies and enjoyed providing a service that helps people when the unfortunate happens in life. It is gratifying to know when they loose belongings we are there to help make sure that they are not financially devastated and can continue in the comforts they know.
good,"It has very learning environment..."
good,"My work experience has been very positive. The company is very structured regarding the expectations from the PMO. They utilize standard practices and require reporting at the program level that lends to efficiency in effort. The leadership and direction were clear and concise. When changes happened the stakeholders were very vocal and were willing to listen to discussions and suggestions from their project managers and workstream leads. "
good,typical day of work included setting up the store. answering phones and working with clients filing and product selling. quoeting. I learned so much here at this job it really made me look forward to a successful future I really wanted to be and agent. the hardest part of the job was that I could not pass the exam but was close the best part were the people .. my coworkers were great and I was able to create and outside relationship with them!

good,A typical day is i would look at the call out page to call home owners/ car owners and business owners. Trying to make appointments and doing quote sheets. my managers was  very nice and gave me the best opportunity they could of ever gave me. The hardest part of the job was when some people would yell at me on the phone. Most enjoyable was getting a experience that i thought id never have.
good,Responsible for keeping company system updated. Scanned old and new clients into system for future leads. Alphabetized an filed away paperwork. Looked for important information in old files for new quotes and leads. Distributed and picked up daily mail. I was taught managerial duties an how to multi-task.

There are growth opportunities and a fabulous H.R. department that truly cares for it's employees. In my experience, the employees all work as a team to reach a common goal."
good,"Initially, a typical day included meeting reserve contract requirements. In the course of my career with Farmers starting in May of 2002, I was on the reserve program. However, after a few months, I chose to redirect my options as a producer under Michael Valdez for a mentorship opportunity. Upon the guidance of a new district manager, Nicolas Lezama, 8 months later was encouraged to work again as a career agent. This allowed me the first opportunity to work on a newly initiated mentorship program with a retiring agent where work days included meeting with current clients to review for gaps in coverage under new Tort Laws, home walk-throughs, life/family needs and workers' compensation/business liability needs. After consideration for my own personal family needs, this position transitioned to working for another agent, C. Scott Kay as an office manager/producer nearly 4 years. This was due to the work overload that necessitated an opportunity to better balance work and personal life while also enjoying the many aspects of outside marketing and selling a branded product. Daily duties consisted of answering calls, quoting, utilizing Reference USA to integrate with agent portal marketing programs  and soft selling in a cross selling environment."
good,Sales a lilttle hard when people turn you away but you just move on. Its fun to work with people.

State regulations, how premiums work, etc.  I worked with my husband so of course I loved my management and co-worker.  I answered phone calls with clients who needed answers to questions, figured up quotes of insurance and took payments.  The hardest part was never being able to take vacation for the fact both my husband and I worked together.  But it was also the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"I can honestly say that Farmers is a well oiled machine.  It has wonderful policies and procedures in place.  I was very impressed with the tech support, the service center and the management. My co-workers were very friendly and we worked well together.  The hardest part of being in the insurance industry is making sure that everyone in the office knows the importance of having every I dotted and every t crossed.  For me the most enjoyable part of this job is helping clients with all of their insurance needs."
good,"I was a claims adjuster for Farmers and covered a specific line called foremost. When i got hired i was out of college just a year and had no experience in this field, farmers hired me and trained me very well, they sent me my home district office to train for 2 weeks then to training in Michigan for 3 weeks and made sure we knew how to do everything properly. After that training the sent me to field training with an experienced adjuster to train for several weeks letting me get a guiding hand doing my first claims, then set me out on my own. They provided me with a company car, phone laptop, gas card, credit card, ladder and any tool i requested. My managers were always respectful and always pushed me to do my best and believed in me. I worked from a home office in my territory and my manager came about once a month to ride along and do claims with me. Farmers was constantly sending us to further training to make sure we were always on top of things in the changing industry. They also did a retreat with the entire zone every other year that was really a chance for everyone to have fun and get to know our coworkers all on the companies dime. They truly cared for the employees."

You make your own hours...if your daughter has a school play at 3pm, you can make it.  The most enjoyable part of the job, is actually having appointments with clients and educating them on the knowledge to protect their assets and save money on their insurance needs.  Not many insurance agents do that anymore.  There are too many insurance companies with 800 numbers that care less about your needs and just give the same insurance quote to everyone.  No matter if you have $10 to your name or $10,000,000 to your name."

Early in my career the daily duties were regular phones, filing, data entry, planning events and other secretarial duties. After being there a while I started training people how to use the computer systems and software in addition to the normal. That lead to having goals and helping the agents meet deadlines and getting bonuses or Trips as incentives. I find it very satisfying to get things done under pressure and we certainly did that.  After 10 years there wasn't much I could do to advance but I would go back again. Some of the agents were wonderful people and there is definitely a family atmosphere in that district."

I gave a lot to that company, put in lots of work and I felt I was getting the run around.  Before I quit I was promised lots of things that I earned by working hard and never received.

If there is one difficult part about my job, its hard to get a hold of people when trying to offer them a free quote , or just even getting back to the customer to finish any additional information we are needing to finish a quote.
