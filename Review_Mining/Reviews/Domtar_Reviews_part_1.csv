rating,review
bad,"managed by someone who nobody there wants to deal with although many complaints have been placed against him.lousy hours, the pay is not competitive at all."
bad,"This review isn’t helpful to employees of the company so please scroll on by. I just want to warn my fellow truckers that if you’re delivering or picking up from this place, be prepared to wait forever and a day just to get in a dock. Even if you’re first in line, you’ll easily wait 2-3 hours or more. Then once you’re in a dock, be prepared to wait another 2-3 hours. Just letting you know it’s not an in and out type of facility."
bad,domtar is no longer in business in canada.  but at the time the people i worked with were great but the union people were selfish and couldn't care less if you needed the job. if you werent union you shouldnt be working there
bad,"Ten years behind in safety, leadership is non existent,maintenance has been ignored for decades causing many breakdowns, low production and safety concerns. Supervisors are uneducated and nepotism is a large problem in this environment."
bad,Management is essentially all contractors. Should speak for itself. They demand you to be going for 12 hours straight. If you dare have a seat in control room prepare for written warnings and an earful. Turnover is averaging about 1 person a month over the last number of years. This is a stepping stone job for steam time. Don't read that shift engineers comment who loves it. They are all worked hard due to lack of shift engineers because half are contractors.  They live under constant stress of potentially being fired over disobedience even when they are right. They are supposed to be second class but couldn't find anybody to take it so they dropped their standards to a 3rd class willing to write seconds. Save yourself
bad,"In the last 3 years they have brought in a new mill manager who is mentally challenged and has small man issues"
bad,"Absolutely the worst company I've ever worked for.  Staff and management are extremely inexperienced and under qualified.  Many human rights,  employment standards act and occupational health and safety infractions have occurred by supervisors and the human resources department refuses to deal with the issues and the grievances they have caused.  Should have never come to work here."
bad,"Domtar had no focus or concrete plan.They wanted to break into the US market but didn't want to market to the US. I left because inteh 4 years that I was there, there were 4 MAJOR reorganizations which frequently left many unemployed or in  jobs that they were completely unsuited for."
bad,"Management is terrible.  There is no leadership. Nobody there has a clue.  They treat you like a number. Pay is good but no real room for advancement. They talk safety, but that’s all b.s.   All goes by favoritism.  Not a good place to work."
bad,"Extremely poor management at local (Kingsport) facility"
bad,"Terrible union that makes up rules as they go along, old DCS technology with no sign of upgrades coming, safety is said to be a priority, but only when a lost time injury occurs, worker suggestions are quickly swept aside ""because that's how we do things here"""
bad,Management and site safety culture sucks!!! Get to told to be safe till you have a job to do. Cover up management mistakes that cause an individual harm then blame the individual for it. Write you up for putting in the wrong material to fix something and tell you If you don't you'll get written up for insubordination either way they will screw you.
bad,"Working at Domtar is a life changing experience day by day.  One day you get a permanent role the next, your position is discontinued due to restructuring and your whole life changes again causing financial distress. "
bad,"I worked at domtar pulp and paper for 6 years and I found that it was slowly going downhill with maintenance and management,it did pay well and had good benefits but I found that it would not be a job I'd want for life."
bad,"I worked here as an electrician. They rotate you through different departments every 4 months before they put you on shift. I had no problems in the first dept and enjoyed working with the people and the bosses. "
bad,I have nothing to say about the job it was minimum wage you can’t make a living out of that to many grown people working their for 7$ Packing gets tiring.
bad,"They love to hire from outside the company, usually from a competitor. "
bad,Very unsafe someone is likely to be killed. Work there at your own risk. Management dont care about workers. Rules are not followed and management turns their heads.
bad,Don't do it unless you're desperate. Pay is good but not worth it after a while of dealing with management. There is no work life balance. They expect you to live and breath Domtar and give up everything else. They slam you with overtime with no secound thought amd the only way to get relief is to gain some senority. Everything goes by seniority. Its every man for himself at this place. Management will try to get over on you every chance they get. Within a few months you will hate your job.
bad,"Regular Southern Swing if you are on a perm. job.  if not you are shifted around, can work up to 15 days no day off.  Pay is awsome, work is hot, hot, hot, labor intensive."
bad,"Heavy industrial setting with large production demands.  Very physical workwith high mental stress. 24/7/365. Rotating shifts, mandatory overtime, cancelled off days, Highly compensated and premium benefits. "
bad,"Some great people hourly and staff, "
bad,just a job. no chance of advancement. management is totally oblivios to what is happening. morale is at all time low and employee turnover at all time high. they just don't care. seems just biding time till they can retire.
bad,"Although the pay was great, the management is bipolar.  Make one wrong move and your out, question decisions on a ""bad day"" and your out no discussion, no logical discipline, no coaching."
bad,"If you are young and haven't any work experience you will go far!"
bad,Work every other weekend and get mandatory overtime a lot because they maintain minimal staffing. 12 hour days with only 1 30 min. lunch. Amazing benefits and wellness programs.
bad,Management is uninvolved in the day to day operations. They have no empathy for staff who are overworked. Excessive mandatory overtime makes for an unsafe working environment. Many work-related accidents/incidents are swept under the rug and not properly reported. Staff work nearly 60 hours each week and changes to schedules are frequently made at the last minute without employees knowledge. Morale is low as everyone is burnt out from being overworked.
bad,"The difference in work environment that I noticed during my 4 years was surprising.   Initially upon hiring, you are required to complete a 4 month rotation though the three difference ""areas"" of the mill and then are placed in your permeant area.  After a full year you then complete ""shift training"" that only lasts about 6 weeks.  The training you are given is lacking and does not have much structor other than the power house portion.   "
bad,Domtar pays good and has good benefits. But the management is horrible. They don't let the people working on the equipment make any decisions. This is the people who sees the equipment every day. The decisions are made from the offices without even looking at the equipment. The only reason this mill is still running is because it produces too much paper quantity to shut down. The quality is pathetic. And it's all managements fault. They don't care. It's pathetic.
bad,Good place to work overall. Pay & benefits were highly competitive along with an excellent in-house training program.
bad,"A good company to work for but don't expect to make much in salary as it operates on very thin margin business, my wages after 10 yrs of employement actually went down as years passed, I was making less money after 10 yrs then 1st yr?? People were great, had a lot of fun. If it wasn't for low salary I'd still be there. I really enjoyed  working with my manager, awesome guy..."
bad,"The converting center  is very fast paced,very productive. Management is very over bearing and very controlling work 12 hour shifts without a break most of the time , Not enough help and ""some of the supervisors talk to and treat employees like dirt."" They are always trying to catch you doing something wrong  Just because they can.Need to put there supervisors through some management courses.. Good money but there are way better opportunities out there."
bad,"Donner un service, transporter des matieres dangereuses avec un camion à benne dans le site d'enfouissement."
bad,Domtar is shutting down half of the kamlops operation and I'm getting laid off!!!
good,"A typical day of work is answering all calls from internal clients and replying to their request and incidents via email and resolving their issues as much as possible unless it needs to be transfered to second level."
good,Company tends  to exhibit favoritism towards certain employees and there is difficulty getting a promotion in this company even after consecutive high rated performance reviews and being there for almost 5 years. I wouldn't recommend working here if you expect to quickly advance your career.
good,"Workforce had a very ""non-management attitude"" Anyone going above what was expected was looked down upon. Opportunity for advancement was dependent on tenure only."
good,Was a good place to work. Due to management decision it was better to close mill. Order were transfered to other mills. Paper industry is dying out. Not a stable  job .
good,"It’s a hot factory in summer & cold in winter. New hires are treated poorly & those that have been there long time are miserable and like to pick at new hires. It’s a total gossip mill! Lots of negative miserable people on hourly shifts. Shifts are rotating ABCD shift. It’s not a happy place but the paychecks will keep you there. It’s depressing honestly, especially if you’re a creative person"
good,"I typical day is very busy and fast paced.  We are a global company.  Currently every order or quote presented to the sales desk must be approved by 1 person.  Understand, that every ORDER and QUOTE has to pass across 1 particular persons desk for approval.  There are approximately 60 Sales Service Reps in the office and every order and quote received by each 60 SSR's is looked over and approved by 1 particular person.  It is a nightmare!"
good,No clear direction. Lack of communication. Upper management completely disconnected from reality and happenings in the mill. Has become very political!
good,The pay is good.   The work is not hard once you get it down.  Newer folks do not get the training they need because there is no training dept.  They are pretty much thrown to the gators.  People doing training need training themselves.   Management does not seem to care about employees....you can never do enough.   Knowledgeable people are discounted....not listened to.   Morale continues to decline.
good,Domtar makes paper.  This industry is in difficulty.  My work was meaningful.  Decline further discussion.
good,"I do not mind working here. I like the job, but it is too slow paced and not enough work to do in a day and I find myself bored a lot, which I do not like."
good,"Domtar is a very old fashioned company with no flexibility. It's against the company policy to work from home and if you have a doctor appointment expect to use your vacation days. Pulp and paper is a declining industry so management will do anything to drive up their performance and usually they do that at expense of the employees, strict budgeting and work overload. They try to save even on the office supply so forget about salary raise."
good,For the most part you love the people you work with. Management sticks they don't care about you. The hours can change at anytime and expect to work the Holidays.
good,"The only good thing about this is place are the coworkers and the good pay. "
good,This job was very inconsistent at times depending on where you were placed at. You could have up to 4 hours of downtime a day on your line if your technicians were having problems with the machine on your line. You got 3 breaks and a lunch break which was nice.
good,"DPC would be a great business to work for if they cared more about their employees. Things change out here so much it's hard to have a life outside of work. ""Consistency"" is not apart of the vocabulary for DPC at the moment. The moral is very low and the employees are getting angrier by the week. There is so much stress on the converting floor from constant schedule changing and strenuous work loads.  "
good,The management always emphasize the importance of the safety of all the employees. They have safety training for all.
good,Domtar help me when I was without a job I worked as a packer at firs and then start growing in potition I start in wrap make test I get qualify  for machin operator
good,The first day at Domtar went amazing they showed us how to work on the line. A couple of weeks the operators showed me so many thing that can make the job easier.
good,Ok Place to work Nothing Special. There is structural defect In IT organization and lacks coordination. The inter deparmental liason is minimum> trhe project managers from Canada lack Project knowledge
good,just OK not really much more to say just an OK place to work. pay raises done by favoritism not necessarily job performance.  some unrealistic assessments of capabilities.
good,Enjoy my time at Domtar.  The work was hard labor however I learned some valuable skills that I can implement in future jobs going forward.  I appreciate my tenure at the paper mill.
good,"This is a place that has a good moral among it's employees, and that makes it an enjoyable company to work for.. They look out for your safety more than other places that I have heard of, and they are also looking out for your health.  The incentives for safety and good health are a great encouragement to live a healthy lifestyle."
good,"I got there in the middle of a merge with Staple."
good,I enjoy my time their. Very good and safe work environment. Co-workers and shift leads are very helpful. I learned a lot as a machine operator and I would recommend working here because of the opportunities.
good,"Domtar demeure une bonne entreprise. Cependant, je préfère donner mes  avis avec CST Canada Co."
good,"Very busy, fast moving.  People are friendly and work experience was great. No advancement, as the paper division is moving to the USA."
good,Communication between management and front line employees needs improvement but overall it is a good place to work.
good,Better benefits…more enjoyable and proactive upper management.
good,"A hot and fast paced atmosphere, with a high demand on the employees.  Although working safe is a high priority for the company as a whole.  Worked as a team, with co-workers, throughout the work day.  The most enjoyable part of the day is that at times, the paper I make I have a chance to load that finished product on a truck to a costumer.  Giving me the satisfaction of completion, and knowing that I have produced and shipped a high quality product."
good,"A day would consist of answering phone, preparing daily inventory reports, entering orders and quotes, making sure oders ship on time. Processing returns and credits when needed. A fun environment but no challenge and no room for advancement. I do enjoy their focus on community programs and being a part of the wellness commitee."
good,I was at this company a total of 13 years.  The review section here is the same as stated before.  Good values-the company supports wellness at work.  They give back to the community.
good,"Busy,hot,daily safety meetings within teams.Weekly safety meetings with management and available team members.Filling out pre task forms,quality catch forms,hazard analysis forms and multipe,seemingly repetitive,forms.Cleaning and keeping work area safe.Assisting operator and other team members requiring help."
good,"Apprentissage ardu"
good,8-5 office receptionist job   manned the front desk answered the phone greeted visitors made appointments for vendors to be seen  collected data for weekly and monthly statistic reports
good,I was with Domtar for 24 + years. At the time of my employment they ceased operations in the Indianapolis facility. To continue my employment with them I had to relocate out of state.
good,"Was a great secure employer when I started in the ‘80s, however shady acquisitions, political arrangements, and national union manipulations resulted in Carbon Emissions and Energy Consumption along with lack of government intervention, the results were deadly for the Cornwall and various other non Quebec facilities were permanently shut down and demolished."
good,"Great place to learn about a very broad spectrum of equipment encountered in our field."
good,"Go in as an hourly person you have it made, other than having to work shift work.  Would recommend to anyone as far as that goes if they don't mind that aspect.   Will she be running in 10 years??  Who knows."
good,Overall this has been a good place to work.  The major change that I see is that you have to put aside family time to advance in the organization.  There is no longer a work/life balance with upper management.  The Entry Level Engineers that are coming into this organization out of school works there a couple of years and then move on to a different company that is more worker friendly.
good,"Overall a very good place to work people are great and work hard together, however they have seen a major downsize in the paper industry overall and that has put a damper on the people working there."
good,I've been given many opportunities to learn new skills and train on new jobs. I like my supervisors and coworkers and feel like part of a team.
good,"Domtar was a good place to work, they had a 24/7 operation. Management had a good relationship with workers."
good,"J'ai bien aimé cette entreprise les employés sont super."
good,"Since the merger of other companies into Personal Care, things have been very different. We do not receive much communication from Leadership regarding the direction/ changes within the business. The moral is low and a lot of seasoned employees are worried about their future with the company. ."
good,"Some scheduled preventative maintenance but mostly fire fighting at this mill. Weak management - no expectations in some departments, without accountability or followup. Inventory was limited due to standards of equipment being broadscaled. Learned to use what was available to ensure a quick fix and try to keep reliability. Enjoyed environmental monitoring equipment as well as the gas detection. Area of responsiblities included the Steam plant, air supply systems (driers), water - mill and feedwater."
good,"If you like the warehouse/factory setting, this job is for you. One of the nicest factories I have worked at. First, the shift was started off with a safety meeting, and we would go over numbers from the previous shift. We go out to our spots at one of the diaper lines and relieve the shift before us. My position was assistant operator A. Which was second in responsibilities right below the Team Leader. The job requirements were to be able to stand on your feet for hours, observation skills; looking for quality defects/ making adjustments. Working with tools; replace machine parts if damaged, or during changeovers. Management was constantly finding ways to strive. In productivity and safety. The coworkers were like a family, they all knew who I was and I had a good relationship with everyone of them. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for 12 hours. And the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,Prepping rolls and having them ready to put on machine. Was able to learn how to clean and run machine. Management was well. Loved my co-workers on my line. Hardest part was trying to get machine up and running when it shut down.
good,Domtar is a great company to work for. They are the leading supplier of fine paper in the united states and leading supplier of fluff pulp in the world. I work for a converting facility that makes paper which unfortunately is an industry that is declining at a rate of 4% each year.
good,"It is a typical Mill environment with heat, chemicals, and dirt.  It's not for a person who wants a clean easy environment but the people are mostly decent."
good,"They care nothing about what is going on in your personal life at all. You have no sick days and if you are sick or a child they expect you to come in regardless of being out on doctors orders,"
good,"Good company, with good benefits, but lacks in advancement opportunities. There is not enough opportunity to advance, in your position, and at times feels as though when you are good at what you do, the company would rather keep you where within your position yet move others, who are not as beneficial, on to higher areas."
good,It was a pleasant place to work. It did get stressful at times and overtime was mandatory. The worst part of the job is the stress it puts on your body.  Not so much physical just you rotate 1st to 2nd to 3rd shift every week.  Your sleep pattern never adjust
good,AHP was a great place to work. I got to learn so much about the manufacturing industry which ultimately allowed me to grow so fast with the company and make a name for myself there.
good,"the day would start receiving raw data from customers, this data was entered into the computer system for daily processing. the work was very high stress due to the Must complete nature of the business. However at the end of the day the work was rewarding after deadlines where met. with the satisfaction of a job completed accurately and on time."
good,I started with this company back on 2015 I started there as a temporary job packing diapers then with hard work I moved to a operator position then after earn a spot as a line leader
good,"Salaire très élevé pour une personne ne possédant qu'un secondaire 5."
good,"Great pay lots of overtime available"
good,Assembly line with 5 workers and we rotated every 30 mins. I learned how to package palatalize and stock diapers that the company produced. I enjoyed the work area and the ones i worked with.
good,Good place to work. Cares about employees well being for the most part. Would like to see more information about the company to employees from site managers. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a good career.
good,"good benefits, diverse work force, promotes from within has a good wellness package and works with employees to improve safety in the work place. room for improvement."
good,Long hours. Great people to work around. Small amount of politics and red tape with management. Pay was decent. Always learned something different everyday.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is by far the people. It is a fast paced environment that is ever-changing. Management has a genuine interest in the development of its employees
good,"A typical day at work included working on a hot and humid paper machine. You didn't get set breaks, but that could be a good thing if the papermachine is running right. I also learned what hard work is all about and paying attention to safety."
good,Working with DOMTAR was fun to learn and develop new enhancements.
good,The facility I was employed with has since closed. When open it was a good place to work. It employed several of my family members and alot of my community.
good,Domtar was a fast paced environment with something always happening. The industrial setting can cause some issues between management and hourly workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Domtar. However, they did shut the mill down that I was working but that is because of how the industry has changed & the product line was not protifiable"
good,Domtar is a good company .I worked two years for this company and learned a lot .I was able to learn data entry and how go fill oreders also learned the proper way to load truck.
good,"Good job, excellent pay and benefits.Worked 3rd shift which was 11pm-7am. Lots of overtime if you want it. Hardest part of the job is running good quality in a timely manner."
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Domtar. My position was challenging and rewarding. My coworkers were always ready and willing to help.
good,"Its a great place to work if you do not have a family,  but don't get me wrong this job do take care of your family and pay the bills. Machines often goes down a lot due to lack of help. The hardest part of this job is troubleshooting the line when you have no idea cause the line was just running. The most enjoyable part about the job is the people."
good,working for domtar has really made me a better forklift operator on a single forklift and single double also learning how to load trucks in a timely manner
good,"Overall, I enjoy working for Domtar. The schedule isn't my favorite part but that's the nature of the paper industry. The benefits are above average and my coworkers are world class."
good,"Job security is great. Advancement is slow because of low turnover rate. Good compensation,  Rarely works weekends. On the job training is available. Tuition reimbursement is available."
good,Really good about work balance. The company is big about meeting and getting the co-workers together every year. I liked the people that I worked with.
good,"heavy in-bounds and outbound 2 or 3 days a week."
good,"Good management and helpful co-workers"
good,"I have good people to work with, but manager in my department does not do a good job, his management skills are not as good as they should be for the amount of experience he claims to have."
good,"Great variety of work to utilize your skills."
good,"Quand on travaille chez Domtar, on ressent un fort sentiment d'appartenance."
good,I operated a off-set printing press from 11:00pm to 7:00am.
good,"Domtar is a fun place to work, with caring people who work hard to achieve success.  Vacation and holidays are generous.  I enjoyed my time at Domtar."
good,"Not a lot of advancement options, great benefits until Obamacare, great people to work with though....................................................."
good,"I was hired as a temporary employee at said company for six months and was turned down for the permanent job when it came up due to a lack of experience, Most days at said company were spent testing paper for basis weight, caliper, ash content, porosity, smoothness, tensile strength, formation, opacity and stiffness. I learned about typical lab equipment and daily maintenance and calibration. Management is top notch, they are fair and look out for their employees. My co-workers were great, we got along very well. Most employees at said company are very friendly and approachable."
good,"I provided analysis each day.  Worked with multiple teams and led teams.  Communicated with multiple groups: sales, marketing, operations in different manufacturing plants.  Managed advertising agency."
good,Knowledge enhancement in skillset as well as business processes is encouraged.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Domtar. It has been a great learning experience and I have been able to practice the skills associated with my trade. They have a great pension and benefits package.
good,"You get to involve your colleagues a lot and the floor space reflects it, as there has been special accommodation made for it. Management is usually on a different level."
good,This is a very fast pace work environment and must be on your toes as it can be very dangerous. Great people to work with and very good pay. These is a lot of problem solving when the machine breaks down. Must be willing to think out of the box and try new things.
good,"teams work well together -- everyone is helpful and willing to mentor/train - share hints "
good,"Selling was challenging because of corporate firm  and often inconsistent stance on pricing.  My territory was locked  (ocean west) not able to sell into Mexicoper corporate decree, and no potential customers in eastern desert areas).  Unable to compete with imports priced consistently 10-15% lower."
good,"Great place filled with great people. "
good,"En période importante de retraite/embauche depuis 3 ans;"
good,"Environnement convivial, acceuillant. Clients régulier ce qui rendait le travail plus agréable."
good,"Learned how to drive fork lifts, and learned the basics of team work. Co-workers are hard working people, and they expect you to be just as hard working, which is a good thing. Security is top notch, no one was hurt on the job while i was there. Cafeteria food was expensive, but its better to pack a lunch."
good,Worked at Domtar Kamloops from April 2019 to August 2019. Enjoyed my time there and management was very supportive and knowledgeable. Company is forward thinking and continues to look for improvement.
good,"Domtar Ashdown Mill is a paper and pulp facility.  It provides a good work environment that includes safety training, on the job training, hourly and salary pay,"
good,"Great job just didn't like the way it ended,"
good,Having only worked there for 3 weeks as this is being typed. I do not have worthy opinion. I like that they give you a $125 allowance to order uniforms shirts and $100 shoe allowance on your first day. You can wear jeans or uniform pants. It is fast pace work.
good,it was a good job when I was there I clean the bathrooms and the office I took trash out and keep the break clean did windowns and pick trash up out side
good,Nice place to work. Friendly environment. Steady hours and acceptable pay base. I would recommend many others to work for this company. Overall great job!
good,"We tended to paint or clean the factory or do random chores for the management. It wasn't the most exciting job in the world, but it paid very well. Did not learn anything there."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Domtar      Lots of opportunities   I will miss the people that I worked with!                                                              "

good,Domtar is a progressive company that sees itself beyond the pulp and paper world. I am proud to say I worked for the organization . I helped bring forward the innovative ideas they had and I grew as a person as well.
good,"You place to work. You could move up if you have the desire to and work hard. Good benefits and during peak periods there is mandatory overtime. Having mechanical knowledge is a plus, for you do a lot of your own maintenance."
good,"Good company to work for.  Travel is required in some positions, Benefits are great PTO is average middle management could be better.  Company tends to overlook behavior of middle management as far as any kind of complaint you make."
good,Very good place to work. Good pay great people. Paid vacations. Make sure you always have something to do even when slow. Benefits are amazing!!! Great 401k
good,"working at Domtar had a family atmosphere ,we all worked as a team"
good,"Domtar is a great company to work for and I have learned a lot, but sitting in front of a computer all day is something I don't want to do anymore. I would like to have more face to face interaction with customers and move around more."

good,"Many opportunities to learn different areas of network such as severs, routers and project work.  Worked with individual users on daily bases with in house applications."
good,"My typical day as an oiler is to be given numerous work orders that entail planning, routes, different types of oils or greases for each application, sometimes walking long distances or climbing many flights of stairs with loads, in-doors and outside. Management and all co-workes integrate into a good working relationship. As with almost any job, there are hard dirty area, also there are a number of easy chores, and all are handled in ways that makes the company profitable."
good,Work 3 shifts being able to run different machines and make good products
good,The paper industry is constantly changing and growing with a giant demand for new ideas and fresh workers.  There is room for advancement but not always internally.  The company is fun and the employees are dedicated and devoted.

good,"You will meet all kinds of people at domtar, i personally worked with the ppm crowd, which is basically the construction crew, they are exactly what you'd expect, cruel jokes, dirty, nosy, and allow others to treat women poorly. I had trouble with some of the guys and finally told the supervisor and nothing was done to them or about it, just basically a slap on the wrist and told to stop, which they didn't. the domtar employees are much more enjoyable to be around, people who have manners and a good sense of right and wrong."
good,"A typical day at Domtar as Supervisor was busy.  Always problem solving since the nature of the department being service related.  Mail miss delivered, parcels too heavy, receptionist calls in sick last minute, meeting room required NOW but no rooms available.  "

good,"Les possibilitsé de développement"
good,"Domtar was a nice place to work. The management was overly fair and treated their employees more like family than employees. I guess after 25 years it seemed more like a family than a job. I learned quite a bit from the time I was there from loading presses to loading trucks to basically doing anything I could to help in any way I could. My co-workers was great most of them been there longer than I and they seemed to care about each other instead of back stabbing one another, most of them. I guess the hardest part of the job was now that I look at it was when they closed the plant. I never did mind a little hard work, it goes with the pay. It's hard to say what the best part was other than just being a part of the Domtar family."

good,"I worked 12 hour rotating shifts, one week days and then one week nights plus any overtime that was required to fill. My typical day or night started at 6:00am or 6:00pm. The first thing I did was make relief, communicating any safety issues, quality issues, maintenance issues,grade changes, personnel issues, machine reliability, or anything that you feel is important for your relief to know no matter how simple it maybe. I was multi-skilled, I could work anywhere in my department and be proficient on the task at hand. I have learned so many valuable lessons that I value and even use them in my home life. I learned to never take safety for granite and even though I am at home I still wear proper safety equipment. Another value lesson I learned is not to be judgmental, you never know what your co-worker is going through. I learned that knowing how to do a job right the first time is a necessity in production work. I can not say enough good things about our managers we had at the mill. Our managers conducted the business side of our department. They had complete confidence in our abilities to make decisions and get the finished product out to perfection to meet ship dates. My co-workers were some of the greatest people I have known in my life. I am a people person so it wasn't hard for me to try to get along and respect my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting behind from unexpected grade changes and trying to get caught up before shift change. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you gave 110%, machine is caught up, and your co-worker walks in with a big"

good,Each day is structured in which I am always aware of the job responsibilities I must perform. I have learned that each member of the Finance Department plays an important role in the closing process at the end of the month as well as many other functions. It is imperative that everyone works together to ensure that all processes flow smoothly. The management team is comprised of men and women who are very knowledgeable about each division that they are overseeing. My co-workers are all very helpful and willing to show me new responsibilities whenever they are able to. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting positive reinforcement from my supervisor and co-workers.
