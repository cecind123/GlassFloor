good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
bad,"The work is hard but i enjoyed it. Don't trust anyone who is in management or human resources. You can work hard, never call in, do everyone else's work and then get fired based on lies. If the state couldn't find proof, clearly there is nothing to base the termination on."
bad,Worst place to work. Management is all over the place and they don’t even know what they are doing. It’s all favoritisms general manager is always in his office doesn’t even know what the machines are called but yelling at workers saying they are doing it wrong.
bad,"Worst company to work for! Too many people in management that do not have a single clue on what to do! The Human Resource department is an absolute complete joke! They can't even do their jobs! The HR department has no idea what goes on and does not care to understand both sides of any story. Too many people with no experience running million dollar equipment. This company went down hill very fast. Most of the good people left and now this company struggles to stay a float. The human resources department is VERY VERY poor within this company. They just like to hire & fire people because thats the only knowledge they have. The HR is also too lazy to do background checks and interviews on people themselves, so they hired a 3rd party on-site to do the dirty work for them! Then they wound up with all these people which didn't know the difference between a philips head and a slotted screwdriver to save their life! This company would be an excellent career path if only the right people were in management. Too many chiefs and not enough indians at this business. Most management employees at this mill have absolutely no idea on how to run a business or treat their employees. They have ""facilitators"" that do not even have a degree, but are favored employees so they get the job. They make promises they cannot keep and they lie to you! Run by a bunch of morons!"
bad,"Unprofessional, no integrity ,  would not recommend anyone this company to a vender or an individual looking for employment . It starts at the top.  Good ole boy."
bad,"Initially, was excited to work here but after a significant amount of time was disappointed. Poor management, huge corporate bureaucracy. Management will not listen to concerns or feedback. Impossible to take time off because the manpower was low. HR is incapable of doing their job. Not willing to help others. no life outside work, no flexibility in switching shifts"
bad,"The benefits and pay were decent but they over work you and treat each other like garbage. I was told a different pay rate when I interviewed than when I got the call letting me know I got the job. On the first day of employment I was investigated by management about two other employees that had got into an altercation in which I played no role in. Management was not flexible when I encountered a serious family emergency and then went back on it after I put my two-week notice in. The guy whom I took most of the direction from there would erroneously tell me to do a task and then come back and chew me out after that task had been completed. He would come into my department yelling and throwing doors as if the job itself wasn't stressful enough, much less his mistake. You are expected to do a fast-paced job on a time sensitive schedule for a job that was originally designated for two people and you are belittled if you make a rectifiable mistake, even if that mistake isn't your own. On your final day of your two-weeks they will let you go before the shift starts as a ""we let you go, not you quit on us."" I was there two months after getting hired on and while the job could have been suitable for me, I felt that I had compromised far too much for the pay and the treatment I was receiving there. Management focuses too much on what employees do outside of work and not enough on what happens on premises --> and no I never came into work hung over. Would definitely not recommend this place until they let some bad apples go."
bad,Slack lack communication skills does not pay what they say. Shows serious favoritism. They do not do what they say. They give you something to do and leave you for hours or until lunch leaving you to sit and look nuts cause you don’t know what to do after completing your tasks.
bad,This place does not challenge one's intelligence or work ethic. There is zero room for growth and the place s like  sweat shop. One does not feel as he is advancing one's career.
bad,They lie don't work for them they treat people like slaves and there very racist in the Lawrenceville location. They don't train you. If you get hurt they find a way to make you stay at work until your shift is over so you can't say you got hurt at work.
bad,They say that they are safety oriented but quite the opposite. Bad working conditions regarding facilities. They don't maintain buildings or equipment. They have a lot of safety meetings to cover themselves but then they treat adults as if children.  Overwork employees to the point that is not good safety wise and expect too much out of exhausted employees.
bad,"Since the new management began in 2008, this company was stripped if all its dignity and loyalty to its employees.  Names became numbers, the loyal were dismissed, and the managers began filling their pockets with the sweat of the those they tread upon. This company is standing at the door named KARMA."
bad,Horrible management! Horrible Pay for all the work they give you!
bad,The managers expect you not to have a personal life. They make you earn your sick days. Always switching employees to a different position without a significant pay raise or consent from employee. No policies and procedures in place.
bad,"It USED to be a good place to work. But under new management, hours and morale have gone down the tubes. There is constant lack of communication, laziness, unfairness, bad attitudes. The new plant manager has no idea how to handle serious situations. He is also very intimidated by the lazy ""bully badass"" steel yard supervisor. When 2 valuable, longtime, knowledgeable employees quit and or get fired for the smallest thing, then you know there is a problem with the joke that is upper management."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
bad,I do not have anything good to say about my time spent at CMC of Alabama.  I prefer not to discuss this time and do not wish to say anything bad about the company in tis forum.
bad,Longs days never get credit for your accomplishments and you never move up within company.  They have favorites and only those get moved up it is not what you know it is who you know.  They don't appreciate the loyal employees.
bad,"There is absolutely no room for growth here. I've seen long term employees get passed up by young, white males with little to know experience. Favoritism is everywhere. They do not promote growth nor do they reward loyalty and hard work. Management is poor at best. Lot of management, no leadership. There is such a social gap between management and ground workers that there is little communication, and absolutely no respect."
bad,"Management is selfish and inhumane.  There is no confidentiality in regard to employee salaries and personal matters. My first day on the job the executive secretary approached me on how high my salary was and informed me that it was going to rub my peers the wrong way. My supervisor was very nice to me until he discovered my salary was just a couple thousand dollars below his.  From that day, he began attempting to sabotage my sales meeting reports. The human resource department stood by their management and didn't do anything to protect me, a new employee at the time.  There is no work life balance. This company expects individuals with families to work an entire year with no PTO.  There's no sick policy, yet it is under the supervisor's discretion on what is deemed excessive."
bad,Not a good place to work for a truck driver unless you like using vacation days when it rains or when there is no work.   It’s very rare to get much overtime here contrary to what they tell you in the interview and online.   And the Dispatcher’s are almost like having a babysitter watching over you 24/7.   If you’re one of their favorites and part of the good ole CMC buddy system you’ll fit right in otherwise I’d run.
bad,Nearly everyone has the same opinion about this place. The management is horrible. The turnover rate at the Muncie location is double that of everywhere else. Management is constantly talking down to you and the environment you work in is not controlled. I have seen it 95 in the summer and negative 15 in the winter. The money can be there is you want to work your life away.
bad,"Flying objects, walking under loads is almost expected, don't accidentally get hurt cause then your the enemy and your days are numbered basicly they go against everything they preach about safety once your hired and thrown into second shift maintenance they dont care about you only getting more scrap metal shredded. And a welders nightmare when your supervisor is an electrician with no clue .rick porter"
bad,"Did not attempt to develop employees potential, no support and did not provide clear and reasonable expectations to employees.  I found the management to be very immature and lacking of any practical experience for the job in which they are tasked.  A total disappointment across the board where management is concerned.  The most frustrating five years of my life."
bad,"They want you to bust your butfor little pay, got all that money and can’t even pay us for what we are worth. If your single and like a lot of hours could be a good place to work but if you got family don’t do it. I hated just about everyday I worked there! They don’t take care of you as should point blank period!!! Mechanic even Shredder Mechanics got shatted on all the time. Managed by bunch of rookies"
bad,good company full of hardworking people . everyone has a we can accomplish everything attitude..They company is not cheap at all and will provide anything you need in order t get the job done
bad,"You have no opinion , kissing butt might get you an advancement. Lacks good leadership.  Threatens your job so employees will comply. They hire you promising every other weekend off and that's not the case."
bad,Company continues to employee managers in positions after 60% workers complants.poor H.R. response to known problems. These problems are well known to senior management but always over looked.
bad,"Maintenance does not get holidays off. Work life balance does not exist. Management is very backwards. Workers are expected to work until plant is up and running again, this can lead up to 22 hour days sometimes. Pay and bonuses are far lower than others."
bad,Worked there 35 years and let go. Not much job security. Enjoyed people I worked with. Enjoyed many of the earlier years before new management was brought in.
bad,"start and finish time great 7am-430pm, management doesnt listen to concerns of employees and makes decisions without getting all the facts. fellow employees are very nice to work with, but are alwyas on edge because the are not secure or know if they are next to be let go because of some stupid rule they decide to impliment. stay Away they have a HIGH turnover rate of employees."
bad,Mgmt will tear you down and unless you are a Male and in the click with the good ole boy system you are treated like an outsider and be set up to fail there is no guidance and they wear your self esteem down to rubble
bad,"favoritism brown nosing snitching."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
bad,My review is that i Loved my job and all the responsibilities that came with it. It was fast paced and my day flew by with all the responsibilities that came with it. There was never a dull moment. Dispatching is my passion and i know nothing else. But is's nice to receive encouraging words letting you know that you are doing an amazing job with no flaws. but the GM never reconigned you for any of the super job i did and it was hurtful but i maintained and kept performing my duties as i normally would.
bad,"As I was told by the Branch Mananger when I applied to a supervisor role. “When I give someone a job, I expect to get something out of them.” Seems more of a place to advance if you know the right people."
bad,"Work there forever and then all of a sudden HR is at your desk with your severance letter.  They screw you any way they can.  They are only worried about the bottom line.  And the Corporate incomes.  They don't touch any of their own salaries, nope just the little people that actually get work done."
bad,"check emails, dispatch to 5 other CMC yards besides mine, keep up with customers expectations on paperwork, work on freight in new system by inputting information  and printing check for that contractor, answer door and phone through out day, back up  scale and contract admin position."
bad,The company treat it's employees like slaves. You are required to work 12 plus hour per day. The salary is very low for the type of work you are required to perform on a daily basis.
bad,"Great entry level job. Shredder site. Not a place I would make a career. I learned how to run lots of equipment"
bad,If you dont decide to dedicate your whole life to this place your going to have problems. People who work there believe that there is nothing better then CMC and if you disagree you will be treated differently
bad,Doesn't have a union well underpaid compared to other steel company avg start pay is 15-16 dollars and there is no training you basically train yourself as you go company owns you once you're on the clock and off.
bad,"long hours, insufficient pay, no recognition, too much responsibility, no pay raises, management does not care about the employees, cult like culture."
bad,"Would get to work in the afternoon, recieve work orders and begin work, while working loaders puld constantly come into work station asking for material that's not even listed, then  after you oblige aand  give them what they asked for you have to worry about benders who messed up and need extra pieces. After about 3 1/2 hours you take a 30 minute lunch. After break its the same thing employees messing up and coming over for extra pieces, all the while you're fighting mosquitoes in the summer time mixed with heat, in the winter you're fighting to stay warm all night. As you're walking through the shop you have to be careful of Snakes, Racoons, and other such creatures that may be lurking in the back of the shop due to the wooded area behind the building and the docks staying open. Also most of the machines are very old and constantly in need of repair, Management still expect the same production with faulty equipment."
bad,"Typical day started at the construction trailer.  My job was to create drawings from improper drawing practices and had redraw all civil engineering plans due to improper supervision.  Mechanical Engineering was new to me, but grafted experience from past ventures."
bad,It is a terrible place to work you get treated very unfair I would strongly recommend looking at other jobs and make this your last resort the turnaround there is the highest I have ever seen constantly they hire and fire
bad,I don't enjoy working with guys that are kin to each other because they get the better jobs and never are at fault for anything they do so I wouldn't want anybody to go through what I have experienced
bad,The management time treats  you as a number. Not really  caring about you as a person or you family. It can be a really dangerous place to work and safety is not their number 1 priority.
bad,"Management would not spend time or money on their IT employee training.  If you could not use Google to find your answers or if you did not have time to train yourself on your own dime, you were not going to advance.  Poor communications throughout the workplace culture. Outsourced IT jobs whenever they could."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months, at first it wasn't bad. Being just hired, I made more than some who had been there for years, some bitterness there. Work week started on Sunday through Thursday, straight time. My father was hospitalized out of state, as I called hospital to find out. I was yelled at by the Maintenance Director to get back to work, tried to explain and was told to call them on my own time. That day, I stated looking for a new job. Wouldn't recommend unless you were desperate."
bad,"Trained to work as construction labor - supplying rebar to be made in order to be supplied to construction sites.  "
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
bad,"Mom always told me if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all."
bad,hard place to work no respect for employees no advancements
bad,"Once a great company, but in recent hard economic times and radical management changes there seems to be no vision or direction. Employee morale and trust is gone."
bad,Just be ready for racism unfairness an poor management people will make you do unsafe task there is no thing as upper management skills problems do not get solved only swept under the rug
bad,My experience with CMC as a Stand Technician is a lack of advancement in the area. Management is terrible! Too many buddy's out here so manager doesn't say anything to them about not doing their job.
bad,"No real team work, a lot of workforce flow. Not stable with company goals."
bad,"poor ventilation(lots of smoke from welding)shop area very dirty do to the operators lack of house keeping.poor management do not follow up on concerns from employees.dont care attitudes,your problem not mine."
bad,Management sucks they penny pinch you when it comes to raise.. sometimes they put getting the job done over safety.. if you get a job on the furnace be ready to within 700 degree furnace to maintain contour of the furnace
bad,"Large corporations suck! Small fab shops are better run.  If you don't mind having 10 levels of management above you making a whole lot more money and knowing nothing about rebar, go for it!"
bad,"10/12 hr day."
bad,This company isn't that great to work for. Benefits are minimal and the management doesn't really care about the people there. They do not protect the employees or help them if they are making a move that is not in their best interest. They are unfair in their policies regarding ending employment or bonuses.
bad,"If you are not attractive or into hunting or fishing, you are considered an outcast & treated unfairly & forgotten about. Management believes  the world revolves around them & thinks everything needs to be their way."
bad,"When I started out, I was basically left on my own with very little assistance or interactive training which hindered my learning.There was lots of micromanaging regarding training & you could tell they had no idea how to properly train a new employee. Weeks & months went by & I still had not learned how to properly do my job. It was not a good experience by far."
bad,"I worked there, ended up quitting. This company is unbelievably disorganized, the culture is like middle school. If you're a good ole boy you will be fine. If you want to work and get things done, then stay away."
bad,"The poeple dont take job safety serious but i learned a highly skilled trade by operating heavy equipment and how to drive simi ,dump trucks"
bad,A lot to learn with company but definitely have their favorites . Gives decent pto weekly but still gets counted against you when you call out due to medical emergency.
bad,The mill is super hot during the summer reaching around 140F+ degrees. The work is hard and the equipment is heavy. The good news is that you'll sleep good every night because you'll be so dang exhausted and dehydrated.
bad,"Shifts are on a rotation between 4 crews. "
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
bad,"As difficult as is it to hire on pay should be better. Equipment is good. Good safety program. Dispatch can be diificult to deal with. Bonuses, health insurance and 401k is the best thing going on here."
bad,"Many Employees do not maintain proper professionalism, resulting in false accusations against fellow employees.  Management has a history of not taking action until HR becomes involved.  Victims are punished.  Not a valued place to work."
bad,"I picked up all scrap tickets from the scale house each day.  There would be at lease 30 shipments that needed to be paid for that morning.  By 9am I had invoiced all shipments.  I processed other invoices and resolved discrepancies.  I also processed requisitions for the buyer. "
bad,"This place is like a middle school, it's ridiculous how childish people behave."
bad,This is an absolutely massive company with the ability to offer great benefits. If you are a high health risk or planning your retirement then this is the place for you. The opportunities for advancement are few so the competition makes for a poor culture and a cut-throat environment. The pay is very low and transfers must be approved by your immediate supervisor which is inconvenient if the reason you want the transfer is because of your current supervisor.
bad,"I worked there for 6 months."
bad,"I was told to ask questions, that everyone was friendly and would help you out. If you see something you think can be improved to bring it up. From my experience this is not the case, As an electrician being hired on you will be told you will be doing preventative Maintenance what they mean is you will be cleaning a glorified janitor that can enter Mcc's and transformer vaults so you can clean the same places every week this is your hob."
bad,"Never felt I fit in. Little direction, no sales territory, each sales manager was competing for same business. Little if any team collaboration. Pay scale was competitive and benefits were good. Worked for division maybe parent company operated differently, but my division was a very unhealthy environment especially for new hires."
bad,"Working there is okay. relatively easy. Once you are there, you are there. The work life balance is horrible. Very dirty environment. Early mornings and late nights. Rough working conditions. Good people."
bad,While working i had full experience on everything and worked very hard. The job was very repetitive and dangerous because of the sharp steal. I didnt feel like i was getting paid enough for my experience and capabilities. The employer's i worked for were very negligent so i had to quit.
bad,"Job was dirty, low pay, had to work double and triple hours just to make my bills. I would not recommend this place for employment. Management doesn't really care about people."
bad,"work long shifts"
bad,CMC was a very busy place the management team was overall good but the employees did not really care about accuracy and getting the work completed on time which means someone was always late producing the work for the clients.
good,No one speaks english here other people make mistakes and you get blamed for them.
good,"I worked in the wire chopper as a forklift operator and every time a higher paying position opened they hired out of company instead of promoting loyal, already employed, workers. With the exception of one guy who was a supervisors relative, who was promoted in only 3 months. I worked 6 days a week 5am-5pm. My supervisor never talked to me with respect. Would order me to sweep and bring him stuff all the time. Never asked, always ordered. Non climate controlled. No restrooms, only portapoties."
good,"Hostile work environment.  Favoritism shown toward CEO's ""buddies"".  Limited guidance and training from the corporate office.  Upper management quick to throw employees under the bus."
good,"my job in particular was fine.  a job that does not get micro managed.  "
good,"Jobs have too short of time frame and too little money. Mistakes are made and problems occur. There is no congratulations on a job well done, but definitely criticism & yelling if there are problems."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,Typical work day is very stressful.  Great company to work for. Just the management team.  You only promoted if management likes you not by the knowledge you have in the company.
good,"constant senior mgt changes, Senior mgt seemed to get changed every 4 weeks, safety was not a concern, constant on the job Injuries with no consequences to leadership"
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to work on the equipment, to make improvement. No support or backing from Supervisor. The work was fun and interesting but manager would lie and manipulate information."
good,"Conflict of interest . They treat you good if you are friend or family. The buddy system and who you know. Work hard and be punctual and available, none of that matters if your not in the in."
good,"It's a fast-paced environment where work-load can be very heavy.  Depending on your role and department, work/life balance can be nonexistent.  Growth and advancement opportunities can be difficult to find. "
good,"On the surface the CMC organization looks well established, organized, and standardized.  The larger parent organization is, the small subsidiaries are not.  The Construction services group requires rebuilding, and there isn't a unified mechanism to allow this to happen.  This group needs a solid foundation including policies and procedures to guide them."
good,Very  unorganized company  The CEO and it up spending more time or are you in with the customers which I thought was wrong  The job good pay well but they management was very on organized never knew when you were going to work again
good,Hard work with low pay. It's a great skill to learn but not enough money to survive with a family. Little to no raises everyone year. Not good job security
good,Management came from outside and quickly took the environment downhill from there.  A great company for collaboration quickly became a back stabbing environment
good,Cmc is a good company but the shop manager didnt want to let people move up in the company. They have good benefits and time off all thats lacking is the opportunity for people to move up in the company
good,"Have plenty of information and access to learning about rebar, fabrication and scraping metals. My experience is over a 5 year span and I've learned how the company makes a difference across the world."
good,commercial metals if full of good people to work with . the hours due tend to be demanding at times being it is a 24/7 steel business but it is enjoyable and rewarding at times when you do get recognized.
good,"I love who I work with. The company is going through a lot of changes, mainly with system implementations. Not many people trust management anymore with some of the decisions they have made. For example, with one of the systems being implemented, they started off too fast with go-lives without allowing sufficient time to fix issues. This allows the problems to compound and forces people to work long hours to get the job done right. Thankfully, I have not been caught up in this... yet. They are starting to ask that people work on weekends during month end close, and I would rather spend time with my family. With another system implementation, management didn't first listen that it would not work for our inventory needs, and therefore we had to take the test location off of this new system and back on the old one. Then we had to reimplement the new system once the kinks were worked out."
good,It’s an ok place to work if looking for just another job. If your looking for a career this is not the company for you because there is no moving up anytime a good position came available instead of promoting someone with experience they hire someone off the street. The equipment constantly breaks down and it is a fast paced working environment so it’s hard to get your job done when you don’t have good working equipment. There’s too many chiefs and not enough Indians on the yard as well everyone thinks they are your boss. The yard supervisor was the only person there I had respect for he was truly a great guy and he does care about the employees.
good,This job is for people that really need money and does not mind being away from their families for long periods of time. the pay is great and benefits.
good,Its cutting back on hours. Management  aint good at all. The pay is alright.  Need better management.  They very good  on safety. Don't keep employees on what's goihh
good,This job requires very long hours and at very fast pace.There equipment is pretty good in most cases and if need they will fix the problems.This is a good place to learn the rebar industry.
good,Company has great intention and a vision to become a leader in their field. However company does not do a very good job of recognizing and cultivating employees strengths or have career plans for employee growth.
good,"cmc was the ideal place to work. at this point management needs to change. the morale is low and this will eventually drive the safety culture, production and a host of other things down"
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,The job its self was not bad at all; the working hours were great and very compatible with home life/ work balance; the management at the site I worked at was very poor.
good,"On my last day, my boss came into my office, saw me taking my degree off the wall and said, ""You have an MBA?"" They have essentially no idea what they're doing there."
good,I had a good time meeting and relating to alot of great people at CMC recycling but the hazardous materials and work environment was too much to worry about on a daily basis.
good,"I would have to attend daily meetings and keep notes over what was talked about. I learned how to work several different systems such as SAP, ASA, and Peach Tree."
good,"It was an interesting job, it is a recycling plant and I had to deal with all sorts of personalities from customers. I learned a lot about recycling and the different grades of metals. My co-workers were good people."
good,"I loved working for Commercial Metals Company until the 2009 global recession began. Working there didn't really seem like work. My manager was wonderful. When the recession hit, CMC began a series of reductions in force that cleaned out most everyone that was close to retirement along with their assistants. Most of these people had been with CMC for 20 years or longer. It was horrible to watch these dedicated employees being tossed aside like yesterday's trash."
good,"Selective with education/development opportunities"
good,A good place to learn and advance your skills. Throughout the 9 years I’ve been with the company I was able to learn and advance my troubleshooting skills and advance my career.
good,"Waited 5 months to get to hired , they said it was based on how i work. i learned two more machines and still wasnt hired on . i got no paid holidays like everyone no benefits."
good,"For employees in production & maintenance, and sales:"
good,"It was a lot of hard work with a swing shift where everyone works a few days and a few nights every week.  It was rather hard to get used to, after three years of working there, I don't think that I ever did."
good,It was a very productive work place but there just not enough help to get what we needed done done so therefore we got behind and had to work the weekends
good,In my opinion this job does not care about there workers in no kind of way it's hot nosie and the pay is not good your schedule changes every week the supervisor don't like to help out on the floor
good,When CMC Construction Services was its own independent entity it was a great place to work. Unfortunately in an effort to save money and because of bitter upper management it was taken over by the corporate office in Irving. Corporate wanted to change everything that was successful about the company and streamline and make everything cookie cutter. They also proceeded to lay off plenty of people in an effort to ship jobs to India.
good,"A physically demanding workplace environment. Extreme temperature conditions and very dirty. "
good,worked sucked and couldnt understand anyone there. training was good and cared about safety and production number. they didnt care about replaceable non speaking english employees and especially didnt like fact whites and blacks worked there
good,"a typical day at work includes working as a team to get orders completed. I learned how to assemble various dowel baskets."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,Not very good job security. Occasional company trips. Occasional free lunches.
good,It was a good experience and good learning enviroment for young guy just getting into the field. co workers are helpful .and can teach you the do and dont of working in a live plant.
good,Very busy daily w lots of demands that need to be met daily. A great place to work w great management depending on location. Easy to work up and get promoted within the company.
good,Good working environment steady work even when it's raining and cold you would always have a job doing something understanding if you needed to take time off if you showed up to work
good,This place is a good place to work but the benefits are not good. They pay is poor also. Management is good and cooperative. The work environment is safe.
good,Its a good company to work with very relaxed its a good place.        To work amd very boring routine you can work and do nothing at the same time good
good,"Great company with solid leadership.  Lots of opportunity to grow however it is a big company and things can change quickly.  This can mean layoffs, job changes, or relocation."
good,The culture changed from being friendly and collaborative to political and elitist. As in every company the department that you work plays a big part in the culture so ask questions during interviews to the hiring manager.
good,direct management needs to be changed and more focuse on people company has great intensions but the cayce location needs to make some changes before everyone leaves
good,"It is a very enjoyable office. I liked how they made everyone feel relax and welcomed. Good place to work, and a lot of space to grow. I really liked a lot working in this place"
good,I was a welder here for about 6 months. Its hard to find a good helper here but when you do you can be very productive and stand out above the others. Theres a certain footage required to build and weld up everyday. If you can meet that number nobody usually messes with you.
good,"The company used to be a great company to work for because it cared about its employees jobs.  Now they are looking for any reason to let go of people.  Compensation used to be great, they have looked to cut down on bonus and wages.  They are good on safety, but they have over done the safety rules in order to not give employees second changes to learn."
good,"we worked hard but we had fun. learned how to weld. the work place was great attitude was crazy. hardest part of the lob was getting there, the most enjoyable part was the company parties."
good,Ok work environment but with the low pay there is not enough incentive to advance. Long hours. Good people though. Monday through Friday and holidays off. No sick days. Limited vacation.
good,Opened the store. Assist customers and help restock shelves. great location. plenty of places to go for lunch. Great coworkers. company picnics were always fun.
good,"I had 9 great years with the company, until I was transferred last year to another department which was unstable. I started disliking my job last year."
good,"Very quiet place to be, as well as very few coworkers. Small office setting but with few workers everyone is spread out. Good people to work with though."
good,"This company has been around for over 100 years which is reflected heavily by their highly dated management practices. Many of the widely used methods such as Just in Time stocking, 6 Sigma, The Toyota Process or even 5S are no where to be found. So much money could be saved by eliminating unused stock and using some sort of tracking and accountability. Preventative Maintenance is non existent and costs the company both time and extra money. The hours are great however with the 4 10 hour day schedule with overtime on Friday."
good,"Its fast pace environment. Working and interacting can be challenging at times, but ones you establish a relationship it becomes joyful."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"CMC puts safety first. You get out of it what you put into it. Work hard, earn respect and climb the ladder to success."
good,Always something to learn but not much room for advancement due to size of company. Safety culture is there. Good place for someone to start out to learn the structural industry.
good,A typical work day at CMC was back and forth for the most part. Management would send down of list of things that we needed to complete but it would change every other hour. Meaning we would never get anything accomplished because we never get the chance to. I think if we had good management things would be a lot better.
good,"Not particularly challenging, but a good office life was present. The work was honestly somewhat lack-luster however."
good,"Enjoyed working there but there was a lot of favoritism from managers to employees, but an overall good job."
good,"Its a hard working job and decent pay and benifits, It's just not the job for me."
good,"CMC Recycling was a good place to work. Things were sometimes slow, but I had things to keep me busy. I made several friends and I was sad to leave when my time as a temp was over."
good,"Over the years, the atmosphere changed. The people were always great and a joy to work for but management changed."
good,"really miss working with coworkers, had to make unexpected move. i would refer this company to anyone."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that I know it very well and get along great with my co-workers.
good,A lot of hours per work with high production expectations.  Good leadership but very short staffed.  Room for growth but must be dedicated.  Not a lot of leeway for attendance
good,"Great corporation, great benefits cheap insurance no weekends you get to love what you do good guys  "
good,"morale was down since new CEO came in.  This was previously a great company but now only focuses on dollars, not people.  Her meetings now sound like a MAGA campaign commercial"
good,Hot environment but if you are looking for advancement in the company... maybe not the best option.... I would consider going back to work there for job security but nothing more.
good,A typical day at CMC Recycling is never the same.  Your hours per week and job duties vary on a daily basis.  Management is very subpar.  Certain supervisors have their favorite employees and treatment of employees isn't always fair.  You do learn to operate multiple types of equipment and the benefits are satisfactory.
good,"very demanding workplace physically and mentally. great atmosphere and good co-workers. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning more everyday. the weather played apart when it was cold it was cold and when it was hot it was hot,"
good,This company was a great place to work. My normal day of work was to take an inventory of the steel we had on hand and order more when needed.
good,"process weekly and biweekly payroll"
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,10 hour work day
good,Hard place to work because everyone who works there got their job because their dad worked there or their grandfather worked there so no one is really in love with their job nor are they really qualified.
good,Not too much room for advancement as there aren't many positions available to move into. Safety became an issue as personnel were asked to do jobs that they were not qualified to do. Equipment maintenance was overlooked to keep up production
good,Good over all job just to slow paced for me. I have learned more about the products involved in the concrete aspect of construction and what all is required for all the different processes.
good,Good place to work. Good people with many different cultures. Hardest part of the job was the drive for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the the customers and the co-workers.
good,This was a temp to possible hire position.  I helped get their SAP in maintenance online and information put into system.  Loved working with the maintenance guys.
good,The job has decent benefits but the wages are sub par for the industry average. Fails to pay people what they are worth and lose great employees to other jobs.
good,"Good company for training, incentives, pay, decent benifits;"
good,"daily work routine for different customer, great place to work and learned different stuff everday"
good,"Start work at 06:15, 3 meetings by 07:30. Put out any fires that occurred in the last 16 hours. Complete PM's and jobs scheduled for the day."
good,A typical day at work would be having to stay engaged on what you are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the workers are very friendly.
good,"Everyone is very friendly and helpfull. I enjoy going to work everyday. Some days are more difficult than others depending on breakdowns. The only downside is you are micromanaged everyday, it is a very dusty, greasy and wet environment."
good,"A typical day includes working with individuals and large companies with purchasing their scrap metals. I am in outside 30% of the day (rain, sleet, or snow) to inspect and classify various types of metals. "
good,"Typical day consisted of operating heavy machinery, fabricating metal, and pulling orders."
good,Supported by Supervisory Staff.  Safety was important.  Benefits were great.  Incentives were given out monthly.  Opportunity for advancement for those who are willing to work hard.
good,It could be a great place to work if they actually put saftey over production. Its rotating shifts one week nights one week days m-f sometimes saturday. If they would mimic the rest of the plant instead of Management setting thier own hours that they dont have to work to see how hard it is to flip sleep. Its not safe flipping your hours of sleep every week. Two weeks would be much better then weekly. They have a saying of keep it running. And thats regardless how safe it is as long as it is running. We have the highest injury rate in all of CMC which trickles down from the main man Alan Jackson. High turnover rate due to the foremans attitude even the supervisors are quitting. People dont quit jobs they quit management.
good,We had some of the best days there but I started this job when I first got out of high school and the working conditions was poor but it was a job that I really needed to pay my bills.
good,A pleasant place to work if your a self motivated person. High paced and always moving but it makes the day pass fast. It is a market driven company so hours may very as market declines. Over all a great company that takes cate of its employees.
good,"A typical day working at Commercial Metals is different than a typical day at other places. Some days I work during the AM hours, other days I work during the PM hours. "
good,I enjoyed working at cmc. Everyday was a definite challenge since all that was going on was production but that was the nature of the beast. Management personnel very much on the ball.
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"Dangerous. Extremely hazardous environment, both physically and mentally. Random days that never end. nobody knows how long shifts will be, inventory continues until decided otherwise which is between 12-20 hour days then back to it at 7 am the next day."
good,It was a fun work place with every day learning and doing something you never thought you could do. Pushing to the limit at all times. Being able to know that you always have help and some one watching your back for safety.
good,"Started work at 7AM and clocked out at 4.30Pm.Started out the day with checking open invoices and researching invoices to compare the actual cost of services. Ordered trailers for shipping and set up rail cars for the week. I always did different jobs depending where I was needed."
good,"Got to work before 8am to start the day by checking over my crane and making sure it would be ready for a full day of loading and unloading material to be sent off and processed."
good,"Good company to work for. Good pay, but promotions are very hard to come by. Management systems are always in a tift to see who's to blame instead of how to fix and prevent further problems"
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for.  After being here for almost 12 years, you become like family. The hardest part of the job is when you are swamped with work and there are other employees ""goofing off"" when they can offer assitance."
good,"Received customer ticket did payout by cash / check. Ordered supplies, helped in sales, filed tickets throughout the day, filed paper work. I did daily closeout / order money and closed out end of day."
good,Good company to work for. Especially young single men. Hard for single parent. Strict attendance policy. Very hot and dangerous environment. Safety is primary concern of management.
good,"Perform maintenance on tractor trailers, various types of cranes."
good,The company has recently passed its centennial mark and is still moving forward in its industry. They have various business world wide. The culture is growing and that is what will continue to make a world of difference in its growth.
good,"Overall CMC is a good company to work for. Due to the corporate structure, they are very slow to react. CMC also has a difficult time keeping up with today's changes, i.e. technology, career opportunities, training, etc."
good,"You work in very hot areas."
good,Buena compañía muchas áreas para aprender y desarrollar habilidades
good,"Good place to work. Most people that work there have been there for years. Management was fair. The hours were long. No set time to leave, and the pay was really low for the type of work your doing."
good,Good company to work for to start out. Takes a long time to work your way up within the company with low compensation of work. Will learn alot about product and applications for that product
good,hard work place in some uncomfortable environments. but learned a whole lot and I am thankful for the experience. hardest part of the job is not hurting yourself
good,"I picked up all scrap tickets from the scale house each day. There would be at lease 30 shipments that needed to be paid for that morning. By 9am I had invoiced all shipments. I processed other invoices and resolved discrepancies. I also processed requisitions for the buyer. "
good,A great place to learn and advance your career. Learn and grow.
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"buy scrap material from customers"
good,A typical day at work is driving for 8-10 hours a day.
good,"I enjoyed my time at CMC as a driver. They promoted a safe work environment and co-workers were always ready to help. Although the work was steady, the trucks were old and the pay was on the lower scale of driver pay."
good,"In the mill it can be a pretty harsh place to get your body used to, but you are surrounded by workers and managers that will make sure you are well taken care of."
good,"This can be an unsafe place. Be careful. Most of the Management is good. I just happen to have a really bad one. There are many cliques, so you must fit in too stay. Also, they are very strict about being on time so plan to get there early. They pay pretty well and have benefits."
good,Was a great place to work when I started there. It has tappered off as the years have gone by. And the health insurance has gone down the drain. It was good when I started there and now it is base line.
good,"Good, global organizational. Good benefits package, makes an effort to maintain competitive in industry with trainings. Willing to change for the better,"
good,cmc is a great place to work In a regular day I would typically pull orders for customers I pulled about 50 + orders per day. I learned about different constrcution materials and the use of them.
good,"After working at CMC for approximately 17 years, I have found that CMC is  good place to work at. The company has many benefits and opportunities, but it did not work out for me. The shift work was the hardest to deal with but the people that work there are awesome."
good,"loading rebar on trucks and into bin locations with crane or forklift, safety is key, management is ok  that is all i can say about that, good men hard working men, 12hr days working night and days week ends, getting the job done safety."
good,"Cmc Commercial Metals was a great company to be apart of. I learn to operate  several overhead production cranes, some welding experience and experienced whats its like to work in very high temperature conditions .(over 2000 degrees Farenheit)"
good,"Long hours ,High turn around of people. Have a lot of good resources. It was Hot in the Summer and cold in the winter. Good benifits. Management was well trained."
good,"Job was decent. Very busy, very long hrs.. the money was ok..I really dont have any major problems with management. I had to relocate due to my father terminal illness. Pay can be better. Started at 18 hr"
good,Good place to work there is room for advancement .12hr shifts. Plenty of days off to make up for the long days. Supervisor are good some of the workers are idiots.
good,Cmc is a great company to work for.  With ample opportunities to grow and advance. Iron work is a very hard career to go into but I had a new family and I had to do what had to be done.
good,"The work environment is something to get used too, it’s not for everyone. Be willing to work and they will work with you in anyway they can. Overall good experience"
good,its a good place to work. just need more money for the stuff you do out there. when its time for the annually raise they penny pinch you. been here 5 years all I got for a raise all together $1.67.
good,"Rotation schedule with 12 hour days. Really good benefits: Medical, dental, vision, Health Savings accounts, 401k, stock options. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Commercial Metals Company (CMC).  I worked in the south Texas region as an estimator.  The employees were very friendly and had numerous years of combined experience in rebar fabrication and running an industrial steel shop.  The shop was a small location, so it was difficult to work your way up the career ladder without moving to a new area.  I was never bored as the work was always there."
good,"Good place to work as long as you are committed to the company.  Many times, work was asked to come before anything else.  Can be challenging as long as you are actively engaged."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"Commercial Metals is a great place to work.  Your objectives are known and you are fairly rewarded for your accomplishments.  Accountability is a key area of focus and it is enforced fairly across all employees."
good,CMC is a company which has been around for over 100 years and isn't going anyway anytime soon. They are a very large company with a small company feel.
good,CMC takes care of it's employees and is very loyal. Job security is paramount there. The office is very laid back and you're given the flexibility to do your job without being micromanaged.
good,"This was a great place to work, if you don't mind doing the same job for years on end.  Room for advancement was never based on what you know, but who you know.  Their pay is good, but not as competitive as others in the industry."
good,"Company takes very good care of employees.  Purchases fresh fruit, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. in order to promote hydration.  Frequently provides meals, snacks, and donuts. Open door policy with management.   Small number of employees means that your voice can easily be heard."
good,I absolutely loved working with the Engineering Department. I was able to get my hands on a little bit of everything and there was not a single person who hesitated helping me out.
good,this job is being a crane operator to clean and cut the metals and putting them into the train so that they can be shipped to were they need to be shipped.
good,"Great place to work, awesome employees, great benefits and decent pay.If the plant had not shut down i would likely still be working there."
good,"Safe company that has great benefits, safety lunches, PTO  programs and holiday parties. Fun place to work with advancement opportunities. Business is good when the metal market is up. When prices are low, business is slow and can get boring."
good,I learned about the structure side of building America. I worked side by side with a wonderful group of guys. The most important message and goal of each day was to make sure we went home safe to our families.
good,"Big company with lots of room to expand, grew way too quick and took on too much work. The staff and management were great to work for, and the company treated you well."
good,"This is a steel mill. If you don't mind working in a super hot, dirty, smoke filled, loud environment with hands on physical labor, then this may be the perfect place for you. They do take care of people, esp. hourly. They get the concept that nothing can happen without the people who perform the job. Compensation and bonus for hourly and management are excellent. Career advancement is not so good. Promotions are given based on retire or die for hourly and the good old boy system for management. Overall, I learned alot about business and lean principles while working here."
good,"Best part of the job is that it was fast pace, challenging and a positive environment to work in."
good,"I personally loved my job.It was challanging,every day brought new challenges with the variety of machinery and the age of some of them.I learned another level of patience.At times the hours were long but always felt a sense of accomplishment there was somethingabout seeing the end product bent ,cheered, and loaded on trailorst"
good,"The production team is fantastic and has a good employee culture.  Good company to work for.   Should be prepared to be challenged with the environment, but definitely has career potential."
good,"This would be an excellent company for permanence. Excellent crew to work with. Tight budgets, but respectful timelines good management and avg work-life balance for IT."
good,Worked in a large 3 story metal building with no AC. Depending on the metal material we were working with that day it could get very dusty and dirty. You have to get your hands dirty at times but with good teamwork things could go smoothly.
good,"My time at CMC was only as a temporary employee.  Yet, I had a positive experience there and would have enjoyed getting to learn more about the CMC culture and employees."
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"Too much corporate interferences, not focused enough on growing sales. Too focused on managing the sales team and not giving the freedoms of growing sales."
good,Sometimes work instructions are not clearly understood. CMC has taught me much in the last 5 years. how to handle situations and get quick responses to breakdowns.
good,I enjoyed working at CMC because of the work environment and management. They treated you like family and really cared for their employees. I was taught a lot about inside sales and how to maintain inventory and the ordering process. I also had a big hand in maintaining good relationships with some of the accounts. Product knowledge was very important so I learned how to study about the products and apply that knowledge to the sales part of my job.
good,I had a good manager and helpful people that I worked with on a daily basis.  Really pushed the whole teamwork aspect of the business.  I could walk in to any of the managers offices and have a conversation about the business or personal matters.
good,Overall it is a good place to work. It is somewhat family oriented. The benefits are average but ultimately my feelings with the company are unsatisfied because of certain leadership.
good,This is a company who still looks out for their employees.  Have to be able to wear many hats and multi task.  Good work / home balance.  Compensation and benefits are good.
good,"Three matters to keep in mind when considering CMC as a potential employer:"
good,"Fast pace, fun good management . Mgt very supportive. Good pay and benefits. Good location. Stressful at times but coworkers always willing to help.  Good teamwork."
good,"It was an fun place to work at. It had its days where things were up and down but overall, it's Great. I can't say no more about it. It was an very fun experience for me."
good,Creo que esta muy bien en informarles mi manera de trabajar
good,great place to work for busy during summer slow in winter but great environment great employees and great safety everyone gets along great with great learning experience
good,CMC was a great place of employment.  There were a lot of attributes working for this company.  I was able to learn valuable lesson in time management. Engaging with the various vendors and branch managers to fulfill my job duties was most rewarding.
good,learning all type of things about  rebar testing and doing bend test  bar and running all type of tools i like working with my hands thus was one of the best jobs i have had
good,"I have worked for the company for many years even after it was bought by another. I watched the highs and lows, close friends leave. Things changed there are pros and cons either way but I am grateful for the 30 years of service for this company, we were a family I will never forget. The job is hard labor, I have had really HOT days in the furnace and easy going days in office. We worked as a team because safety is first. Assessments of how well the team worked together for the ultimate success was taken monthly. Suggestions for better harmony among my team was taken into consideration/addressed. Management gave feedback frequently to help with productivity. Learned skills such as: Monitors and measures billets, Torchman, Supervise and maintain alloys, the list can go on and on. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done at the end of the day."
good,fun envirnment and management definitley showed appreciation towards employees with lunch and activities. great hours and good pay and benefits
good,"Very good company to work for, learned a lot the time I was there."
good,Open the warehouse at 7:00. I learned how to be a good leader shown by example. Management was pretty easy to work with as long as the day to day warehouse operations were running well.got to teach my warehouse personal how to run a well organized safe work environment. having to let someone go because their work ethics weren't up to standards. was able to run the warehouse how i see fit.
good,Loved working there.  Great people.  Worked 65-70 per week for almost 7 years..
good,I learned to operate a crane very quickly and different areas within the plant
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,Good company with good benefits. There's also some opportunities within the company if you look hard enough.
good,The company has a lot of opportunities to grow. This specific Las Vegas branch would not be the case though as the market is very narrow. Very laid back work environment.
good,"Very diverse workplace, help customers load material on to carts, grade material in touch screen computer system, sort material once weighed in, knowing knowledge of different types of materials/metals/aluminums, hardest part of the job is the weather especially working in Texas you never know what’ll get, most enjoyable part of the work day is interacting w/coworkers as well as customers."
good,"I love my job here at CMC. Great pay with benefits. We work 12 hour shifts that rotate from days to nights. Sometime that's hard to get use to. So if you like great pay with, you'll like it here."
good,"Over all a great place for electricians to learn and get a good start on their careers but watch out for management, they like to play games with people when they get bored."
good,Company had great benefits and time off after your 90 days. Fast paced work environment. The job is very hard physically. The job does require you to have knowledge in repair of the company equipemnt
good,"Working at Commercial Metals has been a great place to increase my knowledge in a number of different things like: Capitol Expense planning, Business planning, financial reporting, and human resources. The day always goes by faster than expected due to the face pace business. From dealing with customer needs/complaints, to assisting team members to broaden their horizon to advance with in the company it was defiantly a job that I enjoyed."
good,"CMC is a great place to work some of the management are not what CMC  need to make the company  successful as need to be, If they are going to play bye the book do it for everyone not just some are have favoritism toward certain people ."
good,"Would still be there if they had not closed down the company"
good,"Great Place to work, always busy, time flew by, overtime daily, piece rate with bonus was mostly good, was only laid off twice in 16 years"
good,"There were times when the job was very stressful, trying to get subcontractors to keep enough workers on job and to be on time themselves. Keeping the main suppliers of critical products and or equipment moving along on an orderly fashion, making deadlines."
good,Company as a whole was good.  The division (metal recycling) I worked in was mostly well led.  Industry is extremely competitive with many markets overcrowded.  Experienced employees are necessary to run a good business and in some locations it is difficult to source either people with the skill sets necessary for long term success and/or difficult to pay them what they are worth.
good,I love helping the customers and I am really good with numbers so I really enjoyed this job.
good,"Process payroll and payroll taxes"
good,"On a typical day at Cmc Recycling, we would clock in, meet and talked about safety and prevention. Stretch and flex, go to our stations perform our duties. Clean the plant before leaving"
good,I didn't want to leave this company but I had better job offers to use my CDL again. I was treated right and learned alot In the scrap business. Good company for anyone to work for.
good,Rotating shifts from week to week. Hardworking throughout each shift. Had to keep up production quotas and keep orders flowing with time constraints. Could be stressful if you were being schedule on the body and mind.
good,I worked on assembly line and worked in welding. I worked with approx15-30 people on the line. I did not have any attendance issues and was never written up for my performance.
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,Professional international company with a reputation for safety. They place a premium on safety because employees are working with dangerous equipment.  The bottom line is that if you do your job they will reward you.
good,It’s was a little under paying but the work definitely keeps you in shape and goin. Also it motivates you to do more with great coworkers and the environment .
good,Work environment at CMC Construction was self-directed. Daily meeting was for purpose of providing management with status summaries of current jobs and to choose new jobs from the list of available jobs. Assignments were not micro-managed - each employee worked at his/her own pace to complete assigned tasks.
good,"CMC was the height of my business career, and the best place I have ever worked.  However, due to the economic slump and the President we had at the time cutting off all funding for roads and bridges it brought the business to its' knees and they had to conduct lay offs.  I was hit by lay off # 4.  I am not bitter about that, I was given a very good exit package (which is unheard of these days).  I really wish I could go back!"
good,The work environment at CMC is fast paced while keeping an eye out for safety. The hours are terrible but the overtime was helpful. I learned a lot about the rebar making process.
good,Great starter job but not much room for advancement. Super visors are really great and very understanding about life situations. Some of the jobs were physically demanding and can take it's toll on the body.
good,Real great place to start work the next day been there two years love the job but it’s time for more advancements. Recommend Cmc in San Marcos to amazing management
good,"Very safe place to work, very family oriented with friendly faces all over the plant that want to get to know you. Although it's a steel mill, I would recommend anyone start out with Commercial Metals."
good,Job is great and so are the people. Pays fantastically and the benefits are amazing. They work great around your schedule as long as you don’t abuse it.
good,"go to work, put on PPE and open scales. assist clients in getting metals sorted and on to scale. keep warehouse clean and organised using heavy equipment."
good,I loved working there there is always room for advancement and it's a place where you live going in to work they are you with respect and know how to treat their employees
good,"Provides all necessary training needed to perform well at job tasks.  Great place to work and very quiet within the office.  As long as your proficient with basic math and AutoCAD, you should be fine."
good,There wasn't too much room to grow with the company. The upside was that they paid you pretty good. The insurance & health benefits were very nice. Good job
good,Good rewarding work. You get what you put into it. Lots of room for advancement and company goes out of their way to make sure everyone is safe and happy.
good,"Started our safety meeting at 6:45am/pm sharp. Shift began at 7:00/am/pm sharp. I would walk up a few stories of stairs to my overhead crane. I would use my hooks simultaneously to lift 125 ton buckets full of various metals to dump into the large furnace. I would also lift forklifts, materials and various other stuff in between the two charges. When operations were not as smooth I would help below with labor as in sweeping and shoveling. Hot environment and not for the weak."
good,Employee driven Behavior Based Safety Culture worked to lower incident frequency by more than 50% over several years.
good,you can learn a lot with this company. there world wide and benefits are good also. wouldn't mind working for thee again. the jobsite I worked at got shutdown cause they were real slow that's the only reason I am not still with them.
good,C M C provides a well rounded culture of excellence. Their family oriented value make working there a plus. Pay is fair but you receive a lot overtime. Their advancement program is good. I learned a lot about shipping from a My supervisor stand point. I really enjoyed the company competitive atmosphere.
good,"Commercial Metals is an excellent place to work. Allowing for new ideas to be exercised and always promoting internally. Excellent safety culture, and training."
good,"I would arrive at the job site 15 minutes prior to clock in time, which was usually 2 P.M. for my shift. After clocking in, us employees were given a safety briefing and given a scope of the work for that particular day. All tasks were completed and any additional work that was required was also addressed. Certification on specific machinery, forklift, safety, welding and bending. Management was safety conscious and eager to educate and advance employees in a reasonable time frame, but tended to pick favorites. There were both long and short term employees that were eager to be ""team players"" and always willing to lend a helpful hand. Inclimate weather conditions and pinpoint accuracy of the task at hand was the most difficult part of the job. Working alongside my colleagues and furthering my knowledge of the job with possible promotions in mind."
good,"I am enjoying my opportunity here at CMC. I had no idea when I was hired that I would love coming to work everyday. My co-workers make the day go by quickly. I am able to communicate not only with my coworkers here at my location but I am able to communicate with those out in the field as well. Everyone is such a pleasure. While we are all focused on core business needs, there is no time for negativity or unpleasantness. I admire our workers in the field who put their heart and soul into the steel manufacturing business. This is not easy work. I feel CMC is dedicated to it's employees and their career goals.  "
good,Solid company with a good culture and plenty of opportunities.  Great benefits including tuition reimbursement and excellent healthcare.
good,"A normal day consisted of morning stretches a safety meeting then a normal flood of customers buying material to start their day."
good,This is a really good company. I worked hard and they paid good! Management is really good too! I enjoyed this job because I was able to get work done and have fun!
good,Working here was a great learning experience. I had a great boss and wonderful coworkers. I learned so much working here.
good,Typical day at work was very challenging. Co-workers were very friendly & helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was my performance.
good,this was very exciting work for me. I learned a lot about the line of work and wish they would call me back..

What I learned from CMC was how to operate in a safe manner various forklifts, semi truck, and propane torch. The work place culture was fast paced and easy-going. The hardest part of the job was the 60 hour weeks. The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the benefits and overtime."
good,"A wonderful company where I could use my Auto-Cad skills everyday. It was fast paced with quick deadlines which sometimes caused a stressful environment. The people were wonderful to work with although the lines of communication between drafting and fabricating changed constantly. So it was often difficult to determine what management needed and who was directing. I felt management was lacking. However, I loved the work and would still be there if not for the lay-off."
good,"A few benefits could stand tweeking like fully company paid insurance with no deductible. But, overall this is the best company I've ever worked for. Management is very respectful."

good,"CMC was a company that was very laid back.  I enjoyed that I was able to wear casual attire everyday.  "

good,"CMC has helped me advance in my sales career. Overall a great place to work. However, local managers are being forced to implement new corporate policies and regulations that are making it harder for the sales team to build long lasting relationship with current and future customers.

good,"I have two primary jobs."
good,"Exposure to summer heat, in a warehouse, surrounded by molten steel is not an ideal work environment, but accepted under the circumstances.  Anyone who applies to a steel mill should know what they're getting themselves in to.  In a two month period, I attained certifications in First Aid, as well as Crane and Forklift Operations.  Management was very helpful, patient, and willing to teach."

I learned how to safely operate a 4' long gas cutting torch and to withstand extreme heat. The management at CMC Steel are the best you could expect to work for. They worked with me so much in getting me the prescription safety glasses I needed and the metatarsal boots that were required on site. They would always work around my schedule and allow me to work 40 hours per week. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the summer heat; however the management was well aware of the dangers of the heat and was happy to let us take a break and cool off. Occasionally they would provide watermelon and other fruits for the whole plant. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like management and employees were on the same team."
