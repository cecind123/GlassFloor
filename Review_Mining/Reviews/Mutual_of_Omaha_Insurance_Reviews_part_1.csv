rating,review
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,In my 5 years working with Mutual I never felt valued or respected as an employee. I was constantly hounded about doing more production regardless of meeting the goals. Career advancement didn't exist and received no assistance from any manager I had to help me develop that goal. The are I was in only cared about one thing and that was pushing the call volume through regardless if it assisted the customer or not. I would highly not recommend working in the contact center for this company.
bad,"I don’t have anything to say about Mutual of Omaha...good or bad. Mutual Omaha was neither a bad nor good experience."
bad,"Not worth mentioning.  There is favoritism paid to people that don't want to work, and not enough to those for work every day and get their projects done on time.  They have always been a recommended good place to work, but that has changed to accommodate work from home when people are not working from home and not taking vacation time."
bad,"Inconsistent, terrible communication and transperancy from management, unclear goals,management had no problem require members if the team to take on multiple roles due to the lacking of staffing and internal departments. Retaliation was a common complaint from other coworkers, where they felt if they mentioned an issue they would receive backlash. Absolutely my worst job experience."
bad,"This job is great if you are on a temporary assignment. That is how I ended up here. I left after 10 months of looking into why customer's payments bounced. (My main job). Management is terrible, and training is not much better. I was trying to figure out their lingo clear up to the day I left. I only miss my co-workers. Other than that, it's all about the number of business events you close out per hour. Very stressful working environment."
bad,"I was dupes into working here under the impression that I would be enrolled into a financial advisor program....I wasn't, only trained on how to sell life insurance as they have no financial advisor program."
bad,not looking to bad mouth a company just looking for my next career path to be successful at.  you can decide for yourself to work here or not.  do not use my opinion
bad,I was highly misled when interviewing for this job and was basically left on my own to find any business with little to no support from the company at all.
bad,Only do the job if you’re a good salesman who knows a lot of people. Free food. Your own hours and tax write offs. Friendly coworkers. I wouldn’t do it again
bad,This was the worst working experience of my life. On the surface great company to work for. They were a very unfair employer they encouraged their agents to lie to retain business. If you have very low to no morals then please work for this company.
bad,"At the beginning of the year, we were all told my upper management that the starting salary for competing companies was about 8 thousand more than ours, and that they were fighting to get our salaries to where they needed to be.  After several months, they announce that they have had our jobs reviewed and would only be increasing the salary cap, and not our actual salaries.  In addition, they provided a raise to a different department stating that they have the same responsibilities that we do, although they do not.  As a result, a lot of talent was lost and work load increased to an unacceptable amount.   Management still expected us to maintain the same time frame and quality of work even though we were processing double what we were supposed to."
bad,This is a bank that does not know what it wants to be when it grows up.  Focus on CRE transactions does not create a banking relationship and ability to cross sell other services and products.  Deposits are not sought after by the RM's either.
bad,I worked here for awhile and I hated it. Im a honest person and the culture there was to lie to policy holders so that we never had to pay out on anything with a huge cost.
bad,worst company I have ever worked for. Terrible management. People stabbing you in the back on a daily basis. Do not work for this company. I haven't heard one good story coming from Mutual.
bad,This was by far the worst employer I have ever worked for I will never have anything positive to say about mutual ever bad worst company ever
bad,"I worked at this organization very briefly. I was brought in for a role that drastically changed from what was advertised and what I interviewed for. It was total bait & switch, which I discovered later,  the company is well known for. "
bad,"Unless you are extremly good at rejection, want to work very long hours, beg for appointments, and hope to god that your prospect will buy and either be approved or not cancel the policy so that you must return ALL of your commission, then avoid ANY insurance job at all costs. They all make the great pitch (notice I do not say promise) of how much you might possibly make. A very few agents are stars; and the competition is fierce - not only in your own office, but also from overlapping areas within the same company and other companies. Sell a Medicare plan and another agent from another company comes along with a better rate? Bye, bye commission! This is a job that offers zero benefits - no paid vacation, no health insurance, no sick time. Since you are not employed by the company per se, you are responsible for all your own 1099 book keeping - but, don't make the grade and they will cancel your contract and/or not give you your renewal money, and it's commission only!"
bad,Positives: fun place to work.
bad,"I live alone and without personal transportation, so anything further would not be of any use..."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,"Typical non-caring institution. I was terminated because I did not disclose a possible illness that I had at the time of being hired. The illness is one that there are no official tests for therefore I said that I did not have it on the original survey. When I did call the nurse in Omaha to explain that I in fact did have a real diagnosis, I explained that maybe I had both --she asked why I did not say yes to the previous illness, I said that I wasn't sure if it was real and that I was afraid maybe I would not be hired. She then said she would have to bring this to HR. I asked if I could speak to someone in HR, she said no and they would get back to me. The next step was I was terminated for not telling the truth about a private health matter. I was never given a chance to explain my situtation. I was a good employee never called in sick. No job since Nov 2011, we will probably lose our home now. Mutual of Omaha Bank is a prime example of another non-caring institution, they say they are but my experience proves to be different. This could all have been avoided if someone would have cared enough about a good employee and discussed the issue. The day I called the nurse I was very emotional and not thinking clearly -- I tell everyone without going into detail that this is not a good institution. Shame on Mutual of Omaha especially with the workforce being so tight for terminating someone over a private health matter -- who do they think they are? What ever happened to second chances? I didn't steal, did my job, never called in sick. Living in AZ/Nevada employees have very little"
bad,Poor Management and structure within the organization. Sales structure and lead generation are horrible.
bad,horrible
bad,"Management wants to control your every minute as a 1099 relationship with no benefit package. Realized that there is great value in the industry to serve people, however not at Mutual of Omaha. Found little opportunity to succeed in a repressive environment."
bad,They promise the world and give about 1% of what they promise.  Never allowed to express an opinion or suggest improvements. Corporate environment that says you can be an independent non-captive agent but don't allow you to sell products you are legally able to sell.
bad,Poor management with no investment in employees.  They are firing employees with Defined Benefit plan benefits.  Took away defined benefits for all employees effectively reducing pay by 18% and only offering 3% on 401k replacement plan.  Treat employees with no respect.
bad,Worst management ever.  The average work staff is 50 years old.  Most workers have only worked here and have no clue about what a work environment should be.  They feel entitled and new workers are treated likenobodys.  No one listens to you or your ideas.  Not a friendly work staff.  Stay away from this company!!!!!
bad,"Management did not care about the individual.  It appeared to me that their goal was to hire as many new employees as possible, utilize their list of recourses and then tell them a few months later that they did not seem fit for the job.  This was extremely disappointing because it was a career that I was initially excited to do.  Promises were made that were not kept and the assistance on learning how to succeed were not available.  The only nice part of the job was that we could make out own schedules.  We did have weekly meetings as well at specific times but it seemed as though many of the employees were too disrespectful and un caring to wake up early and attend these meetings.  Overall an awful experience that ended up costing way more money than it was worth."
bad,"Beware females.....this is nothing but and old boys club. They lie and they cover up for incompetent field management. Little to no support for field agents, they charge expenses back and put you out of business before you get started. Training leaves much to be desired. Stay away."
bad,I left because I wanted to raise my family and the Company didn't allow a good balance for work and family life. There was new ownership and they initiated too many changes at the same time.
bad,"This place made you buy leads for 25 each, of course 95% or those leads would be where people called in about getting insurance and they were un-insurable or couldn't afford anything. I made 10K in my first yr and spent 7K on leads- the work environment was bad also- very negative place to work"
bad,"Division General Manager is verbally abusive to employees. He is contradictory on goals and requirements. I enjoyed working with the rest of the team. Appropriate training for the job was not provided. It was very difficult to gain information to match my job skills and knowledge to this position. I was very underutilized in this position due to the General Managers style of management. He is not a big believer in training, change management, or modern management styles. In a word, this position was very Draconian. Manager reminded me of many holdovers from the 70's and 80's corporate culture. I realized I made a mistake working here when I saw his personality change after I was hired. He totally denigrated a fellow manager during a staff conference call ... the catch is that I worked with this other manager and he certainly did not deserve the verbal abuse. The General Manager did not have, nor did he WANT to have, all the facts of the subject of conversation. I have to admit that having worked as a trainer and recruiter at Mutual of Omaha, I now feel bad for the people I recruited that will have to endure the abuse from this General Manager. My advice ... steer clear if you have a truly professional character. My job was presented in a terrific and professional light ... then things fell apart after hiring."
bad,Not able to change processes to make more effective. Most employees are data entry. Lack of skill in whole department. The management does not look at bigger picture which is what j was brought in for and any change was highly resisted
bad,"I made the mistake of complaining to Management about not being trained properly and/or being emotionally bullied by co-workers. Shortly thereafter, I made a human error  - lost no money - but was 'let go'. Management were waiting for me to make a mistake in my opinion: wanted to 'push me out'. I would never recommend this company to work for."
bad,"I would not tell anyone to wok here. It is a case by case situation. My Mutual of Omaha branch was unorganized and didn't advance my career. Some other branches are better though. Mine, however, was terrible."
bad,How this company makes millions of dollars is beyond me. They are in a constant state of change with no good feedback on performance. In addition Communication in general is absolutely awful.
bad,"The management in this area was very secretive and shady. They didn't return your emails for days or even respond to you in person. The only time you would ever hear from them was if you messed up on something - not a thank you for working 50+ hours a week to help them stay ahead because of the awful plan that they implemented in that area. I would never suggest working at Mutual of Omaha - a lot of hard, draining, work and no appreciation. "
bad,"Manager was upset with me for not re-writing policy which would put more money in our pockets instead of leaving in the customers pocket, had his favorites and I was not one of them.."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,"I am great in sales and had success at M.O.O but once you start doing too well the fees start increasing until you are getting less than half of your paycheck, then they ""change the commission structure"" whenever you have a big case so they do not have to pay you. I quit over 3 months ago and I am still getting bills from them for phone usage and insurance that protects me if I make a misstatement. Complete rip off 5 out of the 9 salespeople in my office have quite in the last 2 months. Just a horrible company that works unethically."
bad,"Worked there as temp over two years, never made a regular employee. So I got no raise, vacation or bonus etc. Then moved to their customer service area and let go after getting sick and only missing a few days. Poor management, and lied to a lot. Would not recommend if you want a real career."
bad,Leaders are not aligned and treat employees differently. Some departments are great to work in others are not. Depends on the department as to whether or not it is a great place to work.
bad,I was a customer care analyst processing updates to life insurance policies.  I had trouble getting the hang of it fast enough and instead of helping me they let me go after only six weeks in training.  I picked up and moved to Omaha super last minute for this job and this is what I get!  Major BS!  Pay was awesome though
bad,"Nice office. Great products to sell and great method of selling it, however no help to the new employees. Terrible leads as well."
bad,back to back phone calls
bad,"Work as independent contractor."
bad,Management is very poor and has a very high turnover. Mutual of Omaha does everything manually and is slow to upgrade. I won't recommend a friend to this job.
bad,This was a good company to bring in some income as a temp until I was able to obtain full time employment on my own.
bad,"Between the time I got an offer and a contract til the day I started (2 weeks), they override in half. The base is below market. Most of the local managers are gone now. Maybe it will get better, but was incredibly micromanaged."
bad,"Mutual of Omaha WAS a great company in which to work. In the last year (2017) they seemed to change their focus from being well established over 100 year old insurance providers to a Financial Advisory Brokerage. This would be ok if they actually had a plan. They changed their District Sales Manager(DSM) and General Manager's (GM) compensation so drastically, they've lost over 25% of their management force. Most of the DSM's and GM's that left were from top producing agencies in which they ran for many years.There is no job security there anymore, because even if you do perform well, there is no guarantee they won't change the metrics they rate you by on a whim. Also, if you are a woman, forget about it. This company is run by a ""good ol' boys"" network. If you're thinking about working as a GM, DSM, or Insurance Agent for this company, do your self a favor, save some time and either look for another company or just go with an Independent Brokerage. Stay away from this sinking ship."
bad,this job required networking with individual to obtain leads for people needing life insurance and financial products. Interview prospective clients retrieving information for the underwriting department to make a decision on coverage.
bad,"A typical day involves making calls to set appointments, except for  Mondays, which is reserved for training. Besides making calls one can find other ways to meet people. During the week it is good practice to come to the office to check up on the application that are being processed. I enjoy working with my coworkers. We all try to help each other."
bad,The continued to promise me things and never delivered. The managed me is not very good and the compensation is very poor.
bad,"Lots of favoritism. Management is horrible. Company sends out employer surveys a few times a year, but most wonder if management ever reviewed the results."
bad,"Overall Mutual of Omaha is good company which strives for ethics and excellence. The Customer Contact Center however is focused on production only, unrealistic goals, inadequate management with no regard to the hard working person or personal lives of there employees. I would never suggest this specific department to anyone. The over all company on the other hand I would suggest. "
bad,"A typical day was entering data for new insurances who wished to sell Mutual of Omaha's products.  We also alternated answering phone calls for our department.  I learned I did not want to stay in my department and I did not care for now my supervisors treated me.  Granted, it was around the time the company started downsizing as it became more automated, so that created its own sets of issues for employees.  Some of the managers were decent; I was not too impressed with most of them.  The hardest part of the job was the favoritism.  The most enjoyable part of the job was developing friendships with people in the department."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,"They had corrupt and antiquated corporate management. The Division & District Manager left Mutual of Omaha, and they didn’t hire new managers to run the Division or District. This produced an inefficient and disconcerting work environment, which gave rise to stagnant business growth & corrupt business practices by upper management."
bad,"Cold call prospective insurance clients. Follow leads to interview clients."
bad,sold life insurance policies for this company.  straight commision.  comany held weekly meetings. called out those that made great numbers and called out in public when you did not. company did not give support and they promised
bad,"Where do I begain? This is a terrible place to work! Employees are not welcoming to newcomers, company technology is old and not integrated, the turnover rate is some departments is upwards of 40-50%, and this company could careless about employees. Just like any other insurance company, Mutual is concerned with numbers and profits. If you can't reach production or too slowly to catch on, they will get rid of you. Management is very unprofessional, they have ""favorites"", and often gossip about the quality and performance of individuals to other employees. It's very hard to get a position with this company. The HR department is none existent as they do most of their hiring through staffing agencies. This allows Mutual to keep their staffing costs low and a roundabout way not to provide benefits. If you want a job during the next recession Mutual or Insurance for that matter is not the way to go! They do shady things and are only concerned with profits and pushing out work as fast as you can!"
bad,"Financial senior management won't keep their nose out of the details. The best part about the job was the people you work with on a daily basis. Although they have not kept up with technology, they are good, hardworking individuals."
bad,"Seems to be eliminating mid-level (associate and management), self thinkers. Either an employee falls into the lower paid widget maker, or highly paid sales or high-level management."
bad,"the jobs pay well at Mutual of Omaha, training is extensive. Some managers have their favorite employees and bend over backwards to help them while others get left behind. HR always sided with managers."
bad,"I worked in the Call Center of Mutual of Omaha. They have horrible turnover in their call center. To be able to advance in the company, you are required to be perfect in every aspect. So, if you have a sick child, plan on being terminated not long after."
bad,"Review, I believe, is specific to one department, not the entire organization. Hope I'm right. between long queues and wait times, it is very difficult to meet performance measures."
bad,it was ok and nothing really stood out that would make me stay.  The pay  was strange with the employer paying me along with other agents.  It was ok to work there
bad,Agents were treated unfairly and the policy's were not competitive with other policies with other companies. If the company were under different management  my review would have been better
bad,"There is no communication between management and the employees. When a question is asked, it is hardly ever answered. Management does not listen to the employees. Stats and sales are all they care about in this company. They do not treat their employees very well. It is a ""revolving door"" company."
bad,"No special benefit to working here as opposed to another Insurance Company.   Good products but,  not well supported."
bad,"If there is any enjoyable part of the job or excitement, it would be whenever I issue an application. Because this gives me commissions and the guarantee that I will stay in this position. A lot of things to learn with almost no training except the orientation for few hours."
bad,"I was a sales rep on 100% commission.  My greatest competition was Mutual of Omaha.  I focused on the senior market and was doing well and worked hard to build trust with my clients.  This was hard to do because when I would write a guarantee issue policy,MOO would start marketing them to buy direct at a 20% discount which I could not do.  Clients would call and ask why I was charging so much for their insurance. Mngmt told me to tell them that the extra provided them an agent.  YEA RIGHT!"
bad,The pay and benefits are good but the management leaves something to be desired.  Career advancement opportunities are few and far between.  I guess it would be a good place to work if you're not looking for career advancement.
bad,"I would never refer anyone to work for this organization.  Upper management treat their employee's like they are beneath them.  They don't care about your feedback, or your career path goals."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,"Management was fine when I was there. Products are geared more toward young, healthy clients instead of retirement age folks. Compensation is above average."
bad,"majority to job is cold calling perspective clients to build your business.  You will be asked to solicit  everyone you know, and will eventually because you are desperate for clients."
bad,"Mutual of Omaha is a good company to work for if you live in Omaha, NE.  They do a good job with work/life balance.  Benefits are not the best and Job Security has totally changed.  Management is very conservative and the overall work force is not diversified."
bad,"Old Technology and Old Culture. If you have not been their 20, 30, or 40 years you do not matter. The Culture holds everything back. The individuals that have worked here so long are blind to whether or not what they are doing in technology is good or makes any sense. Systems have grown over time and are complex, old, and over customized. Downtime is acceptable and expected. There are pockets and emerging tech, however it is mostly show and no go. In general there is not a great motivator to change anything, the company is very profitable as is."
bad,"Benefits are a joke, no benefits. Management is not good. You may get paid and you may not.  If you leave make sure you are not charged for rent, utilities, etc. This is not a good company to work for if you are supporting a family. The insurance products are excellent but management at this location is so bad. It is not worth the headache."
bad,We first started the day with a morning orientation basically giving us a brief walk through of the building. Then after that they took us straight into training from then on. The trainer handed us a binder filled with spotty information that skipped procedural steps. We went through 6 test cases before doing actual production contracts by our THIRD DAY there. By the second week of training they were already giving us production and quality goals that we had to meet. By the third week they were letting people go who they didn't think we're catching up. The lack of communication the management displayed made you feel like you were on your own and it seemed like your best interests wasn't a priority to them.
bad,"The job itself was good and one that I did well at.  However the atmosphere was the worst that I have encountered.  Infighting and office politics control who was recognized and advanced.  People working there getting advancement based on information they lied about on their application, such as their education.  People being passed over for promotion simply because they work too hard at the job they are currently doing while those that slack off and create problems for the rest of their team are advanced because they appear to be on top of things, basically because they aren't doing their work.  If you just want a job to come to, keep your head down, and punch the clock in and out this company might work for you.  If you want to make something of yourself or advance you better know the right people and learn how to look good, that is what matters."
bad,"Had poor management, then had no management, not sure which was worse. Good flexibility, but low income stability. You're responsible for all your business, but you DO NOT own your book. 100% commission"
bad,"There were multiple rumors spread about a fictitious relationship I had with a trainer/supervisor who is 20 years my senior. When these rumors were brought to my attention I was told that the relationship needed to end by a senior member of leadership. I reiterated to the various HR employees that the relationship in question did not exist and that I was only vaguely familiar with the other party. I was told that I was lying and was given a final written warning for my lack of professionalism. This company has cultivated a respectable image for itself over more than 108 years, but under the current leadership, the customer service department are surely going to be the Achilles heel of the company. I cant recommend anyone work for this company, at least not in any customer facing role. This is why I left the company."
bad,"This place will make you stressed to the max, They have metrics you have to meet that aren't achievable some of the times. Attendance policy is not the best either. If you are a single parent with no help I do NOT recommend applying here. If you miss 6 days in 6 months you are fired. the Hardest part of the job was that you are on the Phones 7 days a week being yelled at for things you cannot control."
bad,Full commission. If you can find leads you can make alot of money if you can't then you'll wash out very quick. Insurance is a harder sell in a low interest rate environment.
bad,They don't respect their employees. They are overworked and given way too many tasks to handle at once. People were dropping like flies. There is virtually no job security here whatsoever. At least not for anyone hired within the last 2 years. I'm not sure if this is due to management changes or the new CEO but it was awful.
bad,"Mutual of Omaha has tried to create a friendly work place.  Depending on your role the expectations are unreachable and rarely unrewarded."
bad,This employer would have been a wonderful company to work for if my employer had been honest with me in the beginning. As I was working he was in his office sitting around with his feet on his desk. Come to find out later on he was released because of illegal activities-no big surprise there.
bad,"provided sales and marketing of insurance and investment products and service, consulted with clients from a needs base concept, giving presentations to individuals, small business and the local church market."
bad,"Mutual of Omaha is commission based opportunity for someone who does not have a family and is willing to work very long, tedious hours to make a living."
bad,"I might not be good at conversing with people, but I like to think people do not hate me immediately.  Mutual requires both the ability to be likable to strangers and the ability to convince them to fear the worst case scenario."
bad,"Poor training programs, but decent people to work with. Management needs to spend more time mentoring lower employees."
bad,Its a good place to work but you must first sell 5 life apps and make 3000$ before you can even sign the contract.  Managers will help you out when they can but your pretty much on your own.
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
bad,"●	Answer incoming calls for policy owners, agents and brokers. Analyze policies for customers to explain all aspects of policies, including premium schedules, death benefits, numerous types of riders, and various other types of policies. Assist customers with needed documentation in addition to filling out forms as well respond via email and fax. Delegate customer requests to the proper department, as well as escalate as needed. Work well in a team environment and independently with little supervision"
bad,Excellent product training.  Substandard sales management.   Unfair sales leads distribution.  Leads given to preferred agents.  Excellent general manager.
bad,Mutual bank was not so good.  I enjoyed my duties but not upper management.  Working to develop a contract and vendor management system was very fulfilling.
bad,Poor management and human resources.
bad,"Call customers, send emails to customers and back office, take transactions, open accounts, do quality assurance on new accounts, kept updated on bank procedure and policy changes, safeguard customers information."
good,"Each office had team autonomy which decreased the level of emotional exhaustion felt by individual team members. Teams worked as a cohesive unit. Everyone was on the same page about what to do with their independence, and it worked very well. The managers made sure there was enough structure and leadership in place to keep everyone supportive of the team’s goals.As the primary cheerleader managers could definitely make or break the foundation of the teams.  The message from senior management was very supportive and until new management arrived it worked very well."
good,"Company is ok, not great. New CEO, I have hope for the company. MOO needs to get up to speed with this century, they hold many older generation managers that call themselves leaders, however, they drive people out. Upper management does not embrace new ideas or thoughts, my way or the highway mentality. Culture is terrible, no room for opinions or suggestions."
good,"A mixed bag.  Nepotism runs deep.  Working in an environment that is mainly female.  If you're in, you're in, if you're not, you're not and won't last long.  Lip service to a better working environment and home/work balance but all the while making horrid working condition changes.  I loved working there most of the time, despite all of the changes and politics."
good,Cold-calling is unpleasant and you will not make much money until you have been doing this for at least a year and have built up lots of clients.
good,Best thing was that you had your own cubicle area that you could decorate
good,"Lots of changes and uncertainty in the organization overall, but particularly the IT Department. The company motto has been do more with less, or “high performance”, which is code for one person doing 4 full time jobs."
good,"The company and products offered at Mutual of Omaha, are some of the best, and the compensation schedule is very competitive.  The trouble is the management.  Some of the upper staff have never been in the field, and it shows.  The manager that I worked under I would consider to be rude, insulting, and incompetent."
good,"I liked repetitive work, learning SQL, the different RDBMS, working with the project managers, culture was stressful. The hardest part of the job was the feeling of non-acceptance. The most enjoyable part of the job was when people took the initiative to explain new concepts to me."
good,"Casual work environment, great cafeteria. Company has excellent benefits, flexible work hours. I learned organization, detail and professionalism and what having great character means."
good,"When I was recruited to come to Mutual of Omaha there was a Recruiter, General Manager and one field trainer. After 2 weeks of coming over to Mutual of Omaha the recruiter was let go and after 2 months of being at Mutual of Omaha the General Manager quit.  Mutual of Omaha sells several products (Disability, and Whole Life Insurance and Guaranteed Life) that I have not sold in the past. There is nobody in the office that can answer any questions I have about these products. I have to call the Mutual of Omaha's main office in Nebraska in order to get my questions answered."
good,Be prepared for a very inconsistent job.  Favortisim and deceit is the motto in the office.  Stay away if possible.  Company is decent but management is a different story.
good,"Company has great people working there. However, job security or having a concrete income changes from month to month. Their underwriting is terrible and delays pay. Turnaround time for process time to get things approved for applications is terrible."
good,"I enjoyed the flexibility and earning potential that this job provided. However, being a 1099 contractor, selling insurance products right out of college was extremely challenging to support myself."
good,"Mutual of Omaha is a old fashioned company.  As a Mutual association there are no stockholders to answer to so the business moves at the slowest possible pace to stay in business.  The people who work here will proudly tell you they are ""Lifers"" and never intend to leave.  Anyone who works there stays long enough to figure out they don't want to be a ""Lifer"" or they stay on until retirement."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,"A Typical day at work including reviewing new policies, checking status on applications previously received and answering phone calls.  There was a lot all the time, you'll never run out."
good,"Mutual of Omaha is a leading provider of life insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, disability insurance products and annuities.  Mutual of Omaha is a privately held Fortune 500 mutual insurance and financial services company based in Omaha, Nebraska."
good,"There isn't a typical day in this position. Customer Service dictates my day. I deal with elevated issues, and support a team of 18 associates, with four different job grades.I manage relationships in the eastern region, about 11 offices combined, assist with educating new sales reps and work directly with regional managers."
good,"I was to upsell and get new customers insurance. it was phones all day, talking to people about real life situatiuons"
good,"If it wasn't for my regional manager I would hate this job. Typical day is 630-630. Co workers are all very cool but because of the stress and strain of the job there is no time to build lasting relationships. The job does include lots of ""forced fun"" and provides a fantastic training program."
good,"Very friendly staff"
good,"Take calls from insureds as well as providers and ensure that patient issues are resolved in a timely manner, and that medical operations run as smoothly manner."
good,Temp job. Long time temp job low chance to get hired full time. Lack of sick leave or chance to earn  vacation hours . Lack of respect or chance of advancement.
good,Always had tasks to complete. Bank holidays off. Lacking support to use advanced technologies. Repremanded for voicing my opinions. Lacks workplace equality.
good,"My experience at Mutual of Omaha left a very bad taste in my mouth. When I started at Mutual of Omaha I was very excited and I felt privileged to work at such a prestigious company. I went to college to obtain a specific diploma so that I had something additional over other candidates that were applying . My experience there was good. I loved the incentives , discounts, parties and restaurant options that were available only to employees.  The workplace environment could have been better but my plan was to advance to a specific department so I was accepting of the fact that I had to start at the bottom. During my stay I became ill and had to undergo treatment for my illness I ran out of FMLA the first year and at the beginning of the second year I ran out of my FMLA as well. Because of this I was terminated from my employment with Mutual of Omaha. I was told when I was finished with treatment that I would be eligible to come back and work for Mutual of Omaha but I would have to go through training because things had changed. Although I was disappointed I understood because I could come back. Once I was told by my doctor I was in the clear, which was shortly after I completed my treatment, I went back and was told to refill out the application excetera. I did these things but I never got my job back. I was aware I had to start at the bottom again and work my way up again and I was fine with that. Unfortunately I tried for the next two and a half years to get my job back and was very unsuccessful.  I spoke with several people in Human Resources as well as management who were rude"
good,"due to the company falling under the federal requirement. all NY offices were closed and the company discontinued their Life products in NY.. Agents were welcomed to stay on board, but were no longer able to continue selling insurance."
good,"Responsible for creating, writing, developing and designing creative materials and programs for clients throughout the Companies. Primarily responsible for writing and on-camera reporting for news-oriented programs serving educational, informational and motivational needs for Companies’ field representatives nationwide."
good,"Strict standards"
good,"Manager was very good sales person but no clue how to manage.  It was May before we got our goals and they were very different than what we were being told."
good,"Overall Company culture is pleasant, with training and management support. Great job for someone that can put in 40+ hours per week and is self-motivated."
good,The key word here is old.  Very old fashioned and not really a place to be treated well.  The payment of commissions was very slow.
good,The company is all the about numbers.  They are more concerned about statistics then the employee.  There is a limited amount of advancement opportunities.  The management was supportive.  My co-workers are great to work with.  I have learned a lot about health care for medicare supplements and life insurance.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer and answer all of there questions.
good,Have to make your own way. This is not for those starting out. Seems to be difficult unless you're ready to be a bottom feeder for a while.
good,Handled inbound calls for life insurance claims as well as service calls for medicare supplement plans and life insurance policies.  Since working at Mutual I have learned a lot more about the insurance industry.  Management never really recognized my true capabilites in order to advance.  Based on my skills and previous experience I was capable of handling much more responsibility. After several attempts in meeting with my supervisor nothing ever materialized.  I always met my monthly goals. The most enjoyable part of my job were the employees that worked around me and for me there wasn't anything difficult about my job.
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,Not much room for advancement & Job Security is questionable...
good,"calling, contacting clients and sales."
good,This is a commission job . I came in excited to to meet my goals and I did . But I had unforeseen changes that took me off my  course to success. The products that this company has the best in the industry . I know I'm helping my clients with the best .
good,"A typically workday involves meeting with customer accounts, promoting products to those companies and ensuring that the operation of business runs smoothly.  "
good,"Great Life products, internal support and commission structure. As an independent agent you are operating your own agency, responsible for office space, purchasing of leads, sales & marketing."
good,"My jobs were customer service related."
good,"Trained and passed state exam for Texas Insurance License. Learned the needs of individuals for health, life and disability. Helping others with medicare supplements"
good,"Overall, "
good,"A typical day involved almost no interaction with co workers or management, almost no feed back, and very monotonous work. There was no push to advance the employee, or for the employee to take advantage of opportunities for education, it was almost discouraged as this would take away from pushing out as many application reviews as possible. The job was not hard, but the training was inadequate. They have a very high turn over and say they are open to criticism of their system, but when faced with it are obstinate about the way things are done and inflexible. While I was employed they had 8 employees quit in our 23 person department and continually had to retrain new people. They often only hired through temp agencies because of this."
good,I was a licensed Life agent in 50 states servicing new and existing clients with any and all insurance needs.  Started to feel too much like a telemarketer. Became too difficult dealing with complaint calls all day long.
good,This job was very demanding and not very family friendly. The branch office I worked in is no longer there. If you like working very quietly and with not much interaction with others this job might be for you.
good,"Mutual of Omaha is a great company to work for. You have to be self motivated. You get to make your own hours, it is a great job if you have little ones. You get great bonuses based off the commission you made from the prior month. Downside: If you don't sell, you don't make money and it can make it challenging at times if it is your only source of income."
good,"Work-life balance nearly impossible to maintain.  Culture was disjointed, too many people from too many cultures, and no defined bank culture."
good,"Mutual of Omaha had fun initiatives and offered many benefits, however the stress of dealing with forever upset customers and having lack of organization or support from management made it extremely difficult and taxing."
good,The product they sell is a good one for the customers.  They should compensate their employees better.  They are the ones making all of the money for the departments and really do not see enough money for their efforts.
good,"I would have daily contact with clients and broker regarding the implementation status of their benefits admin website.  "
good,"My job as an insurance broker was very challenging. My job consisted of calling leads to set up appointments to sell them mortgage protection through life insurance. The leads cost money, so I had to invest in them. I was in charge of three counties and had to effectively manage them in order to be efficient with my time. The hardest part of my job was going from one appointment to the next just to find people who either had a major health situation recently or who just couldn't afford the coverage. If they got past those two hurdles, they needed to get approved. If they followed through with a possible phone interview and past it and got approved, some of them still decided they wanted to cancel it shortly after. This is not good when you are on 100% commission. The management was very talented and was very willing to help when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was the freedom and flexibility if offered to my schedule. My co worker were great, but a good relationship with a co worker wasn't going to get a policy approved."
good,Foodservice is a very busy department. Being able to provider that excellent service was a daily goal. The team was very supportive when needed to jump in and help.
good,"As a business manager I had all the duties required in a daily routine."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,"It was a good place to work, there managers are great people to work with as long as you communicate they will work with you. Monday through Friday set schedule."
good,Long hours and high requisition loads. Too much administrative work. Good people working there though. Benefits are OK and the 401K is a really strong benefit.
good,Mutual of Omaha is an ok place to work.  However they have a long way to go with promoting minorities into leadership & upper management roles.  Upper mangement needs to get onboad.
good,"The work is fast paced, fun, and rewarding. I met a lot of wonderful people whom I still keep in touch with. But unfortunately, direct management cares more about pleasing upper management then their employees. This is why I decided to leave. If management changes, I'd go back in a heart beat!"
good,"It is a pretty typical call center experience, you are chained to a desk 95% of your day with strict adherence taking back to back phone calls. My direct supervisor was an off the street hire new to call center culture and appeared lost the majority of the time. This was my first experience with the healthcare side of call centers which i found very depressing. Your job was taking 40-60 calls a day just word vomiting policy information, hearing policy holder's medical issues with no way to help or resolve issues."
good,"Was young when i had this jib, was a tough job to get started in had to pass state test to be licensed to sell life and health insurance in ny state, had to pay for your leads so money came out of your pocket weeks before u got paid."
good,"I would make sales presentations to potential clients, make cold calls, work leads, and phone calls.  I was just out of college so the hardest part was developing leads and making cold calls."
good,"The people there are good to work with. However, I don't know if they know what to do when I come to IT and product development. The environment was good."
good,Learning claims review was easily performed because of the great training programs offered to employees by the company.  Success was easily obtained within the company.  Enjoyable company to work for.
good,"Make phone calls, customer service, learned banking systems and regulations. Hardest part is traveling an hour to work each way. Most enjoyable is helping customers with problems they have."
good,The main office is very big. Thousands of employees. You do a lot of walking. The elevators are slow and go one at a time so you can be late for work a lot and returning from your breaks or lunches. You meet a lot of people. They have a great career counselor on staff that can assist you with building yourself and resume to make yourself more marketable.
good,Mutual of Omaha is a big company with strong ethics. Loose trigger HR and cult like mentality with many unwritten rules. Supervisors are survivors with clear thirst for making you suffer as they did.
good,"This job was close to home, but however they do not provide medical insurance any longer, just life insurance, short term and long term disability and life insurance"
good,"The area I worked, at Mutual of Omaha, was extremely stressful and micro managed. Not all areas of the company are this way. I believe it all depends on the director and managers of the areas. "
good,"regular routine processing claims. "
good,"I enjoyed this job and staying busy, My supervisor was very helpful and a joy to be around. She would explain things you didn't understand until you got it."
good,"made lots of cold calls and spent a lot of time marketing and  maintaining relationships with clients. Work place culture was good and fast paced.  Management helped a lot also lots of out side the office team building. More seasoned employees did help out with conducting classes, and ride along etc..."
good,"This is a work hard play hard environment. You are expected to perform at 110% and advancement opportunities are cutthroat. They do offer a generous pay and benefits package, though."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,Engaged management encourages innovations and changes. Never a dull moment. They strive for a great workplace culture and actively listen to their customers.
good,Just make sure you get adequate and sufficient training for the role you are accepted for. I have nothing else to say.  It started out as an amazing experience.
good,A nice place to work. Slower paced company without the full range of products necessary to compete in the white collar executive and business owner marketplace.
good,"When I was employed there, it was a great place to work.  My manager was a joy to work for and it was never overwhelming to tackle even the most challenging tasks."
good,"My time there was quite some time ago. I am not in a position to speak to the current environment. My time was fair one, and would recommend the company to someone, if they had the right background"
good,"I worked in multiple fields as a Support Clerk. This means I was not regulated to working in a cubical all day. I did filing, mail delivery, envelop stuffing, handling incoming mail and special projects."
good,"I think that it is an older company, and there are a lot of older generations that still have a pension that do not want to change their ways or train the younger generations. Management doesn't talk to the employees as much as they should to get valuable feedback. Example: making it an open environment."
good,"Friendly cooperative team work place. "
good,Management lived there mission statement day in and day out. They believed in taking care of each employee so they could focus their full attention on taking care of members.The members are hands down the best part of the job... The benefits rock... FREE Gym... Education Assistance... Onsite summer childcare sponsored by the YMCA...
good,The only problem is that there was a lack of direction of who was in charge of completing projects. There was no designated system or hierarchy to refer to.
good,A typical day at work consist of assigned work tasks with office administrative duties. I've learned about insurance indemnity products and have been managed under many managers within different departments. The work place in a casual dress environment with open cubicles as the workstation.  The hardest part of the job is not seeing my position become a permanent job within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the workload does make the day move forward with no take home work
good,People work hard and most are great no advancement opportunities at Mutual and they seem fast to fire people. I like working hard and have fun doing it.
good,Job flexibility is great. Work hard and get paid great. if you want to know if you have what it takes to be a sales person this is a great place to test your skills out.
good,good transitional place to work when deciding what direction to go in. ability to gain knowledge and experience in high paced environment.
good,I was unable to continue because I needed a more steady stream of income. I did enjoy the time I spent with Mutual of Omaha.
good,Nothing special about the company.  They will let people work their way up the ladder.  They wasted a lot of money hiring outside consulting firms to come in telling them each time they had too much middle management.  Glad I left when I did as they shut down the division that I worked in.
good,"In this position I recruited, trained, mentored and coached independent contract agents to sell the full product line.  I would set goals and hold them accountable so as to meet their needs, the needs of their clients and to align with corporate goals."
good,Mutual has provided me with a lot of good opportunities to learn and grow but I'm looking for a potential change
good,Handled all correspondence from vendors and through interoffice ensuring consistent workflow.  Typed all outgoing and interoffice correspondence from five different officers.  Maintained five different officer calendars as well as scheduling meetings for all the department.  Handled all phone calls within the Department.
good,"Cold-calling from a list of leads is indeed a great challenge, particularly in a world where few people pick up the phone from a number they don't recognize.  "
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,Processing contracting paperwork and running background checks for incoming licensed insurance agents.
good,"Management deflects all questions you have, tells you the wrong things, then dodges critical questions. Its no wonder they aren't up there with the NWMs or NYLifes."
good,Great place for a first job. It's company is very competitive in the pay.
good,"The call center environment is high expectations with a pay that does not match. You do not get to choose what area you are in. There is zero incentive to do extra projects, take on additional responsibilities and you are put where they want you.....even if you excel in your current position. "
good,"I unfairly got stuck in this training position. I am the only train for the department and am often times tired, stressed due to lack of planning and communication."
good,A typical day consisted of working 4 new disability claims most days while also managing the caseload of clients you had before. I learned that I was very good managing myself. The workplace culture was good before this February when a lot of insurance people were brought in from another company. The hardest part of job was the workload. The most enjoyable was that I was independent in making decisions
good,"I did like it here, the star is nice along with friendly clients. Although, it was a short amount of time I did learn a lot that prepared me for my job that came later."
good,"Overall this was a pretty good place to work.  My manager was great.  Processing, closing and underwriting were terrific too.  The problem was the guys at the top.  They didn't know what they were doing.  That's why it imploded."
good,"Good place to work but there are no upward mobility opportunities."
good,"Strong company with a good brand among the public.  Through my work, I am trying to strengthen the brand among financial advisors."
good,"Good place to work over all. They are in need of good, hard workers that don't cut corners (That was a problem in the past)."
good,I need more consistency in cash flow.It is only a commission job which bring me back to my point of consistency.
good,"Company with a great family culture. However, it is a very intensive culture and based primarily around the results you put up in regards to your sales goal."
good,"While I still believe that Mutual is a great company to work for, there is a lot of nepotism and politics behind the scene and in individual departments. They advertise they are a customer focused company but they aren’t. It’s all about the numbers. But even then, your performance could be perfect but if you don’t dance for the puppeteer your job is always at risk."
good,"What the summary says.  As a financial advisor my job is all about client building.  If one can get people in the door, they will succeed, if they can't they won't.  Direction on how to do it is a moderate amount, but it's up to each person to make it work."
good,"It's on OK place to work. Not Great. Not Bad. I guess it really depends on your department and manager. Beings Mutual is so big, you can have a completely different experience in one department than in another."
good,Compensation structure makes it difficult to get off the ground.  It's not impossible but it's definitely a slow build. Office environment was great and people were great.  Management was also very good.
good,"I learned that those who put forth extra effort will be given more work to do, while those who slack off just continue to slack off. Extra work and effort are not necessarily rewarded beyond feeling good about yourself for doing a good job. Company doesn't necessarily recognize special effort on your part. Best part of the job is getting to create and produce something, using modern equipment, and the company making it possible to stay current with programs and applications for doing the job."
good,comparable to other companies in the industry. Nice company and they will help you grow. comparable to other companies in the industry. this business can change your life

good,"Analyzed and completed initial imaging data entry function on incoming correspondence and applications, entered into computer system information from life insurance applications. Occasionally provided customer service to field agents and other customers as needed."
good,It is a very good company to work for. They tend to be very flexible in allowing a work/life balance. It all depends on the direct management you are working for.
good,"Was able to learn about micro management and fast paced sales. Pay was great commission only but with no cap on overall earning, Was able to build own client database."
good,"Mutual of Omaha Bank is a customary, regional commercial bank environment.  It is a stable, garden-variety, top-down management culture.  It wasn't necessarily cutting-edge, but neither was it a harsh or unreasonable work culture.  it is Midwestern, old-school, corporate banking.."
good,"Mutual of Omaha is in need of a major technological makeover.  Their field offices have outdated phone systems.  They are just adopting a relevant CRM and they don't seem to understand that field managers should have corporate phones and credit cards so our personal lives don't become interwoven with our business lives.  "
good,Everything was on commission bases.  You had to sales insurance and gain a customer base business.  You had an area that you had to basically work and get leads and sale your products to them to get your commissions.
good,"A typical day is calling small business clients on the phone to get"
good,"this is a great job if you like people. I love people so it worked for me, there is travel, and relationship building. it was fun, and a great experience."
good,"Providing customer service to current and future policyholders to implement and manage their life insurance policies, Learned a lot about how insurance works and how the elderly have to deal with a lot that can cost them their insurance. The hardest is meeting the stats every month."
good,I loved the people I worked with.  I did not have a lot of guidance as far as what was expected of me at the office.  No benefits was a downfall.
good,"Cold Calling is a must, you have to be open to learning, and growing, you have to have tough skin to handle NO, a lot. Very flexible hours, cool co-workers, hardest part is getting the sales, best part is the perks."
good,There is a lot to learn from various departments across the company. Employees are good at communicating with each other and providing positive teamwork. The management from my experience and unwilling/difficult to work with those with disabilities and employees on their team. There was little room for advancement unless you move to another department.
good,"Good Company with great products ,productivity and recruitment is more important to staff."
good,"This position started with payment of group health claims then involved into a computerized claim payment system.  Payment of claims, answering phones, filing of claims, supervising staff, working with Mutual of Omaha staff in Omaha, NE, and auditing claims for errors and/or fraud.  I learned to pay claims in a computerized claims payment environment.  Co-workers were good and the hardest part of this job was supervising staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Clients."
good,"Its ok. As long as you expect to not have an opinion or be recongnized for any contributions you make, you'll be fine. Typical case of too many cooks in the kitchen,  management argues amongst themselves (in an open environment seating plan) constantly. General Manager of our division would come out and yell at everyone for things we had no control over. Money and benefits were very good, but everyone is definitely happy when the workday is over."
good,I have gained a tremendous amount of experience and networking opportunities.
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,I would rather not say anymore about the work environment at this job.
good,"Mutual of Omaha had just opened a new claims center in Woodward, Oklahoma.  Jobs there are scarce and so there was a massive number of people applying for all job types offered.  It felt very dog-eat-dog and the amount of competition for those jobs, though not the fault of MOO, were very present.  Once hired, the competitiveness based on quotas, was intense.  I started in Dental Claims Processing, which was a smaller department than Medical, but it was still hard to continue such a fast paced environment while attending to my young family.  I eventually moved to Medical Claims, and then Customer Service, then back to Medical Claims.  I eventually left MOO because of the over-the-top competitiveness between employees just to make it from day to day."
good,walk in ask my boss where they needed me they would usualy send me over to the mail room i would sort out the mail i would do it as  precise and quickly as possible
good,"Great for recent College graduates that don't have a lot of financial responsibilities, or professionals that are looking to start a new career with unlimited income potential"
good,"Medicare, Medicaid  Audit Hospital and Nursing homes for Mutual of Omaha as an intermediary for federal healthcare."
good,"Mutual of Omaha Investor Services requires a self-starter, hard work, and persistence.  As the owner of your own practice, you reap all the rewards as well as pay all the costs."
good,"Typical day at work involved taking inbound phone calls from policy holders and up selling them on additional insurance. As well as clients calling in for quotes on a policy. In the time I was with Mutual of Omaha I learned the ins and outs of the insurance business. I negotiated deals and closed sales. As far as management was concerned, I never had much of a manager to help with the coaching aspect of selling. My personal experience the hardest part of my job was knowing that I was not getting paid what I was worth. My co-workers were hands down the best part of my job. Got along great with everyone."
good,"Middle Management is pretty sad. They either don't know what's going on in their area, or they don't care... Most of the time work is easy and well paced, other times it's so slow and boring I just watch TV all day... At my desk. They have great classes, trainings, ERGs, and activities. There is probably a lot of room for PD but most of the career advancement seems nepotistic."
good,If you want to work at the same company for over 40 years then consider Mutual of Omaha! It’s been around for a long time and isn’t going anywhere. Lots of job security.
good,"Culture is nice, benefits are good including an annual bonus.  Technology is old depending what team you're on.  Mixed talent levels on each team as well."
good,"I worked in Medicare Supplement, as well as long-term care and disability."
good,"I enjoyed many years at Mutual. The medical unit was eventually sole to another company.  Mutual did not assist staff during the transition."
good,I loved my job at mutual of Omaha but definitely felt like that management was able to get away with retaliation. I was very pleased until I felt singled out by a specific manager.
good,It i a very fast paced and stressful job. you are sent through training then after training you are thrown out on to the floor to either sink or swim you have very little help and if you get help you are sent to the manual on the computer to look up what you need for information. management says they care but at the same time they turn away from you too.
good,Mutual is a fast growing customer focused organization.  They are growing their marketing presence.  The culture is great.  They are a great community partner allowing associates to spend work hours volunteering to improve the community.  The culture strongly encourages recognition of employees via online VIP system.
good,"Healthy working environment, everyone's opinion was valued. We had a great communication skill and everyone was on a same page. During slow days, we were given training for new skills."
good,"I work as an independent agent so I can't speak on the culture of the office. However, as a company, Mutual of Omaha is a household name that offers very affordable insurance products and makes it easy for an agent to help clients."
good,Productivity and culture mix well in the workplace. FLEXIBILITY in a few departments is scarce. The workplace culture is a big theme in the MOO community. New innovations are made everyday.
good,A typical day at Mutual of Omaha was helping customers with any and all insurance policy needs. Whether it was taking payments or answering all of their questions.
good,Very flexible with your time and great position to improve any skills while working part time.  This position helps you take a step into the professional world and start building a network.

good,Good people. The pay was decent. Good work/life balance. The CEO is smart and has a clear vision for where he wants the company to go. It's a mutual company so no shareholders other than the policy holders.
good,"Processing outgoing correspondance to policyholders.  Documents are folded and stuffed in envelopes for mail.  We were processing approximately 300,000 pieces per week."
good,Mutual of Omaha is a good place to develop work skills and learn new skills.  Have tuition reimbursement related to your job duties. Great location with ample food accommodations.
good,Will pay weekly and average pay among others that offer the same services. Currently own by one owner that will expect you to know what you tell him you know. good man but can will put you to the test.
good,Mutual of Omaha was a good place to work. My supervisor was wonderful and the people I worked with were great. There were issues with long hours and a lack of work/life balance.
good,"-Worked individually to create packets and brochures to send out to "
good,"Good company, old ways.  Do not stay up to date with the way banking is going today."
good,"Overall, the company is pretty good place to work. As in any big company, there are pockets of if you don't think our way, your life can be turned into misery."
good,"I set my own appointments and call on my own leads that are provided from a few different sources. The management team here is knowledgeable and hardworking and will to help in anyway. The most enjoyable part of what I do is the how I am compensated. Here at  Mutual of Omaha, you are compensated based on performance and with any company that leads to success."
good,1. To open and time sensitive mail and get it to the proper person in the Claims Department.
good,I mostly enjoyed working with the agents while recruiting with the managers. It was really a nice place to work. No complaints.
good,"Great support when needed, otherwise you are left to manage your marketing, prospecting and pipeline on your own.  Must take initiative because no one will offer to help, because everyone is seeking to build their own business."
good,"Planning the financial future for our clients.  Delivering on our promise to to provide a superior customer experience.  Making  the best financial decisions with my client's interest at heart.  Able to collaborate with co worker and management to make the right decisions for our clients.  I am able to take personal accountability for results, working within and beyond our areas of responsibility to ensure timely decision for our clients ultimate success."
good,I enjoy working at Mutual of Omaha. The culture is great and my co-workers are helpful and professional. I have not been impressed with the parking and flexibility in my department.
good,"Good work life balance  flexible schedule and advancement in career. Company has good compensation but doesn’t offer some benefits, such as medical dental and vision"
good,The regulation and restrictions made managing a portfolio challenging.  I don't know what else to say but Indeed is requiring me to type more to meet a quota.
good,"Liked job environment, co-workers and supervisors. Did not like the job itself. Had taken the job because I needed a paycheck. Supervisors were very reasonable about job expectations."
good,Overall it's company is great. Customer Care Analyst Health position is a really tough job with the high call volume that has inceased this past year.
good,Frustrated with overall politics in customer contact center. Excellent company with great benefits for employees. Not a clear advancement pathway and not easy to move inside company.
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,Mutual of Omaha is a large company with segmented departments that give the company a small company feel. Personalized feeling with department management.
good,"I was good in the Customer Service department, tried to advance myself into another position, and quickly learned it was very competitive and very cut throat."
good,Great people!. Team oriented goals and above average customer service. Management was new and it was more misunderstanding along with friendships trumped actually work productivity.
good,Mutual was an 'okay' place to work.  It's a big company so its easy to get lost in the crowd and feel like a number.  They seem to put more concern into their Midtown 'project' then they do the insurance company.
good,"Good work/life balance and decent pay as an entry level. Starbucks, Chick fil A in building. You can people watch on your break because there is a great diversity of employees. But parking is limited."
good,"A typical day at work consist of making cold calls, door knocking and attending networking events to bring in new business. Working daily with customer and resolving issues. Working with business partners to bring in new clients and making sure the clients are in the right products. The hardest part of the job is since it is a small bank I have to double sale. First I have to sell myself then the bank to make the prospect comfortable to move their banking relationship over. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and business owners and learning about their business and lives."
good,"If you've worked for a community bank and a corporate bank you'll fit right in. Customer service is in line with sales. They are always changing, but only to better their business model."
good,"I loved what I did at Mutual, and had excellent co-workers.  I felt what I did was valuable and valued.  "
good,"A typical day at work consists of marketing, calling, and servicing clients on their insurance and investment planning. I have learned a great deal about the Financial sector and its place in small to large business planning. Management is great, we have a team of product specialists to lean on for complicated cases, and a management team that works around the clock to ensure success. The hardest part of the job is the consistency of compensation and the length of the sales process. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with a diverse group of people and helping them plan for their future."
good,"I enjoyed my years with MOO.  Great company but management was lacking in consistently.  I had 4 managers and 2 RVP's in the 5 years that I was with Mutual.  This inconsistency was difficult to gain traction in the market at times.  With that being said, I loved the people that I worked with and was proud of what we accomplished in building the brand in the inland NW."
good,"The company itself is great.  I enjoyed working there.  But not everyone is cut out for sales.  If you are, highly recommend working for Mutual of Omaha."
good,Great place to work as far as flexibility goes but hard to move within the company. Not as many chances for advancement as I thought it would have
good,"Pay was good, but wasn’t quite enough to cover the cost of quality childcare in the area, so plan accordingly. "
good,"As long as you know that you are there to work and not make friends, you will be fine. Also keep  in mind, you will be worked beyond your capacity. They claim to be understanding, but in reality, they are a business and they are in competition. So it's all about numbers, it doesn't matter how much stress they put on you."
good,no review at this time I'm not interested in talking about my time at Mutual of Omaha overall the job was good just my branch manager was the issue working here.
good,"The people in the office were really great, kind, and helpful. However, I didn't just fit in as a younger associate. They do a great job of training, but there is also pressure to make sales right away."
good,This was a fast paced job. No two days were ever the same which was the best part of the position. I worked closely with my manager and enjoyed being able to help in special projects as needed. This was a position that required discretion due to the sometimes sensitive nature of the work. You were expected to arrive on time and be present and accountable for your work.
good,"Good Company to work for. Very competitive products, but underwriting is very strict and takes to long to get a policy issued. Should go computerized with their applications."
good,it was Great to be in position where i learned and Gain alot Experience in the Work force and Grown Alot from it. The culture there was very warmth and friendly.
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."
good,"A very stable company with competent leadership.  Associates and teams are not very welcoming to new people, especially when they are brought in to lead change initiatives."
good,"Wonderful work life balance. Your compensation is based on your individual work habits and enthusiasm. The compensation package is very favorable while building your business base.Client prospecting is the biggest challenge with this business, however you are provided with access to an existing client base which give you a solid foundation for growth potential."
good,"Call center activities where I was available to answer questions on insurance policies, up sell & promote additional products & assist with payment transactions."

good,"You're not an employee, you're a contract worker."

good,"Mutual of Omaha is a Fortune 500 mutual insurance and financial services company based in Omaha, Nebraska."
good,"Appreciate the training and support.  Staff at office very knowledgeble and supportive.  Management is engaged.  Home Office personnel ""Nebraska"" nice."
good,Good intentioned company and management but so slow to adopt progressive technology and change old processes and practices.  To dependent on antiquated direct mail and little appetite for tv advertising deciding to rely on Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom legacy for awareness which will be irrelevant or unknown by its coming of age target market.
good,"Each day is busy where clear and concise reporting is required. It's a large company, so don't be surprised if you feel like you're lost in the crowd. Head down, work hard and you will be fine."
good,"This opportunity is strictly sales.  If you are good at finding potential future clients, and not infringing on their space, you might be successful at this position."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the internal & external partners who I still call my friends.  There some opportunity for advancement, but there were also some job eliminations."
good,"They do their best to ensure the employees are well cared for. "
good,"Employees are great, sales agents are great, even lower management is great. General Manager of the GNYC office is uneducated. Work is easy and fulfilling."
good,"Mutual of Omaha was  decent company. They had great hours, a nice work environment, and casual dress code. I did not like the fact that i felt disposable though or like at any moment i could lose my job."
good,"Great Company! The company truly cares about all employees, and management makes a very good effort to show employees where the company has been and where it is going."
good,"A  typical day was spent with recruiting activities, training, customer service and completing tasks assigned from the home office along with the normal management activities."
good,What I enjoy the most is creating both customer and coworker relationships. This the the key to sales growth. The toughest part of the job is finding the right people.
good,"Mutual of Omaha is a great company that really does take care of its employees. I worked in the call center and really enjoyed my time there. If they had regular positions and not just temporary I would probably still be there. One thing I really liked was the advancement opportunities. All of the supervisors but one had worked there way up from a call center representative, which made them very knowledgeable about what you were going through and needed."
good,"Started at 6:00 AM and ended at 3:00 Monday thru Friday."

good,"While the job was not as challenging as I had hoped it to be, I enjoyed my team and management very much. Everyone had a good rapport and it was relatively easy to accomplish a job with great support. It was not as easy to move up the title chain due to job codes and such, but I was always treated with respect."
good,Great company with a long track record of good business practices. Can be difficult if you don't know the right people. It's a tough market to enter with little start-up support. Can be a very rewarding career long-term.
good,"After former bank closure and acquisition with new bank, lots of changes took place, cross-training as staff-size decreased. Busy workdays in multiple tasks and division's sub-departments."
good,"I presently work here and enjoy the independence of working and managing my own business. Mutual of Omaha is a great institution, and a fortune 500 Company. There are no benefits or steady income in doing this job, and I feel that I need to have more stability in my work as well as my income."
good,"During my 2 year period of working at Mutual of Omaha, I found that I really enjoyed meeting each month with your supervisor to go over your skills and progression, while determining the pros and cons of your work. If needed, they advised areas of improvement, or extended the help needed to get you where you needed to be, without feeling like you were failing. Overall, I think this company was a great place to work, and advance within the Company if given the opportunity."
good,"Mutual of Omaha is a very good insurance company, but success really depends on your own personal background. A 25 year old with no base in business is going to find it much more difficult to be successful than the 45 year old with established business and community involvement."
good,Very well household name. But lost intrest when they dropped USA Swimming.The bulk of my business drive and book of business was through this company support.
good,Fun atmosphere with collaborative and good management. The speed of the culture takes getting used too. The most enjoyable part of job was the management and the flexible work schedule.

good,Unlimited potential.  The work is hard but it you put in the hours you can make a good income.  There has been many changes in upper mgmt. with new training methods.
good,"Well balanced  between work and family.  I would still be there if they had the Medicare Program that I was hired into.  They are notorious for just putting  boxes on peoples desks and when they come in the next day, they have boxes on their desks to say to pack their belongings and they are done."
good,Great company culture that provides for a great opportunity for advancement. Truly a Company where what you get out of your experience depends on what you put in. Would recommend to a friend.
good,"Managed  8 employees, responsible for over all function of branch, including but not limit to, opening closing, customer satisfaction, compliance training, employee reviews etc."
good,I think Mutual is a great company for the right person in the right position. I felt they were really great but the job I did in Disability claims was heart wrenching.

good,Great place with lots of freedom to run your own company. endless income potential. great job for the first time sale rep.
good,"Productive and busy work place that allows areas for more learning.  I currently work on the financial and claims sides of Medicare Supplements, Long term and Short term Disability, Critical Illness, Cancer, Dental and Long Term Care individual policies.  I also was advanced to be able to process and data enter account cancellation and refunds for client policies. I would say the hardest part of my job is finding information on all the different type policies that I work with.  The enjoyable part is know that I have help my clients and they are happy after our encounter after the services I have them on their policies."
good,"From the ERGs, to the overall family culture. Mutual of Omaha is just a wonderful place to not only work, but connect with others. My time at Mutual has been nothing short of amazing."

good,"Strict schedule adherence and availability leads to a very high volume of inbound calls of customer service, quoting and selling insurance. I learned how to be very efficient at multi-tasking and staying focused throughout the day to keep up with goals and expectations. "
good,"Very, very conservative company. Got out of the health market when the regulations changed back in the mid-90s. Compensation structure only rewards producers.  Not something you can do part-time.  They provide every resource for you to succeed.  Just remember prospect hard. Get the potential client to like you (not wanting to end the relationship) and close by asking for the sale a minimum of 5 times."
good,"I enjoyed being busy and there was a lot of work. The coworkers were very enjoyable and the atmosphere was calm and friendly. There were convenient places within the building for employees use, hair and nail salon, dry cleaner, and small convenience store."
good,"day to day activity was not appreciated, no talking was allowed during work hours, cell phones were prohibited, I gained a lot of knowledge from my previous manager, it was untill new management came in that I didn't excel any further. the culture was progressing to a poing then it just went down hill, it was an easy job, management made it difficult."

good,The corporate office is nice. Mutual also became a real estate company and beautified the surrounding area.  Unfortunately they got out of the Medicare business.
good,I was part of the management team and it was a great place to work until we got a new manager. He was a jerk and told me (not in so many words) that I was an expense he preferred NOT to have. He then cut my bonuses to about 1/3 and decreased my recruiting budget to the point where I couldn't even effectively do my job.
good,"Data entry computer work"
good,"Provides challenging opportunities to grow with the company. Good management that allows you to learn, make mistakes, and grow. Did not micro manage employees."
good,Learned a ton of experience working with clients and how to interact with others.

I was fortunate enough to have some of the most supportive managers while at MOO.  I have held on to a number of close friendships that are still at MOO. One of the hardest parts of my last job as an HR Specialist was to leave a company that I worked for half of my life.  The most enjoyable part of the HR position was being able to assist managers in a way that was both satisfying to them and at times rewarding for the employee."
good,"I managed up to 40 people so I never had a ""typical"" day.  The consistent parts to each day were payroll, excel spreadsheets showing daily work and goals, providing work guidance, making sure goals were met and exceeded, huddles with my teams to prepare for each day, being available to answer questions or concerns from my teams, my management, my internal and external customers."

good,"I have worked at several leading companies and Mutual of Omaha Mortgage is a special, high-level performance operation for a loan originator. They have excellent pricing, excellent work-life balance and highly competitive leads. 2020 will be our break-out year and I am thrilled to be a part of it. Only downsides are there isn't much career mobility, and it's a sales job thus your performance / productivity determines your pay-check. If you want a cushy salary job, this isn't for you. But if you work your leads and enjoy commission sales, prepare to make up to 100K while working mostly from home."
good,"Mutual of Omaha is an old school Midwestern company that treats it's folks with consideration and empathy.  In financial services industry, it is uncommonly rare."
good,"The job was very self paced, I was an individual sales agent and straight commisioned. The only thing was challanging was optaining and new leds . Most of my sales was self obtained and pound the pavement if you might say."
good,"It was fit for me stressful"
good,When I worked there it was a great company. Management kept employees informed with what was happening in the company and how it would affect your role in the company. The pay was great for the area. Advancement is always available and the benefits and 401K was available almost from the beginning of employment. If I ever moved back to the area. I would reapply.

good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to work hard everyday and see results. I enjoy meeting goals and making management feel that they can trust me. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page to help out and do their part equally. I have/had great managers.

Education was great, there was something to learn everyday and when people had to use their insurance for sickness or death, it gave a sense of helping them through a difficult time, that they had the money to take care of whatever the need was at a time. You are part of a team.  Now teams are a big thing in business but teams were really big over twenty years ago."

A typical day was always busy, they allowed you to work other duties so you could learn other positions, I enjoyed working with co workers, of course you had those that were hard to work with but, its up to you on how you handle it. The hardest part that I had was when I first started learning how to pay claims, but after the training it became easier as you went along, the most enjoyable part of my job at Mutual of Omaha, was making sure the customer was satisfied with their policy."

It is up to me and the client to make sure they have adequate life insurance coverage to secure their finances in the event of a death.
good,"A day of interning at Mutual of Omaha is very fast paced, working hard to close deals, but most importantly to make sure every person i come into contact with has some type of insurance. My learning experience enhanced while learning to be slow and patient, understanding why the person has not had insurance and to give my best suggestion as to what will be best for them. My co-workers are always helpful being that everyone is in competition with each other, we are all looking to accomplish the same goal. The hardest part about the job is to understand the answer no, everyone at the end of the day will need insurance but yours just might not be what they are looking for. My most enjoyable part of the job is to get out and meet new people, networking is always best."

good,Mutual of Omaha was a great place to work and had great benefits.  My reason was health related.  There was a lot of production goals but that was good as each employee was treated the same and had same expectations!!!
good,This was my picture perfect job outside of high school. Working at a Fortune 500 company is my second favorite job upon your unrealistic job of being famous. After high school I hired on immediately and I was there for two years.
good,"The company can be hardass's, like any company.  But they are fair and they do explain what's going on.  If there are personality conflicts with other coworkers or managers, they will try to simply relocate you in the building."
good,This is a great place to work. There is a lot of information to learn and the environment is very fast paced but there are a lot of resources to learn from. And a lot of help to comprehend the material.

good,"When I first started as an agent I knew the sky was the limit. I also knew I had to work hard for it. No one was going to just wake up and give me anything. I followed the process Mutual teaches, I worked in the office, with the team, and in the community. I used every resource Mutual gives us, and you don't see me crying for a salary. I make more than most the people I know because I used what Mutual gave me and taught me. I love that every day is different and that I get to see my clients and work with them face-to-face. I see people crying on here about charge-backs - take advantage of being non-captive and offer other companies. That way people can shop around with you. If you're not talking to your clients, someone else is. So keep up with them. If the insurance is getting too expensive, help them find something that is not so difficult. The management and support staff is amazing - they would do and have done anything and everything for us to succeed. The Chonofsky office is great - they are the top division in Mutual and have a 5-star team in upper management. Very excited to see where my career goes!"

I have learned that selling insurance is more than just another product, but it is a need for everyone.  The management team is wonderful and they are there to ask any questions I may have about application and underwriting.  The hardest part of the job is receiving chargebacks (money I have to pay back if the client do not keep the policy for a certain period of time)."
