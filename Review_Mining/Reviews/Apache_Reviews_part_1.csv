rating,review
bad,"you are just another number on their payroll. they don't offer hardly any benefits and lay you off with no notice in the middle of the week. management is very poor, and only those who are friends get to stay when the lay offs come."
bad,"Not a company I would ever go back to, I was laid off and it was the best thing that happened to me there. Very shady place. Management was very hard to work with."
bad,"Apache Belt and Hose is being acquired by Motion Industries, and as a result are under a hiring freeze.  That information isn't freely available to temps who sign on, many of whom believe they are in the running for full time work."
bad,A typical day at APACHE is constant repairs in the plant to make sure it was operating correctly. The operations and maintenance was a every day and every minute alert.
bad,Apache is a great place to work and makes me happy to see a task complete. And the most important thing is to see everyone going home safe to come back the next day.
good,"Avis assez positif, stage enrichissant, entreprise à taille humaine, mais management assez décevant"
good,The long hrs almost every day was tuff I would have little time with family. The good part about it that they gave me the opportunity to  learned to spray paint and I took advantage of it.
good,"A company with a great culture at the grass roots level. Management has difficulty with holding people accountable and affecting real change. When they do hold people accountable, it causes ripple affects to the mid level managers that senior management doesn't want to address so the cycle perpetuates and positive change can't be achieved."
good,It started off a very good environment but it got out of hand with no real leadership. I dislike not having organization in a work place.
good,Alright couldn't get hours because i was a great worker so they kept me on maintenance and they hired ppl to get on turn around and refuse me of hours
good,"HR will find an excuse for you not to move up in the company against Management requests if they do not approve of you, yet for people they do like, a position can be made up for them and them alone. If you are not in a certain favored department, you are looked down. on."
good,I have had the opportunity to work with some of the most interesting people in the work force.  Room for advancment was limited and the selection process is unfair.
good,"The jail was getting too crowded and we did not have the available work force to keep everyone safe. Management did not care and neglected to do anything about it, and due to my disagreement with the way things were being run, I resigned from Detention Corporal"
good,"All walks of life, gentleman and women that come from all over the world, willing to make a honest pay check, this company gives 2nd chances for those that have an criminal background. working as a safety advisor alone side many ethnic groups was rewarding to get to tap into multi-cultures."
good,"Fair experience  it was good working with some of the people,I enjoyed learning!The perdium was the main attraction however when that ended it was r time to move on."
good,My beginning at this job was not at all unpleasant.  I learned a lot about logistics and the overall process of shipping and receiving.  The only downside to working here was the hiring of a few hard drug users that would conduct drug deals in the parking lot during company time.  Concerns about this were repeatedly ignored.
good,Apache was a good company while it lasted. Great benefits and a lot of good people there. Just like everyone else got caught up in the reduction.
good,A good typical day at work is wen it is not raining.the new thing that i learn wuzz how to bristle blast.The management wuzz very good.All of the co-workers were good people the work with they teach you different things.the most enjoyable part of the job is wen we get to go home to our families.
good,Apache is an growing company so it may seem slow at first. If you put time and trust in supervision things will work out. They find long term jobs which is their best asset.
good,I would probably not work for them no more I did not like the management the guy I worked for was very rude did not want you to take breaks one break a day
good,"Bonne équipe"
good,Apache à été ma première expérience dans le monde du travaille ce qui ma fait évoluer à mes suivantes périodes de stages
good,"BUENO"
good,A Decent Company with manageable work. Poor planing/workflow causing major overtime as materials get lost/misordered. Problems stem from under staffing for periods of over a year but the company pushing overgrowth despite lack of personel. The company prides itself on its employee owners and for the most part everyone is treated well and with respect.

good,"A typical day is busy, work is steady even in the downturn. Training could be improved on. There is no official training program and documentation is space, outdated or incomplete. Coworkers are great, cafe and benefits are great."
good,Unless you are an engineer there are very few advancement opportunities.  No credit given for other industry experience. Most advancement is through tenure whether competent or not.  Company will not get rid of dead weight.
good,"Apache is a good place to work however the guys can create un-needed drama as many of the upper management thinks they are ""Macho"" and do not want to listen to the actual production workers about various things. If they do not like you- they will make sure to push your buttons until you want to quit. Good benefits, Good Pay however a quick turnaround as they expect a lot out of new employees without as much training as they  may need."

I look forward to being able to work with them and Apache again.
good,Well I was contracted by Apache through Genesys Works and when I began I was shy since it was my first day at work. But I made friends quickly and when i needed help with any problems on pipelines I would ask my coworker for some help.
