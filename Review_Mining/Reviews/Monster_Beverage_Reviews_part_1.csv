rating,review
bad,"Worked under contract for a department filled with an equal ratio of decent and helpful people and two face, suicide self-entitled rude mediocre people. Management is extremely poor and not personable, pay is dismal and group culture is broke, lots of alcoholics. Just depressing lunch rooms and swinging with sues. Run away"
bad,"a hotbed for unskilled un educated people. A very bad place to work. Terrible management, culture is bad. Very negative vibe throughout the marketing area and graphics area. Many law suits have already happened and are now on going for many employees. Would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,long long long work hours. Culture is very political. Under paid. no advancement. micro managing is extreme here. no lifestyle balance. high turnover.
bad,Disrespectful management. Pay is LOW and communication skills of Cooperate is extremely poor and unprofessional. The work is NOT consistent and write-ups are handed out like candy.
bad,"Long Island MAT Team (Farmingdale, NY):"
bad,"Early on working at Monster the job and raptor was good, a the company grew, we became disconnected.  They made sure you felt like you were easily replaceable and told you that. It became very difficult to work with a company with such a lack of integrity.  Misconduct is tolerated by men and you will get punished for speaking out about it."
bad,"It was the worst place I've worked for the last 10 years. Full of blaming game and unfair work-life balance and Poor Management."
bad,Make your own schedule which was great. But then you never when or if you would ever be scheduled.
bad,"DEFINITELY a ""click"" atmosphere.  NO fairness, managers they have their favorites. Work ethic is seriously questionable. ""Millenial"" culture. I am not even 40, but this is just ridiculous. Run from this place!"
bad,Not worth working at drama zone even when your not even in it just get pulled. Not worth working at only great thing are the benefits other than that the drama will get to you
bad,"I worked with the company for 3 years and gave it my all. I worked late and weekends and never had a poor review or got written up until I was forced into a position that was originally for me to lend a helping hand. Several people were in and then out of Monster in my short time there, 10-15 at least, and 2 of those people quit at the same time. Long story short, I was forced out of my old position, into this horrific position that was extremely high stress (I always wondered what was wrong with the girl who worked in the position prior to me and now I know) with no training, and had to train another employee. I stepped up and did the job only to be able targeted on a daily basis (getting called into the office, written up, being told I “look unhappy” and I’d have to fix that) I was in and out of HR 4-5 times, reaching out to see if there was anything I could do. Ultimately, I left the position. Be cautious about working here. You see all the reports about HR and the company not really caring about their employees. It’s TRUE! I never thought this would happen. I loved my job and worked very hard. It’s disheartening."
bad,"Monster Energy is a great place to work and I learned an incredible amount of knowledge through them. "
bad,"The management is so lax that there is hardly any supervision going on and too much gossip happening. Immature hostile environment."
bad,unload/ load trucks. pull and stage product. no communication with lower and upper management. co-workers were cool with me.
bad,by far one of the worst jobs ive had people at the company are stuck up and rude and also the human resources lady micromanaged and constantly nitpicked every little thing pay sucked
bad,Doing online marketing and need to monitoring social media accounts of the organisation. Writing and doing research for advertisement to be posted on the networking.
good,"Very clicky. Depends on whose butt you kiss on how you're going to get promoted honestly. If you don't mesh with the upper management, they will figure out a way to push you out, no matter what. Certain VP's get their pockets padded by carriers for the carriers to get freight (they basically get taken on fishing trips, taken to hockey games, etc) on company time, yet it's frowned upon if anyone else goes to lunch with other managers. Ironic right. Just a backwards way of doing business. Maybe Coke will handle it better"
good,"Busy from start, free monster energy drinks for employees, strict place cameras are watching your every step makes it very uncomfortable to work, most enjoyable part of the was getting off."
good,I got the opportunity to travel with the company for a quite a while; the events were very entertaining and some of the co-workers were great to be around.
good,"The hardest part of my job was trying to keep the peace within the company itself. I love the overall job itself, but I believe that being in the role of manager I should be able to make more managerial decisions."
good,"You would think your role would be a lot more exciting working for Monster Energy. Unfortunately, the pay is below average for brand ambassador work and the hours are scarce. I was hoping to work around 25-28 hours a week, but really only wind up with 10-18. The lead for my area is not very sociable, so communication gets blurry. I enjoy the work and people on my team, however, it's not the fun work environment I thought it was going to be. There's no team building, incentives for being the employees doing all the advertising nor true advancement opportunities."
good,"Typical day at work was to unload trucks put merchandise away, pull orders and load trucks. I learned how to be more efficient on unloading, loading and pulling orders. Management was not that good in my opinion cause they wouldn't manage the work flow evenly between shifts. Co-workers were all good to work with. The hardest part of the job were the long hours, 12 hours a day and sometimes more. Just having a job was enjoyable to me."
good,"You show up!, read your emails, some unrealistic demands show up! from sales, you try too do your best to help!, bad music over the intercoms all day, their isn't nothing really cool at HQ, no ramp. no ping pong, no, nothing! if you want too move up! it won't happen at Monster unless your friends with owners or VP's"
good,"Though this company is fun to work for with great benefits, there are a some culture issues to be very weary of."
good,"""Impulse"" Magasins de proximité."
good,"The position I had was very stressful and cut throat."
good,The job itself was fun and paid very well. You can give your availability so it is very flexible which is great for school. The manager in this position in Okc is horrible. She talks badly about her employees to other employees and sends very hateful messages. Great job if you can handle someone constantly treating her employees poorly. Would have stayed entire college career if not for management.
good,Job can be very cool at times but my biggest gripe is upper management never considers lower level employee ideas no matter how good.  They are very set in their ways.  Hours can be cut at any moment.
good,"Nothing Special working at the Monster Distribution Center in Corona, its a job and can't expect more than that.  The benefits are relatively good compare to other companies."
good,Saludos cordiales y conversaciones de trajo amigables.
good,The management wasn’t the best but the environment wasn’t too bad either. The work itself isn’t difficult and overall a decent place to work at with good pay.
good,"A lot of changes going on  I don't have a lot to say. I did learn a lot more about working for difficult people.  Learning about regulatory process has been very interesting and would like to learn more about it."
good,"temp job, was an okay job not the busiest place friendly team , it was a simple job checking expenses and parking invoices on SAP ,  the company offered free energy drinks and was close to home"
good,Great place to work at. got to experience a lot during my time. Long commute was the reason. Besides that I was an amazing place
good,"Monster Energy was a productive workplace, opportunity to gain meaningful experience, acqiured sales and business acumen, and enjoyed the people"
good,"Overall a fun job, just a lot of driving. The hardest part of the job would be people at stores being rude to you."
good,Invasive work/life balance. This is a good position for single people. I worked remotely and did not have access to office relationships. Most advancement came from the home office.
good,"It has been a very great experience working for Monster Energy Corp."
good,"Incredibly low pay compared to competitors, not worth the time. Management is nice, time off is easy as you make your own schedule (good for students.)"
good,"Challenging jobs on a daily basis, learning to work on distributor claims. The hardest part of my  job is dealing with co-workers that are disrespectful and don't know what there doing."
good,It has been an overall good company to work for. It has given me a good stable job for the past four years and I’m grateful. The days go by smoothly and the work is easy enough to understand and get done in a timely ma
good,"Monster energy was a very fast paced company, I enjoyed that aspect of it, the sales calls rodeo game with sales reps, building displays. There is slot of out of market time spent in other cities & states, it can become difficult to be away from a young family."
good,"Worked with local distributors and their sales forces to increase product sales, placement, P.O.S, and other market support."
good,I had fun but I'm looking for a new career. I want to have more benefits and better pay. My job does not pay me enough for the cost of living. I need a much better job where I can advance and be more productive.
good,"good paying job, only down fall in 24 hr call, hard to be there for the family when your not sure when your going or coming home, owners are good people"
good,"Any education is good learning. I take the time to learn and benefit from every position/situation I am in. The past 10 years with Monster got me going on a life I didnt know I was missing out on. With it, I realized I like working with numbers and applying the knowledge to business related analysis."
good,"Plenty of opportunity to travel, working in a team for most of the time, it can be physically demending but never boring. Extreme and motor sport lovers, I definitely suggest you to have a go."
good,"- Montaje de eventos estratégicos de acuerdo a las costumbres de cada zona rural o urbana dentro del Perú, para la entrega del producto al consumidor final. "
good,Company allows you to handle things yourself. Great sales experience and opportunities to grow. Management is very helpful and wants you to succeed.
good,"Great company to work for. Extremely fun job! Monster energy is an excellent starting job for the young person. Moving up in the company is very competitive. The company is still growing and very enthusiastic about making new positions. I've worked for the company going on about five years now and I've had a blast. If I could I would make this my only job but like I said moving up is extremely competitive and they're open to inside and outside candidates at the moment. They don't have that many full-time positions available but if you can grab one, the sky is the limit. The people are exciting to be around and wonderful to work with."
good,"Expanding the brand on the east coast, specifically New York City."
good,You get to drive around in a huge truck and do some incredible things.
good,El trabajo estaba bastante bien. El problema es que no te facilitaban sillas ya que tenías que estar las 8 horas de pie. La relacion era profesional pero a gusto.
good,"Ce poste ma permis de découvrir une nouvelle facette de la distribution qui est celle des cash and carry et des grossites. J'ai dût dévelloper les plus gros clients de France et d'Europe (Metro Bobigny, Vitry, Evry ...). J'ai appris beaucoup de nouvelles choses et acquis de nouvelles compétences en ce qui concerne le management ou la négociation."
good,"A typical day is working with distributor salesmen, educating them on the product, and backing them up to increase distribution across the brand."
good,"Great job. A bit of favoritism is played with regards to promotions, but otherwise awesome co-workers and atmosphere. Management doesn't always get feedback from established employees before making changes for the sake of change."
good,"set hours for my role. decent benefits. management  could manage better in some departments. overall good experience of this organization. "
good,"Great boss, fun job. was just a contracted employee for the two years, but liked working there and everyone in the company seemed nice and easy to work with."
good,I loved going into work. Everyone was friendly and very helpful when I first started. The only problem was that many days we were told not to go into work due to work shortages.
good,The company overall is ok company to work.  It depends department managers.  Some department are good some are not.  some managers no good management skills.
good,The best and smallest HR group I have ever worked with. I enjoy the laid back dressed down culture that Monster has created.
good,While Monster Energy may well inspire people imaginations of extreme sports being conducted in the front lobby the truth is beyond the veneer the company and people are the same everywhere. While the compensation is fair and they do care of their employees I would say it is very well endowed with personal favoritism. Advancement can be very slow unless you personal relationships are forged. While many departments are structured this way there is the befit of working for a company that is geared towards the younger set but still remains grounded. That and the free drinks from the coolers are an added bonus on every floor .
good,Promote and distribute energy drinks at different events or during street sampling.
good,"Had great equipment , a typical day would be driving to the events"
good,Employees send in their availability weekly in order to be put on to the schedule. It is great for any college student. You get to attend cool events and your co-workers become life long friends.
good,"My time working for monster was absolutely fantastic. It was a great college job and the pay was nice considering my expenses were very low. If you want to work for them you must be self driven, you do not have a supervisor looking over you."
good,"at monster, i experienced events and promos that would have been impossible without this job. a typical day consisted of driving 30-90 minutes to a promo event passing out energy drinks until its completely gone."
good,I love this company. The brand creates a very exciting atmosphere. This company is a non-traditional company which makes it all the more fun. The only issue is Management training and advancement. The opportunities are very limited and training does not exist. The only way you will advance is if you are willing to relocate which isn't a problem and if you know someone.(sometimes)
good,It`s a great place to work and be a part of. The culture promotes a lot from within with that being said your ability to meet others in the company and move up is all on you.
good,"Overall, This is a great job! very fun. Provides a lot of opportunities for networking and building connections. Although seems to be a difficult position within the company to move up in."
good,"Overall, working as a brand ambassador for Monster Energy has been a great experience.  As an ambassador with 8 years of experience I've definitely had my share of positions that have ranged from fun to grueling, and Monster Energy is definitely up pretty high on my list.  Management is good, the events are usually pretty fun and easy, and of course, if you're a people person like I am you'll never hate your job!"
good,"The attitudes, morals, and values that I have learnt can gain or lose all through the advertising of Monster and cannot only directly affect myself but also others around me. It is easy to get lost in the allure and glamour of the life associated with this action-oriented beverage and it is not always so easy to escape."
good,I really like this company. They have helped me evolve into a working brand ambassador. They are a great company to work for. They have lots of benefits.
good,This was a great college job if you are looking for something that is flexible. I was happy with the company for the short time i worked with them. They cared about their employees.
good,Being a merchandiser for this company is not bad at all. Easy work as long as you can do constant lifting and have good customer service skills. Drive half time and work the rest.
good,Its extremely fast pasted of having to move product from location to location. Also having to make sure product is loaded properly onto shipping containers making sure no damage to product due to loading. Making sure product gets shipped in order that we received it.
good,"Monster Energy Company provides a great working environment with opportunities to grow within the company. Monster is located in Corona, CA."
good,A typical day of work as a Brand Ambassador for Monster Energy Company consists of either business sampling or sampling events. I have learned different techniques for guerilla marketing and I have gained knowledge about the company and the people that work for it. My coworkers with this job were fantastic; I got along so well with all of them and they have become good friends of mine. The hardest part of the job is not knowing how your day is going to go; guerilla sampling can be difficult because some people are not going to want you around and some people are going to be overly ecstatic about your presence.  The most enjoyable part about the job is working with people who have a similar interest with you and working events. Events are an excellent way to meet and network with many different kinds of people.
good,"Pros. Great pay with great benefits and free product. "
good,"you learn a lot about sales as the company continues to dominate and grow,"
good,it was great being able to work the hours I wanted to. I truly enjoyed interacting with the other students on CMU's campus
good,"A company with a fun culture and good people.  Being an outside sales job, you are always engaging with people, spending time outside, given a van to drive from store to store, weekly ""wins"" conference calls and presentations to talk about successes.

good,"Really enjoyed working with the company, was really well organised and managed well. All the team worked together and helped each other where needed."
good,Good job for what it is. The job is pretty enjoyable if you like your team. You don't have to do much besides hand out free samples to the general population.
good,"I had the opportunity to  work at Monster as a temporary employee.  The position I held was a position I knew was being eliminated due to the merge of Monster and Coca Cola. "
good,Monster Energy is a great place to work for if you are looking to make your hours and do not have a lot of bills to pay. It is very hard to get a full time position and it is even harder to move up in the company.
good,Working with Monster was a fun experience and gave me plenty of opportunities. They treated me fairly and paid me well. Although it was a zero hour contract they offered me plenty of work.
good,Great team work environment! Fun part-time job for college students. Flexible schedule.  Offers summer internships for interested business students. !

good,Responsible for operation of company vehicle to attend various events and local businesses in order to educate and promote brand awareness to drive sales.
good,"Dealt with major beverage distributors throughout nation and internationally to assist in distribution of brand. Never a dull moment.  Great company to work for! Thoroughly enjoyed working with my fellow associates/co-workers. The hardest part of my job was that I couldn't say no to a co-worker if they needed my assistance.  After being employed there for almost 3 years.  I gained alot of knowledge in the industry.  So, I became very resourceful.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being a valued team member and simply receiving a ""thank you"" from upper management for a job well done.  The fact that they noticed me for my work meant alot."
good,Monster Energy is one of the best companies I've worked for. The culture is very unique and casual while everyone is very hard at work at the same time.
good,I worked for a local distribution company that worked for monster but it was a pretty great experience. The schedule was very flexible and you were pretty much your own boss.
good,Every day at Monster is a great day. Obviously there are going to be days that are better than others but overall it is a fun and inclusive work environment. I travel to a different place time I clock in and I appreciate the ever changing work enviroment. One thing I enjoy most about my job is that my manager always supplies me with the essential supplies needed to approatley do my job.
good,"The Monster Brand Ambassador position is a super flexible, awesome part time job for college students and recent grads who want bottom line experience in PR/Marketing.

good,I love working with Monster Energy! I have wonderful co-workers and a wonderful boss!

It is a revolving door of temps that do not like the fast pace or the smell of all the raw materials that are use to make the batches. The people that stick around long enough to get hired through the company find out that they do not like the pay and look somewhere else."
